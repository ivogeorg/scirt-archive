scirt-archive
=============

# Overview
This repository contains a first trial version of a UIMA-based corpus pipeline for scientific publications. It is a legacy solution based on UIMA only (as opposed to uimaFIT) and was used to create the corpus SCIRT 0.0.1. The repository is meant to be a frozen archive. Subsequent development of the coprus pipeline and the SCIRT corpus can be found in https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/scirt-dev.

# Platform
This project was developed on Windows 8 64-bit, Eclipse Kepler 64-bit, Java 7. Eclipse workspace settings will contain Windows paths.

# Corpus
The coprus can be found under https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/scirt-archive/tree/master/data. The files can be visulized in [brat](http://brat.nlplab.org/).
