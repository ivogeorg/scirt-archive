After spinal cord injury (SCi), re-establishing functional circuitry in the damaged central nervous system (CNS) 
faces multiple challenges including lost tissue volume, insufficient intrinsic growth capacity of adult neurons, 
and the inhibitory environment in the damaged CNS. Several treatment strategies have been developed 
over the past three decades, but successful restoration of sensory and motor functions will probably require 
a combination of approaches to address different aspects of the problem. Degradation of the chondroitin 
sulfate proteoglycans with the chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) enzyme removes a regeneration barrier from the 
glial scar and increases plasticity in the CNS by removing perineuronal nets. its mechanism of action does 
not clash or overlap with most of the other treatment strategies, making ChABC an attractive candidate as a 
combinational partner with other methods. in this article, we review studies in rat SCi models using ChABC 
combined with other treatments including cell implantation, growth factors, myelin-inhibitory molecule blockers, 
and ion channel expression. We discuss possible ways to optimize treatment protocols for future combinational 
studies. To date, combinational therapies with ChABC have shown synergistic effects with several other 
strategies in enhancing functional recovery after SCi. These combinatorial approaches can now be developed 
for clinical application.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCi) patients are usually left disabled for 
life. The two primary causes of SCi are vehicle accidents 
and falling from heights. Along with the rapid economic 
growth in China, the rate of SCi occurrence in Beijing has 
rapidly increased 10 times from 6.8 per million in the 1980s 
to 60.6 per million in 2002[1].
Following SCi, the challenge of restoring central 
nervous system (CNS) function faces difficulties in multiple 
areas. Research in the past three decades has provided 
several potential solutions by addressing different aspects 
of the problem. The strategies developed have included 
cell implantation, neurotrophin supplementation, and 
treatments to increase CNS plasticity. However, due to the 
complexity of the injured spinal cord, a single-treatment 
approach will probably not be sufficient to restore full 
functionality. in this review, we focus on studies of treatment 
with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) combined with cell 
implantation, neurotrophic factors, neuroprotective agents, 
and myelin inhibitor antibodies. We first describe the effect 
and mechanism of ChABC treatment alone, and the viral 
vector delivery methods. Then we focus on combinational 
studies, especially the problems arising from the variability 
in SCi lesion models and their anatomical and behavioral 
readouts. Furthermore, in order to make clinically-relevant 
treatment designs, rehabilitation must be incorporated into 
the combination paradigm. in the last section, we discuss 
the topics of combination of rehabilitation with ChABC, 
and the possibility of using a consistent model for future 
combinational treatment experimental design.

Chondroitinase ABC: Mechanism of Action
Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are a major 
component of the normal CNS extracellular matrix (ECM) 
with diverse functional roles. After lesions, CSPGs are 
upregulated several-fold, peaking at between 10 to 14 days 
post-lesion[2]. Together with activated glial cells, the CSPGs 
form a dense layer of glial scar inhibitory to axon growth, 
and much of this inhibition is due to the activity of the 
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains[3]. in addition, CSPGs are 
major components of the perineuronal nets (PNNs), which 
are dense ECM structures that form around many neuronal 
cell bodies and dendrites late in development[4, 5].
in the spinal cord, PNNs surround ~30% of motoneurons 
in the ventral horn, 50% of large interneurons in the 
intermediate grey, and 20% of neurons in the dorsal horn[4], 
while in the brain they are particularly associated with 
inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. The PNNs in the visual 
cortex form in the second week of postnatal development, 
which coincides with closure of the critical period for visual 
functions[6]. Formation of these structures and the turning 
off of plasticity are triggered by impulse activity in neurons. 
Treatment with ChABC removes PNNs and reopens a 
window of CNS plasticity by promoting axon sprouting and 
the formation of new connections[7].
ChABC is a bacterial enzyme isolated from Proteus 
vulgaris[8]. it degrades CSPGs by cleaving the GAG chains 
into soluble disaccharides or tetrasaccharides, and leaves 
behind the core protein. This enzymatic digestion results in 
the release of bound growth factors from chondroitin sulfate 
GAG chains[9], and reduction of the glial scar neoepitope-
induced immune response[10]. Also, one of the digestion 
products, the chondroitin sulfate E-disaccharide, is growth-
promoting[11]. The enzyme remains active in vivo for 10 days 
after injection. in injured spinal cord, intraspinal injection 
of ChABC 1 mm above and 1 mm below the lesion causes 
extensive digestion by ChABC covering >5 mm around the 
lesion site rostro-caudally and 1.5 mm dorso-ventrally[12].
ChABC has been shown in many in vitro and in vivo 
models to be an effective treatment for improving axonal 
regeneration and sprouting, and for promoting functional 
recovery in acute and chronic SCi in various animal 
models[13-17]. in animal experiments, ChABC treatment 
allows some axons to regenerate through the lesion, and 
leads to an increased sprouting response in both lesioned 
and spared systems after SCi[18]. ChABC also digests the 
PNNs[19], and opens a window of plasticity which allows 
effective acquisition of motor skills with rehabilitation[12, 16]. 
importantly, none of the sprouting responses seen after 
ChABC treatment have led to increased pain sensitivity.
Viral Vector-mediated ChABC Delivery
Both lentiviral (LV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) 
vector tools have been developed to deliver ChABC into 
the mammalian CNS[20]. The ChABC gene of bacterial 
origin has been modified to enable the production of active 
chondroitinase by mammalian cells. injection of LV-ChABC 
into the cortex or spinal cord results in the secretion of 
active ChABC both locally and from long-distance axon 
projections, with activity persisting for >4 weeks, and AAV-
ChABC has an even longer active period. in SCi models, 
the same beneficial effects on damaged corticospinal axons 
as ChABC were observed in animals which received LV-
ChABC injection directly into the vicinity of a spinal cord lesion. 
Due to the advantages of a longer-lasting effect and ease of 
administration, LV- or AAV-ChABC may be considered as a 
substitute for ChABC in combinational studies.
Combinatorial Treatments with Cells, Growth Factors, 
Ion Channels, Myelin Inhibitor Blockers and ChABC
in moderate or severe SCi, a cavity is formed due to tissue 
loss. Implants used to refill the space include tissue bridges 
or cells such as Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing 
cells (oECs), neural progenitor cells, umbilical cord blood-
derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and induced 
pluripotent stem cells[21]. The main issues with this strategy 
are cell survival, differentiation, incorporation, and exit of 
regenerated axons from the caudal end of the transplant 
and re-enter into host tissue. Various experiments, 
summarized below and in Fig. 1B, have combined ChABC 
with cell implants and with neurotrophic factors to overcome 
these problems.
Schwann Cells, OECs and ChABC
First, in an in vitro model with Schwann cell/astrocyte co-
culture, degradation or inhibition of CSPGs by ChABC 
or xylosyltransferase-1, a DNA enzyme against GAG-
chain-initiating enzyme, allowed mixing of the two cell 
types[22], and indicated that ChABC treatment improves the

integration of cells implanted into the surrounding tissue by 
removing the CSPG barrier. This was followed by an in vivo 
SCi experiment with complete T8 transection, after which 
oECs or Schwann cells were implanted around or into the 
lesion, together with prolonged ChABC infusion for four 
weeks. These combinations significantly improved graft 
integration and axon regeneration across the lesion, as well 
as locomotor recovery compared to control or graft alone[21]. 
This finding was reproduced and additional histological 
investigation with retrograde tracing showed that axons 
regenerate across the cell bridge into the caudal spinal 
cord[23]. Bladder function was also studied in a thoracic 
transection model, using a similar treatment with Schwann 
cells, oECs and ChABC[24]. in the combined-treatment 
group, increased bladder size and decreased amount of 
disorganized smooth muscle fibers and collagen deposit 
were found in comparison to the control group.
Neurotrophins, Neural Progenitor Cells, and 
ChABC
in a clip-compression SCi model, a triple-combination 
study  was  performed  using  implanted  neural precursor 
cells, ChABC, and a cocktail of epidermal growth factor, 
fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth 
factor[25]. This study showed successful differentiation, 
migration and integration of neural precursor cells 
(principally into oligodendrocytes), increased GAP43 levels, 
and increased plasticity of the corticospinal tract (CST) and 
serotonergic axons. The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan 
(BBB) score was slightly improved two months after 
treatment, and a significant improvement in ladder-walking 
Fig. 1. Schematic depicting the conditions in the spinal cord after injury and strategies developed for treating SCI. A: Typical lesion site 
of a dorsal column crush injury. Axons retract a few hundred micrometers from the site and form retraction bulbs (black dots); in 
white mater, myelin inhibitory molecules (orange dots) prevent axons from sprouting or regeneration; around the lesion, activated 
astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursors upregulate the CSPG level and form a dense layer of glial scar, which inhibits the grow 
of regenerating axons through, or for implanted cells to integrate into host tissue. B: Several strategies improve spinal cord repair, 
including chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) treatment to degrade CSPGs in the glial scar, cell implantation to reconnect the circuitry 
or provide a tissue bridge for axons to grow through (green spheres), ion channel expression to re-establish neuronal activity to 
that of the juvenile state (blue dots), and anti-Nogo treatment to block myelin inhibitors. Combinations of these strategies increase 
axon regeneration and plasticity, as well as re-connection of the circuitry (functional synapses represented by red dots), and 
improve cell implant survival and integration into host tissue.

was only found in the group receiving the combination 
treatment. A later study combined precursor cells, polymer 
scaffolds, neurotrophin-3 (NT3), and ChABC in a rat 
hemisection model. Locomotor recovery and motor-evoked 
potentials following transcranial magnetic stimulation were 
recorded only in the combination group[26]. Sensitivity tests 
showed that the treatment did not lead to aberrant sensory 
responses or post-traumatic neuropathic pain in these 
experiments.
in addition, the combination of NT3 and cell implantation 
with ChABC improved ascending sensory tract regeneration 
to the targets in the dorsal column nuclei (DCN) after SCi. 
Sensory neurons implanted between the SCi site and 
DCN two weeks after injury were able to grow in the white 
matter tract, but unable to enter the DCN. This problem 
was partially resolved by ChABC or NT3 alone, but the 
combination significantly increased the number of axons 
entering the target region in the brain stem[27].
Neuroprotective/conditioning Agents and ChABC
Another approach combined the inflammation-inducing 
preparation Zymosan and ChABC. in a dorsal root injury 
model, introducing the conditioning agent to the ganglia 
before injury, combined with ChABC-induced modification 
of CSPGs in the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), resulted in 
robust regeneration of sensory axons through the DREZ. 
Functional connectivity was confirmed by electrophysiology. 
However, the conditioning strategy only worked when 
applied before, but not after injury[28]. in the same lesion 
model, the neural regeneration effect of oncomodulin, 
a Ca2+-binding protein was tested in combination with 
cAMP and ChABC. The combination resulted in increased 
regeneration of sensory nerves into the DREZ, but the 
effect was extremely limited compared to Zymosan[29].
Another approach combined ChABC and clenbuterol, 
a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist that has neuroprotective 
effects, conducted by Bai et al. [30]. in adult rats with 
complete transection at T10, ChABC was applied acutely 
and clenbuterol was supplied in the drinking water. ChABC 
treatment decreased both CSPG and collagen deposition 
and reduced the gap between intact regions. Activated 
cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was found 
in retrograde tracing-labeled neurons, which regenerated 
axons through the lesion site. Recovery of locomotor 
function was observed 2 to 3 months after the lesion and 
was enhanced in the combined group[30].
ChABC and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
Receptor Type
Previous work has shown that plasticity in motoneurons is 
increased in the presence of NT3, and the NMDA receptor 
reverts to an immature type by expressing the NR2D 
subunit. in a lateral T8 hemisection SCi model, elevating 
the spinal levels of NT3 while increasing expression of the 
NR2D subunit of the NMDA receptor was combined with 
ChABC. The most axonal sprouting and best behavioral 
recovery in the BBB locomotor test was seen in the full 
combination group, and electrical conductivity across 
the lesion was only reestablished in rats receiving the 
combination. This treatment did not cause hypersensitivity 
in any group[31, 32].
ChABC and Blocking Myelin Inhibitors
Myelin and myelin debris contain several myelin-associated 
molecules that inhibit regeneration[33-35], among which 
the Nogo-A N-terminal region (amino-Nogo-A) is one of 
the most potent inhibitors. inhibition of Nogo-A increases 
axon plasticity and regeneration and improves functional 
recovery[36-38]. in a recent study, the effectiveness of a 
combination of α-Nogo-A, ChABC and rehabilitation was 
tested in a cervical dorsal column crush model[39]. The 
combination treatment applied α-Nogo-A antibody acutely, 
followed by delayed ChABC treatment starting at 3 weeks 
after injury, and rehabilitation starting at 4 weeks, to 
accommodate the requirement that α-Nogo-A be applied 
acutely, and that rehabilitation be given after the cessation 
of α-Nogo-A treatment. Using a CST-dependent skill 
(paw-reaching staircase task) as the main readout, single 
treatment with α-Nogo-A or ChABC and rehabilitation 
training improved functional recovery to a similar extent. 
The combination treatment was more effective; after 
treatment and 3 months of training, the combination 
group recovered to 80% of the level before the lesion. 
Anatomically, single treatments increased sprouting and 
axon regeneration, but combination treatment produced 
greater increases. α-Nogo-A stimulated growth of a greater 
number of axons with diameters >3 µm, while ChABC 
treatment stimulated increased growth of finer axons with 
varicosities. These results point to different functions of 
Nogo-A and CSPGs for axonal regeneration.
Due to its scar-degrading and plasticity-promoting 
properties, a combination of chABC and other treatment 
Rong-Rong Zhao, et al.    Combination treatment with ChABC in SCi—breaking the barrier 481
strategies including Nogo-A blocking, increasing cAMP, 
inserting ion channels, and cell implantation have 
synergistic effects in both acute and delayed SCi models. 
The combination tends to increase cell survival and 
incorporation into host tissue, and reestablishes circuit 
connectivity and functional recovery without causing 
abnormal sensitivity.
Combination of Regenerative Treatments with 
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation is an integral part of SCi management; 
any potential future interventions will almost certainly 
have to be compatible with rehabilitation. it is therefore 
important to study the treatment effects of regenerative 
treatments in combination with rehabilitation. ChABC 
opens a window of plasticity and has proven effective 
when specific rehabilitation is given during the period of 
drug administration, in both acute and delayed stages 
and up to one year post-injury in two SCi models[16, 31]. 
When combined with other treatments however, the timing 
between treatments and rehabilitation may influence the 
functional recovery. For example, α-Nogo-A treatment 
gives better results when the rehabilitation starts after the 
treatment period, rather than simultaneously[40, 41]. When 
combined with ChABC and rehabilitation immediately after 
the lesion, although significantly increased axonal plasticity 
occurs, functional recovery is insignificant (unpublished 
data). instead, when the ChABC is delayed for one week, 
and rehabilitation is started two weeks after completion 
of α-Nogo-A treatment, the treatment paradigm has a 
significant synergistic effect[39], indicating a significant role 
of timing in treatment planning.
Discussion and Perspective
After injury, tissue repair in the spinal cord faces challenges 
from both a limited ability for intrinsic growth and the 
presence of multiple inhibitory molecules in the surrounding 
tissue. in order to reach the goal of functional recovery, 
SCi treatment must address all these issues by combining 
multiple interventions. Research in this direction has 
provided promising results. However, due to the complexity 
and highly-variable nature of in vivo experiments, they 
normally require a large input of resources, so it is 
especially important for researchers to carefully design 
experiment taking into consideration the lesion model, 
types of readout, and the timing of medical intervention in 
relation to the lesion, to rehabilitation training, and to each 
other. 
The outcome of studies depends greatly on the animal 
model used. Many studies use the thoracic SCi model, 
and the BBB test as the readout for functional locomotor 
recovery. Locomotion is one of the most important 
functions, and the BBB score is widely accepted as a good 
measure. However, as the therapeutic power grows, more 
‘demanding’ behavioral tests will be necessary to assess 
the level of recovery in a way that might predict therapeutic 
efficacy in humans. A battery of behavioral tests has been 
developed in the past decades to study movement function 
after SCi. Kinematic analysis gives detailed information 
about locomotor control, and software tools are available to 
quantify limb movements[42, 43].
However, humans depend heavily on supraspinal 
input, particularly from the CST for motor control. Animal 
models which test supraspinal inputs may therefore be 
more clinically relevant. The CST has been a focus for both 
axon regeneration, and more recently for behavioral tests. 
in rodents, the main function of the CST is skilled paw 
function, which can provide a high-resolution model. Tests 
include the skilled paw-reaching staircase task[44-46], pasta 
handling[47], single-pellet retrieval[48, 49], ladder walking[50, 51], 
skilled walking and swimming[52, 53].
In vivo combinational studies are major undertakings. 
introducing each additional treatment into a combinational 
paradigm adds an extra parameter, which in theory 
doubles the number of experimental groups and total 
number of animals. As a result, the scale of an experiment 
quickly becomes impractical unless a large group of 
researchers is involved. in order for the results from these 
large experiments to be comparable, it is important that 
standardized protocols for behavioral analysis, histological 
analysis and data processing are used.
