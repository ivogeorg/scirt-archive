as shown by the presence of neurons stained by retrograde tracing in the brainstem nuclei. A
larger number of 5-HT positive fibers were found in the cranial stump of the OLP and RLP
groups compared to the lesion and caudal regions. Calcitonin gene-related peptide fibers
were present in considerable numbers at the SCI site in both types of transplantation. Our
results failed to verify differences between acute, 2-week and 4-week delayed transplantation
of OLP and RLP, suggesting that the limited functional and axon reparative effects observed
could not be exclusively related to OECs. A greater understanding of the effects of these tissue
grafts is necessary to strengthen the rationale for application of this treatment in humans.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) has very poor clinical prospects, resulting in irreversible loss of
function below the injury site. Although applied in clinical trials, olfactory ensheathing cells
transplantation (OEC) derived from lamina propria (OLP) is still a controversial repair
strategy. The present study explored the efficacy of OLP or respiratory lamina propria (RLP)
transplantation and the optimum period after SCI for application of this potential therapy.
Adult male rats were submitted to spinal cord transection and underwent acute, 2-week or
4-week post-injury transplantation with pieces of OLP (containing OECs) or RLP (without
OECs). After grafting, animals with OLP and RLP showed discrete and similar hindlimb motor
improvement, with comparable spinal cord tissue sparing and sprouting in the lesion area.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in loss of central control ofmotor,
sensorial, and autonomic functions below the site of injury (van
den Berg et al., 2010). Despite the application of neuroprotective
treatments, such as methylprednisolone or interleukin-10, the
clinical prospects for spinal cord lesions are currently very
poor (Fitch and Silver, 2008; Takami et al., 2002b). Functional dis-
abilities occur due to local neuronal death and loss of ascending
anddescending axons in the spinal cord, either by direct trauma
or secondary damage (Hausmann, 2003; Ramer et al., 2005).The
hostile environment produced by glial scarring, the presence of
inhibitory molecules associated with oligodendrocyte myelin
and inadequate neurotrophin supply are responsible for im-
paired regeneration of severed axons after SCI (Franssen et al.,
2007).
In attempts to provide a cellular milieu appropriate for axo-
nal regrowth and the restoration of lost neural circuits, several
primary cell types have been used in transplantations into the
SCI site (Kwon and Tetzlaff, 2001; Tetzlaff et al., 2011). The olfac-
tory system has attracted considerable interest as a promising
sourceof cells for transplantation after SCI, because of its capac-
ity for lifelong regeneration (Lindsay et al., 2010). The main
focus of attention in the olfactory tissue has been a unique
type of glia, known as the olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs)
(Doucette, 1991; Raisman, 2001; Ramón-Cueto and Muñoz-
Quiles, 2011). These cells reside within the two main regions
of the olfactory axis: peripherally, in the lamina propria and
centrally, along the nerve fiber layer of the olfactory bulb (OB)
(Au andRoskams, 2003). TheOECs are responsible formaintain-
ing an environment which favors neurite outgrowth and the
creation of new functional synapses in the central nervous sys-
tem (Au and Roskams, 2003; Franssen et al., 2007).
Due to their supposed axon regenerative properties, OECs
have been extensively studied in animalmodels of SCI. Although
some research has shown locomotor and axonal regeneration
improvements, a consensus on the efficacy of this cellular trans-
plantation andmode of action has yet to be reached (Barnett and
Riddell, 2007; Boyd et al., 2004; Franssen et al., 2008; Kubasak et
al., 2008; Raisman and Li, 2007; Ramón-Cueto and Avila, 1998;
Ramón-Cueto et al., 1998, 2000; Tetzlaff et al., 2011). The source
ofOECs for transplantation into injured spinal cord is also subject
of debate (Richter et al., 2005). However, the use of olfactory lam-
inapropria (OLP) grafts,which is amoreaccessible sourceofOECs
in humans, could enable a safer approach for autologous trans-
plantation (Bianco et al., 2004; Féron et al., 1998; Franklin, 2002).
The devastating prognosis associated with the social and
economic impacts, has led to increased efforts to find thera-
pies that provide functional recovery for people who undergo
severe SCI (Blight, 2002; van den Berg et al., 2010). According to
previous studies, the use of OLP transplantation is a promis-
ing, though controversial, repair strategy (Lu et al., 2001,
2002; Steward et al., 2006). In the present study we hypothe-
sized that the OECs present in OLP grafts could create a favor-

propria (RLP), which is a graft devoid of OECs. Additionally,controls, the AC and 4WDC groups (303.1±77.3; 414.8±96.4,
respectively). The 2-week delayed transplantation of both
lamina propria grafts seems to promote similar spinal tissue
sparing levels (450.9±123.2; 478.6±120.9 respectively) (Fig. 2A).
The presence of sprouting axons was indicated by growth
associated protein-43 (GAP-43) immunoreactivity at the SCIwe tested the efficacy of OLP transplantation in three different
therapeutic windows (acutely, 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-
injury), since another key aspect in the translation of this
therapy to clinical practice is their potential to produce axonal
regeneration even when transplantation is delayed after SCI.
2. Results
2.1. Hindlimb motor function
Fig. 1 illustrates average Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale
scores (BBB) before and across the post-injury survival interval
for the experimental groups. Prior to the injury (naive test), no
differences were observed in the average of inter-group BBB
scores and the animals showed normal locomotor activity
(scored as 21). By contrast, at 5 days post-injury (test 1) there
was a complete flaccid paralysis of both hindlimbs movements
in most animals and BBB scores were 0.21±0.09 for the acute
control group (AC), 0.23±0.16 for the acute treated group (AT),
0.18±0.09 for the 2-week delayed control group (2WDC), 0.21±
0.09 for the 2-week delayed treated group (2WDT), 0.16±0.09
for the 4-week control group (4WDC), 0.41±0.37 for the 4-week
treated group (4WDT) (mean±SEM). Instead of the slight recov-
ery of motor skills observed from 20 days after SCI to the end of
this study, there were no differences between the average BBB
scores obtained at any time point comparing acute, 2-week or
4-week OLP transplanted groups with their respective RLP con-
trol groups (one-way repeated measures ANOVA; acute groups
F(1,20)=0.13, p>0.05; 2-week delayed groups F(1,22)=1.66, p>0.05;
4-week delayed groups F(1,22)=0.11, p>0.05). In the last function-
al test, the BBB scores were 3.5±0.9 for the AC group; 2.7±0.5 for
theATgroup; 2.6±0.4 for the 2WDCgroup; 3.0±0.6 for the 2WDT
group; 2.6±0.6 for the 4WDC group and 2.0±0.4 for the 4WDT
group. No differences were found when data from the last
functional test were compared between all the studied groups
(one-way ANOVA F(5,65)=0.57, p>0.05).
2.2. Spinal tissue sparing and sprouting
Analysis of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunore-
active sections revealed a variation in themorphology of the le-
sion sites among the experimental groups: some rats displayed
transparent cavities that separated their spinal cord stumps,
while others contained smaller cavities. The preserved tissue
area, determined by the presence of healthy looking cells and
GFAP immunoreactivity, was measured to quantify the repair
effects produced by OLP or RLP transplantation. Although no
significant differences were found between the groups (one-
way ANOVA F(5,21)=0.75, p>0.05), the AT and 4WDT groups
presented higher levels of spinal tissue sparing (488.7±101.1;
552 6 ( 2 0 1 1 ) 5 4 – 7 2site of the groups (AC—0.1±0.0; AT—0.2±0.0; 2WDC—0.1±
0.0; 2WDT—0.1±0.0; 4WDC—0.1±0.0; 4WDT—0.2±0.0). The
1 456 B R A I N R E S E A R C Hoptical densitometry for this protein showed no differences
when comparing acute, 2-week or 4-week OLP transplanted
groups with their respective RLP controls (one-way ANOVA
F(5,25)=0.64, p>0.05) (Figs. 2B, C, D).
2.3. Retrograde tracer labeled cells
Few fluorogold (FG) positive neurons were found in the brain
areas of the animals that received OLP and RLP transplantation
(Table 1). The observed labeled cell bodies were comparable in
size and appeared in clusters, as previously described by Vavrek
et al. (2007).
The primary and secondary motor cortices (M1/M2) did not
exhibit labeled neurons in any groups. Only one animal, from
theAC group, was found to have FG-positive neurons in the pri-
mary somatosensory cortex (S1). In the brainstem, animals
from the AC group showed labeled neurons in the spinal

from the AT group exhibited FG-positive neurons in the dorsal

(Ra), SpVe, LVe and PnO/PnC nuclei. In the 2-week delayed
groups, FG-labeled neurons were observed in the LVe nuclei of
the 2WDC group and in the PnO/PnC of the 2WDT group. The
4WDC group exhibited few FG-positive neurons in the LVe nu-
clei, while no labeled neurons were observed in any studied
areas of the 4WDT group (Table 1).

of slices analyzed, no 5-HT labeled axons were found in the
caudal stump (AC—0.00±0.0; AT—0.00±0.0; 2WDC—0.01±0.0;
2WDT—0.01±0.0; 4WDC—0.00±0.0; 4WDT—0.00±0.0) (Figs. 3,

of the rostral, lesion and caudal regions of spinal cord when
all groups were compared (Kruskal–Wallis p=0.37; p=0.73;
p=0.34, respectively) (Fig. 6).
As expected, ascending sensory fibers immunostained by
CGRP were detected in the caudal stump of the experimental
groups (AC—1.27±0.3; AT—1.08±0.3; 2WDC—1.42±0.6; 2WDT
—1.42±0.8; 4WDC—0.87±0.2; 4WDT—1.10±0.2). There were
considerable levels of CGRP fibers in the lesion region (AC—

4WDC—0.85±0.2; 4WDT—1.75±0.5), showing that both OLP
and RLP transplantation stimulated the growth/sprouting

in the rostral, lesion and caudal regions of the spinal cord
were observed comparing the groups (Kruskal–Wallis p=0.97;
p=0.25; p=0.90, respectively) (Fig. 6).
3. Discussion
The hindlimbmotor recovery and axonal growth-promoting ef-
fects of OECs, OLP and olfactory mucosa have been studied in
different models of spinal cord lesions (see Table 2). In the pre-
sent study, we have investigated and compared the restorative
efficiency of OLP and RLP transplants, in three different thera-
peutic windows (acutely, 2-week and 4-week delayed), after a
complete thoracic spinal cord transection in adult rats. By the
twelfth week after transplantation, animals with OLP or RLP
showed a discrete and similar hindlimb motor improvement.
All transplants produced comparable results for spinal cord tis-
sue sparing and sprouting, evaluated using GFAP and GAP-43
animals submitted to spinal cord transection and olfactory or

tracing in brainstem nuclei. However, retrogradely labeled cells
in cortical areas were only observed following acute RLP trans-
plantation. A larger number of 5-HT positive fibers were found
in the cranial stump of the OLP and RLP groups compared to
the lesion and caudal regions analyzed. CGRP fibers were pre-
sent in considerable number at the SCI site in both transplanta-
tion types.
Although the mechanisms underlying the regenerative
properties of OECs in the SCI site are not completely eluci-
dated, reduction of glial scarring (Lu et al., 2006), facilitation
of axon re-entry into the host–graft interface (Li et al., 2005),
reduction of proteoglycan expression (García-Alías et al.,
2004), angiogenesis (Richter et al., 2005), remyelination
(Sasaki et al., 2006) and growth-factors release (Lipson et
al., 2003) are considered the main benefits of this cell trans-
plantation (Tetzlaff et al., 2011). We were able to detect the
presence of OECs in the lamina propria before and after
grafting in the transection site, but the limitations of our
study were the lack of the OECs quantification and the in-
ability to investigate the possible migratory properties of
these cells after transplantation. Nevertheless, some as-
pects of OECs behavior after transplantation have been pre-
viously documented. In an olfactory nerve injury, OECs
were seen to remain at the lesion site forming a conduit
that can guide regenerating nerve axons, analogously to
Schwann cells after a peripheral nerve injury (Li et al.,
2005; Williams et al., 2004). After a cervical spinal cord inju-

(2005) showed a superior migratory ability of OECs derived
from lamina propria when compared to OECs derived from
OB after crush of spinal cord dorsolateral funiculus at
the C3–C4 level. Thus, the migratory capacity of these cells
after transplantation into different injury sites is still
controversial.
OLP transplants have the dual advantage of providing a
physical bridge that could mechanically favor axonal sprouting
aswell as being a reservoir of OECs (Lu et al., 2002). RLP provides
the same bridging function and shares many of the cell types
with OLP (olfactory nerve bundles, trigeminal nerve fibers,
Schwann cells, endothelium, interstitial fibroblasts and tissue
resident immune cells) (Mackay-Sim and St John, 2011). These
shared cells present in RLP may have been responsible for the
hindlimb motor improvement and the CGRP regeneration ob-
served at the lesion site (Lindsay et al., 2010). On the other
hand, the restoration of a cell continuum alone within the spi-
nal cord may have largely contributed to the results found
with both transplant types. According to this latter hypothesis,
animals in which 4 mm were removed from spinal cord and
with a matrigel only-bridge showed BBB scores comparable to
those observed in the RLP groups. In the animals transplanted
with matrigel, myelinated axons were exhibited in the injury
site, with 5-HT positive fibers crossing the lesion and penetrat-
ing the caudal stump (Fouad et al., 2005). In another similar
study, alginate-based capillary gels were inserted after transec-
tion of the dorsal column at the C3 level. Similarly, a robust
growth of coerulospinal projections and GAP-43 positive fibers
was shown within the hydrogel (Prang et al., 2006). However,
animals submitted to spinal cord transection and injections of
culture medium only (without any bridge at the lesion), also
obtained BBB scores that were very close to those observed
with our OLP/RLP grafts. Many GAP-43-immunoreactive axons
were found in the stumps of these culture-medium-injected
group and some CGRP-positive axons invaded the lesion epi-
center (López-Vales et al., 2006). In the present study, a lesion-
only control group was not included in order to avoid the use
of a large number of animals. Moreover, animals without any
type of transplantation would not develop the immune re-
sponses present in the other groups submitted to heterologous
tissue transplantation. More studies are required to verify
whether comparable outcomes reported in this study could be
found in either untreated or matrigel-only bridge groups, in
order to elucidate the possible positive effects exerted by cells
other thanOECs present in theRLP after spinal cord transection.
Previous studies have emphasized the importance of an
appropriate post-injury period for repair after SCI (Schiwy et
al., 2009; Takami et al., 2002a). Most experimental studies
only performed OECs or tissue transplants acutely (Guest et
al., 2008; Kubasak et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2001; Ramón-Cueto
and Avila, 1998; Ramón-Cueto et al., 2000). However, trans-
plantation of purified OECs or lamina propria after SCI in
humans implies delayed grafting (Tetzlaff et al., 2011). The re-
lease of cytotoxic metabolites derived from hemorrhage and/
or inflammation could be prevented by more acute interven-
tions, but this procedure could be harmful to the transplanted
cells at an intermediate stage (Deumens et al., 2006; Martin et
B R A I N R E S E A R C Hal., 1996). Lu et al. (2001, 2002) showed a great improvement in
hindlimb motor function, spinal reflex and enhanced2 weeks or 4 weeks post-injury). Raphespinal axons rarely ex-
tended beyond the lesion border, but CGRP fibers were evident
in the center of the lesion after both types of transplants.
Thus, the optimal time-window for cellular or tissue trans-
plantation continues to be ill-defined, but this parameter
does not seem to limit the effects obtained from the grafts.
In addition, as CGRP axon regenerationmay be related to noci-
ception transmission, interventions that favor axonal regen-
eration after SCI must be controlled to ensure that
appropriate rather than inappropriate connections are re-
stored (Richter et al., 2005).
Despite current controversy in animal studies, clinical tri-
als using cultured OECs from lamina propria or olfactory mu-
cosa grafts have been made in chronically injured humans
(Chhabra et al., 2009; Féron et al., 2005; Lima et al., 2006,
2010; Mackay-Sim et al., 2008). There is still divergence regard-
ing the functional results and, moreover, the procedures used
in some of these studies were not administered according to
formal clinical trial protocols (Mackay-Sim and St John, 2011).
3.1. Conclusions
Acute, 2-week or 4-week delayed OLP and RLP transplantation
produced a discrete functional recovery over time and compa-
rable CGRP fiber sprouting in the lesion site, but failed to
produce regeneration of raphespinal descendent fibers. OECs
are only one cell type found in olfactory mucosa, which is a
tissue of considerable cellular complexity. This is particularly
relevant when clinical trials involving the transplantation of
these tissue samples in a complex injury such as the damaged
central nervous system are conducted (Lindsay et al., 2010). A
better understanding of the effects of OLP and RLP transplan-
tation in SCI animal models is necessary in order to strength-
en the rationale for the application of this treatment in
humans. Additionally, cells transplants combined with other
therapies, such as the administration of MAG, OMP and
NOGO-A inhibitors, growth-factors, and/or treadmill step
training may increase the possible beneficial results after spi-
nal cord injury.
4. Experimental procedure
4.1. General
Experimental procedures were approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande
do Sul (No. 2007892). The animals were cared for in accor-
dance with Arouca Brazilian law (11794/2008) and the Nation-regeneration of raphespinal fibers with OLP transplantation
immediately or 4 weeks after spinal cord transection. On the
other hand, Steward et al. (2006) failed to find evidence of
functional recovery and showed only limited regeneration of
raphespinal axons after spinal cord transection and 4-week
delayed OLP transplantation. In our study, functional recov-
ery, tissue sparing and axon sprouting/regeneration outcomes
were comparable between animals with OLP or RLP grafts,

animal handling recommendations of the Brazilian Society for
Neurosciences and the International Brain Research Organi-
zation were also followed.
A total of 108 maleWistar rats (local breeding colony), 280–
380 g in body weight, and 13 weeks old were used in this
study. Groups of two or three animals were maintained in
standard plexigas boxes (46×24×15 cm), under 12:12 h light/
dark cycle, in a temperature controlled environment (20±
2 °C) with food and water ad libitum. The animals were tested
4.3. Post-operative care
Animals received the analgesic Dimorph (morphine sulfate
s.c., 0.08–0.16 mg/kg, Cristália, São Paulo—SP, Brazil) twice a
day, during the first 4 days post-injury. Rats were also treated
prophylactically with Baytril (Enrofloxacin, s.c., 2.5 mg/kg
Bayer, São Paulo—SP, Brazil) to prevent urinary tract infec
tions for 14 days. Bladders were manually expressed twice a
day until it was no longer distended and palpable, indicating

Initially, animals were separated in experimental animals
(n=72) and lamina propria donors (n=36). Experimental ani-
mals (n=72) were again randomly divided into six groups: (1)
AC—rats submitted to RLP transplantation, immediately
after spinal cord transection (n=11); (2) AT—rats submitted
to OLP transplantation, immediately after spinal cord transec-
tion (n=12); (3) 2WDC—rats submitted to RLP transplantation,
two weeks after spinal cord transection (n=12); (4) 2WDT—rats
submitted to OLP transplantation, two weeks after spinal cord
transection (n=12); (5) 4WDC—rats submitted to RLP trans-
plantation, four weeks after spinal cord transection (n=12);
(6) 4WDT—rats submitted to OLP transplantation, four weeks
after spinal cord transection (n=12). All efforts were made to
minimize the number of animals studied and their suffering.
Thus, similarly to a previous studies, a lesion-only group
(i.e., without any type of transplantation) was not included
(Lu et al., 2001, 2002; Steward et al., 2006).
4.2. Spinal cord transection
For spinal cord transection procedure, animals were anesthe-
tized using pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, i.p., Cristália, São Paulo—
SP, Brazil) and maintained on a heating pad. The hair overly-
ing the area of interest was shaved and the skin was cleaned.
A midline incision in the thoracic area was made and muscle/
connective tissues were dissected to expose the T8-T9 verte-
brae. After a laminectomy, the spinal cord was transected at
two levels using microscissors (approximately 2–3 mm
apart). The segment between these incisions was removed,
leaving a gap (Fig. 7A, left). To ensure completeness of the le-
sion, the spinal cord stumps were lifted, placed back into the
vertebral canal and a curved needle was passed through the
lateral extension of vertebral canal at lesion center (Ilha et
al., 2011; Ramón-Cueto et al., 2000). A piece of hemostatic
sponge (Technew, São Paulo—SP, Brazil) was placed on the
transection site, and then muscles, connective tissue and
skin were sutured. The animals were gently warmed until
recovery.

reflex (15–20 days). Animals were daily monitored for infec-
tions and general health throughout the post-injury survival
period. Animals did not exhibit autophagia during the experi-
mental period.
4.4. Dissection and lamina propria preparation
OLP and RLP were dissected according to the method de-
scribed by Steward et al. (2006). Donors male Wistar rats
(n=36), 280–380 g in body weight and 13 weeks old, were de-
capitated. The head was bisected just off the midline in such
a way as to allow visualization of the nasal septum and OB.
The nasal septum was removed using microscissors and
placed in a Petri dish containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
Medium/Ham's Nutrient Mixture F12 tissue culture media
(DMEN/F12, Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
Olfactory mucosa bilaterally lines the posterior part of the
nasal septum and its lamina propria contains OECs. Fig. 8A
shows a coronal section of the olfactory mucosa, with the
olfactory epithelium and OECs in lamina propria. These fusi-
form glial cells were identified by their immunoreactivity for
p75 neurotrophin receptor (rabbit anti-p75NTR, 1:300, Sigma-
Aldrich, USA, N3908), S-100 (rabbit anti-S-100, 1:600, Sigma-
Aldrich, USA, S2644) and GFAP in low intensity (mouse
anti-GFAP, 1:400, Sigma-Aldrich, USA, G3893) (Ramer et al.,
2004; Ramón-Cueto and Avila, 1998).
Respiratory mucosa is thinner than olfactory mucosa and
bilaterally covers the dorso-anterior part of the nasal septum.
As shown in Fig. 8B, RLP is devoid of OECs. However, p75, S-
100 and GFAP markers alone are not exclusive to these glial
cells and the staining observed in RLP could be related to the
presence of Schwann cells from the trigeminal nerve
(Mackay-Sim and St John, 2011).
Using a scalpel, two similar sized pieces of olfactory or re-
spiratory mucosa were dissected from the donor's nasal sep-
tum and immediately placed in ice-cold DMEN/F12. In the
respiratory tissue dissection, the vomeronasal nerve was
avoided. Olfactory and respiratory tissues were separately in-
(red) and GFAP (green) at approximately 18 weeks post-injury.

4.5. Transplantation of OLP and RLP
The acute animal groups were transplanted immediately after
spinal cord transection with RLP (AC group) or OLP (AT group).
The other animal groups received RLP and OLP grafts 2 weeks
post-SCI (2WDC and 2WDT groups, respectively) and 4 weeks
post-SCI (4WDC and 4WDT groups, respectively). For this pro-
cedure, rats were re-anesthetized (as described above) and the
original incision was re-opened. Scar tissue was removed and
the gap between the rostral and caudal stumps was filled with
pieces of respiratory (2WDC and 4WDC groups) or olfactory
(2WDT and 4WDT groups) lamina propria (Fig. 7A, right). A
piece of hemostatic sponge (Hemospon, Technew, São Paulo
—SP, Brazil) was placed over the transplantation site to ensure
blood homeostasis. Again, muscle and skin layers were su-
tured and post-operatory care was maintained as previously
described.
Approximately 18 weeks after spinal cord injury, the viabil-
ity of grafted tissue was demonstrated by the presence of
fusiform-shaped OECs immunoreactive for p75NTR, S-100
and GFAP at the site of spinal cord transection (Fig. 8C). RLP
control grafts continued to be devoid of OECs, as confirmed
by the lack of cells expressing the three markers used in the
lesion area (Fig. 8D).
4.6. Behavioral assessment
Hindlimbmotor function was assessed using the BBB locomo-
tor rating (Basso et al., 1996). This scale is qualitative, widely
used and designated to assess the functional recovery of hin-
dlimbs after lesions in thoracic spinal cord. The score of this
scale ranges from 0 (no hindlimb movement) to 21 (normal
movement of the hindlimbs). In this study, BBB assessment
was accomplished preoperatively (naive) and postoperatively
after the SCI (at days 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80 post-injury for the
AC and AT groups; at days 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95 post-injury
for the 2WDC and 2WDT groups; and at days 5, 20, 35, 50, 65,
80, 95, 110 post-injury for the 4WDC and 4WDT groups). For
each test, rats were placed in an open-field (60×30×40 cm)
for 5 min. The test session was recorded with a video camera
(Sony Handycam DCR-SR88, São Paulo—SP, Brazil) to allow
later analysis by a blinded observer. The scores of the left
and right hindlimbs were averaged and taken as the BBB
score of each animal.
4.7. Retrograde tracer injection
At the end of behavioral analysis, rats were anesthetized as
described above. An incision was made at the T12 vertebrae
level to expose the spinal cord below the SCI site. After a lami-
nectomy, FG retrograde tracer (2% dextran tetramethylener-
hodamine, Biotium Inc., Hayward—CA, USA) was injected
using a stereotaxic apparatus (Insight, Ribeirão Preto—SP, Bra-
zil) coupled to a 1 μL Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company,
Reno—NV, USA). Three injections of FG (0.05 μL, 1 min dura-
64 B R A I N R E S E A R C Htion each) were made at midline (0.5, 0.8 and 1.5 mm deep)
and 1 mm laterally (0.5, 0.8 and 1.2 mm deep) in each side ofthis spinal cord level (Steward et al., 2006). Post-operatory
care was done as previously described.
4.8. Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry
One week after the retrograde tracing injections, rats received
an overdose of pentobarbital (100mg/kg body weight, i.p., Cris-
tália, São Paulo—SP, Brazil) and were transcardially perfused
with saline solution and buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH
7.4) using a peristaltic pump (30 mL/min, Milan Equipamentos
Científicos, Colombo—PR, Brazil). Brain, brainstem and thoracic
spinal cord with approximately 2-cm long (including the lesion
site) were removed, post-fixed in the same fixative solution and
cryoprotected in 15% and 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer
saline (PBS). Prior to embedding in Tissue-Tek, spinal cord sam-
pleswere photographedwith a digital camera (Sony Cyber-Shot
DSC-S950, São Paulo—SP, Brazil) on a dark background to
provide morphological visualization of the injury site (Fig. 7B).
After this, samples were quickly frozen in isopentane (Merck,
Germany) cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.
Primary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary
motor cortex and the entire brainstem were serially sliced
(200 μm thick, 150 μm apart) using a cryostat (CM1850, Leica,
São Paulo—SP, Brazil) to allow retrograde tracer visualization.
These sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides,
covered with aqueous mounting medium (FluorSave, Calbio-
chem, Darmstadt, Germany) and coverslips. The entire spinal
cord samples were longitudinally cut (25 μm), in a series of 5
slides per animal with 7–8 sections per slide. Two slides per
animal were used to perform immunohistochemistry by the
peroxidase method (Sternberger, 1979). Initially, sections
were washed in PBS, followed by a 30 min period with 3%
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). After several washes in PBS, sec-
tions were pre-incubated in 1% albumin solution with 0.4%
triton X-100 (PBS-Tx). Then, slices were incubated for 48 h at
4 °C in either GFAP (rabbit anti-GFAP, 1:200, DAKO Denmark
A/S, Denmark, Z0334) or GAP-43 antibodies (mouse anti-GAP-
43, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., USA, SC33705). Sec-
tions were rinsed in PBS-Tx and re-incubated in goat anti-
rabbit IgG (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich, USA, R2004) or goat anti-
mouse IgG (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich, USA, M8642) for 2 h. Follow-
ing PBS washes, slices were placed in peroxidase anti-
peroxidase (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, USA, P1291) for 1 h and
30 min. The immunohistochemical reaction was developed
by incubating the slices in a medium containing 0.06% 3,3 dia-
minobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich, USA, D5637) and then in
the same solution containing 1 μM of 3% H2O2 per mL of DAB
medium for 10 min each. Finally, slices were rinsed with
PBS, dehydrated with ethanol, cleared with xylene and cov-
ered with Permount and coverslips. Control sections were pre-
pared by omitting the primary antibody and replacing it with
PBS.
In double staining protocols, fibre tracts were stained using
the following antibodies: rabbit anti-serotonin (1:5000, Sigma-
Aldrich, USA, S5545) for serotonergic axons in the spinal cord
coming from raphe nuclei; and rabbit anti-CGRP (1:1500, cour-
tesy of Dr. Rodrigo, Instituto Cajal, Spain) as a marker for as-
cending sensory neurons. Fibrous scar borders were defined

with an Olympus confocal FV-1000. Plan-Apochromat 10× ob-
jective lens were used (Numerical aperture - NA 0.30) and the
pinhole was set in automatic mode. The FG signal (blue) was
visualized with a wide band ultraviolet excitation filter
(Excitation—331 nm, Emission—418 nm). Images were made
using a photomultiplier detector and all pictures were
analyzed with Image J Software 1.42q (Wayne Rasband, Na-
tional Institutes of Health, USA). The total number of FG la-
beled neurons in the propriospinal and selected supraspinal
regions, i.e., MdV/MdD (5 slices per animal on average), PnO/
PnC (7 slices per animal on average), Ra (including the raphe
pallidus, raphe obscurus, raphe magnus—20 slices per animal
on average), SpVe (7 slices per animal on average), LVe (6

proximately) and near the scar border of the rostral stump.
All images (on average, 19 pictures per spinal cord region in
ni's post hoc tests were conducted by comparing OLP trans-
1 4slices per animal on average), locus coeruleus (LC—4 slices per
animal on average), M1/M2 (25 slices per animal on average)
and S1 (20 slices per animal on average) was counted bilateral-
ly by a blinded observer (Iannotti et al., 2004; Xu et al., 1995).
Axons from these nuclei project to the thoracolumbar spinal
cord and play important roles in locomotor function (Holstege
and Kuypers, 1987; Iannotti et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2002). The
location and number of FG-stained cellular bodies were deter-
mined from each section using an overlaid grid and a stereo-
taxic atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 1998).
4.9.2. Spinal tissue sparing and GAP-43 optical densitometry
Images of diaminobenzidine-stained spinal cord sections
(20×) were taken using a Nikon Microscope Optiphot-2
(Japan) coupled to a CMOS camera (518 CU, Micrometrics)
and analyzed with Image J Software 1.42q. Subsequently, dig-
ital RGB (24-bit) images with resolution of 254×254 DPI were
converted to grayscale (8-bit) and corrected for unequal illu-
mination (shading correction). All lightning conditions and
magnifications were held constant.
To evaluate spinal tissue sparing, pictures of GFAP-
immunostained spinal cord sections were captured with the
lesion-part in the center. Samples with no continuity between
rostral and caudal stumps were discarded from this analysis.
After standardized background corrections, black-and-white
8-bit images were thresholded and tissue area fractions mea-
sured in each section. Since not all sections of the whole spi-
nal could be used for analysis, volume and total area
values of spinal cord tissue sparing could not be obtained.
On average, 5 images were analyzed from each rat and a
mean of spared tissue was calculated for experimental
group (6 animals each group) (adapted from Kubasak et al.,
2008).
Images of GAP-43 immunohistochemistry were also
obtained from the injured part of the spinal cord. After stan-
dardized background corrections, a mask of each spinal cord
section image was created using an auto-threshold tool from
Image J, hence avoiding vacuolization and interrupted tissue
integrity. Thereafter, optical densities (OD) of the images
were measured from whole injury regions within the area of
interest, i.e., the mask itself. OD was calculated using the fol-
lowing formula:
OD ¼ −log INT x; yð Þ–BLð Þ½ = INC–BLð Þ
Where “OD” is the optical density; “INT (x,y)” or intensity is
the intensity at pixel (x,y), “BL” or black is the intensity gener-
ated when no light goes through the material and “INC” is the
intensity of the incidental light.
Around 6–16 images were analyzed from each rat and 6 an-
imals were analyzed per group.
4.9.3. Axon profile quantification
5-HT and CGRP fiber populations were also identified using
a Nikon Microscope Optiphot-2 (Japan) with a green excita-
tion filter for the Alexa 555 signal (G-2A, Excitation—
510/560). Double-labeling with GFAP antibody was used to
delineate the fibrous scar borders and the signal for Alexa
70 B R A I N R E S E A R C H488 was detected using a blue excitation filter (B-2A, Excita-
tion—450/490). Pictures with resolution of 254×254 DPI,plantation with the corresponding RLP group. Regarding
assessment of spinal tissue sparing and regional optical den-
sitometry, all groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. The Kruskal–Wallis
test was used for axon profile data (5-HT or CGRP). Values
were run on SPSS 11.5 (Statistical Package for the Social Sci-
ences, Inc., USA).

4.10. Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as means±SEM. Open field locomotor
scores were analyzed between groups using analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with time as the repeated measure. When
there were statistically significant F values (p≤0.05), Bonferro-were taken at magnification of 200× using a CMOS camera
(518 CU, Micrometrics) and analyzed with Image J Software
1.42q. The total area occupied by 5-HT or CGRP axons was
determined separately in the rostral, lesion and caudal re-
gions, throughout the width of the tissue sections. To as-
sess 5-HT fibers, pictures were taken of the rostral stump
(in the region with abundant visible astrocytes), the central
part of the lesion (approximately) and near the scar border
of the caudal stump. Analogously, images of CGRP fibers
were taken of the caudal stump (in the region with abun-
dant visible astrocytes), in the central part of the lesion (ap-
