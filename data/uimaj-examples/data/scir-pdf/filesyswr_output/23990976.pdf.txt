Abstract
Despite limited regeneration capacity, partial injuries to the adult mammalian spinal cord can elicit variable degrees of
functional recovery, mediated at least in part by reorganization of neuronal circuitry. Underlying mechanisms are believed
to include synaptic plasticity and collateral sprouting of spared axons. Because plasticity is higher in young animals, we
developed a spinal cord compression (SCC) injury model in the neonatal mouse to gain insight into the potential for
reorganization during early life. The model provides a platform for high-throughput assessment of functional synaptic
connectivity that is also suitable for testing the functional integration of human stem and progenitor cell-derived neurons
being considered for clinical cell replacement strategies. SCC was generated at T9–T11 and functional recovery was assessed
using an integrated approach including video kinematics, histology, tract tracing, electrophysiology, and high-throughput
optical recording of descending inputs to identified spinal neurons. Dramatic degeneration of axons and synaptic contacts
was evident within 24 hours of SCC, and loss of neurons in the injured segment was evident for at least a month thereafter.
Initial hindlimb paralysis was paralleled by a loss of descending inputs to lumbar motoneurons. Within 4 days of SCC and
progressively thereafter, hindlimb motility began to be restored and descending inputs reappeared, but with examples of
atypical synaptic connections indicating a reorganization of circuitry. One to two weeks after SCC, hindlimb motility
approached sham control levels, and weight-bearing locomotion was virtually indistinguishable in SCC and sham control
mice. Genetically labeled human fetal neural progenitor cells injected into the injured spinal cord survived for at least a
month, integrated into the host tissue and began to differentiate morphologically. This integrative neonatal mouse model
provides opportunities to explore early adaptive plasticity mechanisms underlying functional recovery as well as the
capacity for human stem cell-derived neurons to integrate functionally into spinal circuits.

Introduction
Adaptive plasticity in the spinal cord has become an important
focus in spinal cord injury (SCI) research due to increasing
evidence that spinal networks in the injured spinal cord of rodents
and cats can reorganize spontaneously following an injury [1–8],
and that this reorganization can be promoted by experimental
manipulation [2,3,9–12]. Post-injury plasticity in the spinal cord
involves the sprouting of spared axons and the formation of novel
synaptic connections and may or may not promote functional
recovery, depending on whether it is adaptive or maladaptive [13].
The potential benefits of adaptive plasticity are fueling efforts to
introduce plasticity-augmenting procedures into clinical trials on
human SCI patients [14].
The adaptive plasticity exhibited by the adult brain and spinal
cord in connection with learning, memory and recovery from
injury is believed to involve at least in part the same mechanisms
that underlie the plasticity of the developing nervous system
[15,16]. Insight into the mechanisms governing adaptive plasticity
following injury in the adult spinal cord may therefore be gained
by characterizing adaptive plasticity following injury in the
immature spinal cord.
SCI also occurs in infants and children in a variety of scenarios,
including birth trauma, accidents, and non-traumatic causes.
Pediatric SCI represents on the order of 5% of all SCI cases but
may be underreported, and is certainly less well investigated than
adult SCI [17]. A particular injury category that is virtually
exclusive to the pediatric population is ‘spinal cord injury without
radiographic abnormality’ (SCIWORA) [18]. SCIWORA is a
consequence of the highly elastic properties of the immature spine,
which permits stretching of the spinal column to extents that cause
injury to the spinal cord with no overt injury to skeletal structures.
Very little is known about the pathogenetic processes involved in
pediatric SCI and its potential recovery, providing an additional

incentive to investigate mechanisms of adaptive plasticity in the
immature spinal cord.
Only a few studies have investigated recovery after SCI that has
been generated in newborn rodents. Some have focused, as in
adult studies, on behavior and anatomy [19,20], whereas others
have begun to assess the molecular and cellular substrates of
recovery, either soon after the injury, at early postnatal stages [21]
or much later, in the adult [22–24]. The neonatal mouse spinal
cord has become a popular preparation for the study of the normal
spinal cord circuitry involved in locomotor pattern generation
[25–27] and in the descending control of spinal motor and
autonomic circuits [25,28–32]. The neonatal mouse is amenable
to a combination of molecular, genetic, anatomical, physiological,
and behavioral approaches to the elucidation of neuronal network
organization. In particular, because of its small size and the
possibility to use highly tractable ex vivo preparations, it is highly
amenable to electrophysiological approaches [33], rapid and
precise tract-tracing [34] and high-throughput optical recording
approaches that permit the dynamic assessment of functional
synaptic connections onto large numbers of spinal neurons
simultaneously [29–32,35,36].
For these reasons, we have become interested in developing a
neonatal mouse SCI model in which mechanisms underlying
adaptive plasticity can be studied with an integrated platform of
approaches, at high throughput and high cellular resolution. In
this regard, we have had two main goals. The first has been to
investigate adaptive plasticity exhibited by brain stem and
propriospinal projections to spinal neurons. The second has been
to develop a model system in which human stem and progenitor
cells can be introduced into an injured spinal cord during the
process of adaptive plasticity to investigate whether this promotes
the functional synaptic integration of derivative human neurons
into spinal networks.
Descending pathways from the brain stem to the spinal cord
and propriospinal pathways are both of utmost importance for the
control of locomotion, posture and autonomic function in
mammals [37–39]. SCI can interrupt these pathways and thus
impair limb control, interlimb coordination and cardiovascular,
bowel, bladder and sexual functions to varying degrees [40]. It is
therefore important to elucidate the extent to which reorganiza-
tion in these pathways occurs after SCI and how this facilitates
functional recovery. However, the pathways subserving various
motor and autonomic functions are diverse. A key goal in this
regard is therefore to assess the range of adaptive plasticity
exhibited by specific descending tracts and propriospinal networks,
and to determine whether augmenting plasticity can be targeted
selectively so as to avoid non-specific effects that may be
maladaptive.
Parallel to the recent advances in understanding adaptive
plasticity in the spinal cord, stem cell-based strategies have been
proposed for replacing neurons that are lost to SCI and other
spinal cord disease (reviewed in [41]). The possibility of generating
any specific type of spinal neuron from stem or progenitor cells
and designing cell replacement therapies based on these has raised
the hope of restoring spinal cord function even in cases when
intrinsic adaptive plasticity may be insufficient. However, intro-
ducing new neurons into a damaged or diseased spinal cord and
coaxing them to survive and integrate into synaptic circuits has its
own set of hurdles and is also saddled with the problem of avoiding
maladaptive sequelae. It is therefore crucial in this regard to design
reproducible SCI models into which different types of human stem
and progenitor cells can be transplanted and their functional
integration tested.
Here we have developed a neonatal mouse SCI model in which
behavioral recovery is substantial and relatively rapid, and in
which we can readily study adaptive plasticity at multiple levels,
from structure to physiology to behavior. We demonstrate much
greater behavioral recovery after thoracic compression injuries
than after complete thoracic transections, we use immunohisto-
chemistry, electron microscopy and tract tracing to characterize
the extent of damage after compression injury, and we use
electrophysiological and high-throughput optical recording to
characterize the recovery of functional synaptic connections from
specific descending tracts onto specific subpopulations of lumbar
motoneurons. We also show that human fetal neuronal progenitor
cells transplanted into the compression-injured neonatal mouse
spinal cord can survive for weeks, during which time they exhibit
signs of morphological differentiation into neurons. We note that
high-throughput optical recording can also be used to assess
descending connections onto specific subpopulations of spinal
interneurons [31] and onto transplanted human cells using either
conventional or optogenetic activity probes. This integrative,
multi-methodological platform employing the neonatal mouse
should provide novel insight into the scope of adaptive plasticity in
the developing mammalian spinal cord, at the level of specific
neuronal network components, including new neurons introduced
into the spinal cord through cell replacement therapies. We
suggest that such information may also be relevant for under-
standing adaptive plasticity in the injured adult spinal cord.
Materials and Methods
Spinal Cord Compression Clip
A surgical aneurysm clip (Yasargil temporary aneurysm mini-
clip, ref. FE681K; applicator from Æsculap, Center Valley, PA,
USA) was modified so that it could be used to generate spinal cord
compression (SCC) injuries in newborn mice. The outside edges of
the blades of the clip were filed down so that blade thickness was
150 mm (Fig. 1A) and a stopper made from a polyethylene
capillary tube (Polyethylene tubing, ID 0.58 mm, OD 0.96, Smiths
Medical, UK, ref. 800/100/200) was placed on one of the blades
to prevent full closure. The interblade distance at full closure was
thus standardized to 230 mm (Fig. 1B).
Spinal Cord Compression Injury
Most surgeries were performed on postnatal day (P)1 wild-type
ICR mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). For
fetal neural progenitor cell injection experiments, immunocom-
promised ICR-SCID mice (Taconic, Denmark) were used to avoid
immune rejection. The experimental protocol was approved by
the Norwegian National Animal Research Authority (FELASA,
local experimental approval number 12.4591) in compliance with
European Union animal care regulations and the National
Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals.
Efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and
their suffering. Animals had free access to food and tap water and
were maintained on a 12 hour light/dark cycle at 2161uC.
Anesthesia was initiated in a closed chamber using 4% isoflurane
(Forene; Abbot-Norge, Norway) vaporized in pure oxygen using a
Cyprane vaporizer (Keighley, UK). When deeply sedated, the
mouse was placed onto a thermal blanket and the snout inserted
into a mask providing a continuous supply of isoflurane and
oxygen. Complete analgesia was obtained by subcutaneous
injection of 50–100 mg of the local anesthetic Marcain (AstraZe-
neca Norge, Norway) at the surgery site (thoracic level (T)9-T12)
allowing subsequent reduction of the isoflurane concentration to
1–2%. After a transverse skin incision and muscle dissection a

laminectomy was performed at T9–12 using thin scissors and thin
forceps (Fine Science Tools, Heidelberg, Germany). Leaving the
dura intact, parts of the facet joints were removed to gain enough
lateral space to insert the compression clip and an extradural
spinal cord compression was performed (Fig. 1C). The spinal cord
was compressed two times for 15 s each with reversal of the blades

in between to achieve symmetrical compression. For complete
spinal cord transection (SCT), the dura was pierced and opened
using a flame-etched 100 mm diameter tungsten needle and the
cord was cut transversely with fine scissors. To ensure complete
transection, the inner vertebral walls were scraped in the plane of
the transection with a micro-knife (Fine Science Tools) to cut all
remaining fibers. Muscle and skin layers were sutured with coated
Vicryl 6–0 (Johnson and Johnson, Berkshire, UK). After surgery
was completed, mice received a subcutaneous injection of 50 ml of
a nutrition-replacement solution (Pedamix; Fresenius Kabi,
Homburg, Germany), removed from the anesthesia mask and
placed in a temperature-controlled isolation cage for 2–3 hours.
Before returning the mice to the litter, the mother was injected
with diazepam (Stesolid, 8 g/kg body weight; Actavis, Iceland) to
reduce aggressiveness and cannibalism. During the first postoper-
ative days, 30 ml of buprenorphine (Temgesic, 0.03 mg/ml;
Schering-Plough, Belgium) were injected subcutaneously once a
day for pain relief. In case of bladder dysfunction (which was not
typical following compression injury, but occurred after transec-
tion injury), bladder massage was performed twice a day until
bladder function was restored. Apart from the injury itself, sham
control animals were treated the same way as injured animals,
including anesthesia, skin and muscle incision and laminectomy.
Behavioral Analysis
A non-weightbearing air stepping test (modified from [42]) was
used to quantify limb motility in sham control, SCC and SCT
mice at different times after surgery/injury (Table 1, total n = 35).
Tests were performed under a heating lamp to avoid hypothermia,
especially at the earliest ages (1 and 4 days after surgery/injury).
Animals were suspended dorsal up from a horizontal bar in a soft
harness that secured the head, body and tail without restraining
limb movements. The harness was adjusted to secure the animal so
that there was no obvious suffering or discomfort. Typically, once
restrained, the animal was quiescent and did not struggle unless
stimulated. The paws were marked in black to facilitate video
kinematic tracking. A mirror was mounted below the animal at a
45-degree angle to permit recording of side and ventral views
simultaneously. After a short period of quiescence the nose was
touched with a smooth metal prod, which led to a series of what
appeared to be escape movements involving alternating flexion
and extension of each limb (air stepping) with variable interlimb
coordination. Video sequences of 1–3 min were taken with a
25 Hz camera (JVC Everio), and at the end of this session the
animal was returned to the litter. Raw interlaced video images
were reformatted into real images using the Avidemux video editor
(http://www.avidemux.org/), sequences of these were imported
into ImageJ [43] and the trajectory of each paw was tracked
frame-by-frame using a ‘‘manual tracking’’ plug-in [44]. The
trajectories (movements of the paws in the x-y plane), trajectory
amplitudes (maximal distance traversed in the x-y plane) and
instantaneous velocities (interframe distance covered divided by
interframe duration) were measured.
A single-track locomotion test was used to quantify gait
parameters in sham control and SCC mice (n = 3 for each group)
24 days after surgery/injury. For gait analyses, mice were placed
in a transparent, rectangular, ceilingless plexiglass corridor (10 cm
wide650 cm high). Mice placed at one end walked readily along
the corridor following a gentle push from behind, and were
videofilmed at 25 Hz through the floor of the corridor. A frame-
by-frame analysis was performed as above and stance durations
were determined by measuring the time from initial contact to
final lift of each paw during successive placements.

Ex vivo Brainstem-spinal Cord Preparation
The dissection procedure for obtaining ex vivo preparations of
the isolated brain stem and spinal cord of neonatal mice has been
described previously [28–31]. In brief, after deep anesthesia
(isoflurane), rapid decerebration and evisceration, a posterior
craniotomy and ventral laminectomy were performed in ice-cold
(1–5uC), oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) glycerol-based
dissecting solution (in mM: glycerol 250, KCl 2, D-glucose 11,
CaCl2 0.15, MgSO4 2, NaH2PO4 1.2, HEPES 5, and NaHCO3
25) to expose the brain stem and the spinal cord with the VIIIth
cranial nerves and ventral spinal roots intact. The brain stem and
spinal cord were then removed into oxygenated artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, containing in mM: NaCl 128, KCl 3,
D-glucose 11, CaCl2 2.5, MgSO4 1, NaH2PO4 1.2, HEPES 5,
and NaHCO3 25). The same type of preparation was used for
electrophysiology and optical recording experiments.

Retrograde Labeling of Spinal Interneurons,
Propriospinal Neurons and Projection Neurons
The procedure for labeling spinal interneurons, propriospinal
neurons and projection neurons with conjugated dextran amine
tracers has been described previously [34,45,46]. Briefly, after
deep isoflurane anesthesia, the animal was decapitated and
eviscerated, a complete ventral laminectomy was performed in
dissecting solution to expose the entire spinal cord, and the
preparation was transferred to oxygenated ACSF at room
temperature (24–28uC). A transverse cut was made across the
right ventral and ventrolateral funiculi, to about midway between
the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the spinal cord, one segment
below the compression site in spinal cord injured animals or at the
same segmental level in sham controls. Immediately thereafter,
several (5–7) small crystals of Rhodamine Dextran Amine (RDA;
tetramethylrhodamine dextran, lysine fixable, 3000 MW; Invitro-
gen) were applied sequentially to the cut creating an exposure to a
high concentration of the tracer for 3–5 minutes. The preparation
was incubated for 6–7 hours at room temperature in oxygenated
ACSF in the dark, after which an 8 segment long piece of the cord
centered on the compression site or equivalent segment in sham
controls was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA;
TAAB Laboratories Equipment Ltd, Aldermaston, Berkshire, UK)
in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4uC. The tissue was
photographed in wholemount under a fluorescence microscope
(Lumar V12 stereomicroscope, Zeiss, Jena, Germany), cryopro-
tected in 20% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS overnight, embedded in
Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Chemi-Teknikk, Oslo, Norway) and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serial transverse sections (30–50 mm)
were made with a cryostat (Leica CM 3050), mounted in 50%
glycerol in 0.1 M PBS, and imaged with a laser scanning confocal
microscope (Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal) at 543 nm. Stacks of 5–7
confocal images with 5 mm z-axis intervals were generated of each
section under a 10x/0.5 objective. Final images were produced by
horizontal projection of each stack using LSM Image Browser 4.2
(Zeiss). Labeled neuron profiles (cell somata only) were counted
manually in each imaged section and in original z-stacks to
corroborate. Profiles were counted in every other section to avoid
double-counting neurons intersected by the section.
Electron Microscopy
Embedding of tissue for electron microscopy was performed as
previously described [47]. Briefly, animals were killed and spinal
cords dissected out as described above. A 4-segment long piece of
the spinal cord centered on the compression site or equivalent
segment in sham controls was immediately fixed for 3 hours in 4%
PFA, 1% glutaraldehyde (EM grade; TAAB) in PBS, pH 7.4,
followed by overnight fixation in 1% PFA, 2.5% glutaraldehyde
(EM grade) in PBS, pH 7.4. Vibratome sections of 500 mm
thickness were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron
Microscopy Science, Washington, PA, USA) in 0.1 M Na-
phosphate buffer, dehydrated in graded ethanols and propylene
oxide and embedded in Durcupan ACM (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). Ultrathin sections were cut and contrasted with
10 mg/ml uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Science) for 9 min
and 3 mg/ml lead citrate for 70 s. The samples were examined
with a Tecnai CM10 electron microscope (FEI Company,
Hillsboro, OR, USA).
Electrical Stimulation of Descending Pathways and Dorsal
Roots
Fire-polished borosilicate glass (1.2 mm OD, 0.94 mm ID;
Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) suction stimulation
electrodes with appropriately sized tip diameters were used to
deliver short (0.2–0.5 ms) electrical current pulses (40–500 mA)
using one of two different stimulators (DS8000, WPI, Sarasota,
FL, USA or S48, Grass Instruments, West Warwick, RI, USA).
Either single pulses (at least 50 s between two consecutive pulses)
or pulse trains (5 Hz for 5 s; at least 3 min between trains) were
used for both electrophysiological and optical recording experi-
ments (see below). Vestibulospinal pathways were activated
specifically by unilateral stimulation of the VIIIth cranial nerve.
General bulbospinal pathways, encompassing the majority of
brainstem-spinal cord descending pathways, were activated by
unilateral stimulation of the ventral funiculus at cervical level (C)1-
C2 or T5 [48,49]. Lumbar sensory afferents were activated by
stimulating a single lumbar dorsal root.
Electrophysiology
Electrophysiological recording of motoneuron discharges was
performed as described previously [49]. Briefly, brainstem-spinal
cord preparations were obtained as described above, and fire-
polished borosilicate glass suction recording electrodes with
appropriately sized tip diameters were placed onto cervical and
lumbar ventral roots. Electrical signals were amplified (EXT 10-2F
amplifier; npi Electronics, Tamm, Germany), digitized, averaged
and analyzed off-line (CED 1401 mkII, SPIKE 2; Cambridge
Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). For recording of compound
action potentials, electrode placement was en passant a short
distance from the root exit site. For recording individual synaptic
events, the ventral root potential was recorded by suctioning the
cut end of the root entirely into the electrode to make a tight
junction with the surface of the spinal cord [49]. Electrophysio-
logical experiments at 8 days after surgery/injury were performed
with a reduced ex vivo preparation of the isolated spinal cord (from
C1 to sacral levels) following the same protocol as above.
Optical Recording of Synaptically Mediated Calcium
Transients
The procedures for optical recording of synaptically mediated
calcium transients have been described previously [28–31]. Briefly,
brainstem-spinal cord preparations were obtained as described
above, and spinal motoneurons (MNs) were labeled retrogradely
with Calcium Green Dextran Amine (CGDA; Calcium Green-1
dextran, lysine fixable, 3000 MW; Invitrogen) by applying crystals
to transected ventral roots and incubating the preparation in
oxygenated ACSF at room temperature (24–28uC) for 3 h in the
dark. The preparation was then pinned ventral side-up to the
Sylgard-coated bottom of a recording chamber (volume 8 ml) and
continuously superfused (3–4 ml/min) with oxygenated ACSF at
post-injury. Note the paucity of axons and loosely organized membrane structures (inset). (C) Gray matter in sham control spinal cord at P2.
Dendrites, axon terminals, synapses (inset), and subcellular structures such as mitochondria, synaptic vesicles and postsynaptic densities (arrowheads)
can be observed. (D) Gray matter in a SCC spinal cord 1 day post-injury. Degenerated structures (inset) are present among less compromised but

room temperature. Optical recording of calcium transients was
performed with an epi-fluorescence microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss)
and a high-sensitivity CCD camera (Photometrics Cascade 650;
Texas Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA) under a 40x water
immersion objective (LUMPlanFl, 0.8 NA; Olympus). For
additional equipment details see [29]. Fluorescence intensity was
measured within separate regions of interest placed over individual
MN somata. Calcium transient waveforms (changes in fluores-
cence relative to initial fluorescence, DF/F) reflected postsynaptic
activity in spinal MNs in response to stimulation of specific inputs,
and were generated by averaging 6–10 calcium transients from the
same region of interest. The area under the waveform, delimited
temporally by the stimulation duration, was measured to give an
indication of response magnitude.
Culture and Viral Transduction of Human Fetal Neural
Progenitor Cells (f-NPCs)
F-NPCs (ReNcell VM [50]; Millipore) were cultured on culture
dishes coated with laminin (0.1 mg/ml). Lentiviral transduction
with an Emerald Green Fluorescent Protein (EmGFP) vector was
performed as described previously [51]. A few passages after viral
transduction the cells were harvested for transplantation. About
30 min before transplantation, cells were rinsed in PBS and
trypsinized to single cell suspension, centrifuged (300 g, 6 min)
and resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium, transferred to a
1.5 ml tube and centrifuged a second time (300 g, 6 min) to
remove excess medium. As much as possible of the supernatant
was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in the remaining
amount and placed on ice until transplantation.
Fetal Neural Progenitor Cell Transplantation
2 ml of cell suspension was sucked into the tip of a sharp glass
micropipette made from glass capillaries (borosilicate 1.2 mm OD,
0.94 mm ID; GC120T-10, Harvard Apparatus) using an electrode
puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). The micropipette
was connected to an air-pressure device (PV830 Pneumatic
PicoPump, WPI) and mounted on a micromanipulator for
placement of the tip into the spinal cord of recently injured
SCC animals while still under anesthesia. To eliminate movements
of the spinal column caused by respiration, the column was
suspended by attaching surgical sutures into the paravertebral
muscles caudal and rostral to the laminectomy and hoisting gently
from a surrounding frame. A 1.5 ml volume of cells (about 25000
cells) was injected rostral to the compression site at a rate of 1 ml
per 5 min to minimize increases in intraspinal pressure. The
pipette was then slowly retracted to avoid reflux of the injected
cells, and the wound was sutured as described above for spinal
cord injury.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry on 30 mm cryostat sections was per-
formed as previously described [52]. Briefly, sections were blocked
for unspecific binding for 1 hour with 10% normal goat serum
(NGS) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-
100, pH7.4 (TBST). Sections were further incubated overnight
with primary antibodies diluted in 1% NGS in TBST. Anti-
neurofilament H (AB1989; Millipore) and Anti-NeuN-biotinylated
(MAB377B; Millipore) were used at 1/400 dilution. The sections
were rinsed 3x in 1% NGS in TBST and incubated for 1 hour
with AlexaFluor-647 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A21247, diluted
1/400) and streptavidin-CY2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 016-
220-084, diluted 1/200) in 1% NGS in TBST. The sections were
rinsed in 1% NGS in TBST and incubated in PBS containing the
nuclear stain Hoechst 33258 (1 mg/ml) for 5 min, further rinsed in
PBS and mounted in PBS-glycerol 1:1.
Statistics
Statistical comparison of means was performed using the non-
parametric Mann-Whitney U test.
Results
Creating a Reproducible Procedure for SCC in Neonatal
Mouse
In preliminary experiments we determined through exploratory
surgery that reproducible dorsoventral compression would be
difficult to perform in the neonatal mouse spinal cord without
extensive surgery and high mortality. We therefore chose to focus
on lateral compression, which could be achieved with less invasive
surgery. A drop weight contusion approach as is often used in
adult rats [53] was discarded on the basis of size constraints.
In neonatal mice, the thoracic spinal cord is 1.2 to 1.5 mm wide
and leaves only a narrow residual intrathecal space to place a
compression clip. Thus, we filed down the blades of Yasargil
Phynox aneurysm clips to reduce their thickness to 150 mm
(Fig. 1A,B). Filing was done manually and therefore the blades
could not be assumed to be identical. Moreover, we placed a
stopper made from polypropylene tubing on one blade to provide
consistent interblade distance on compression. To avoid any
asymmetry in the compression of the cord, we performed two
compressions switching the orientation of the clip between the
compressions. Typically a clip could be used for about 80
compressions (40 animals) before the spring had weakened to
the point that the opposing blade no longer met the stopper.
A total of 104 ICR and 19 SCID-ICR mice were used and
overall mortality was about 30%, occurring either during surgery
(particularly in the early stages of the project, when anesthesia and
surgical procedures were being developed, and therefore over-
represented in sham controls) or during the first few days
thereafter. Fifty-six ICR mice and 19 SCID-ICR mice received
SCC (mortality 18/56 and 6/19, respectively), 8 ICR mice
received SCT (mortality 2/8), and 40 ICR mice were sham
controls (mortality 15/40), which were carried through all surgical
procedures except for the SCC itself. Table 1 presents an overview
of the various experimental procedures carried out on the
surviving animals.
Tissue Damage Associated with SCC
Immediately following SCC, the compressed region of the
spinal cord became darker and swollen, characteristic of hemor-
rhagic contusion and edema (Fig. 1C). Six to nine hours after the
compression, the injured area could be recognized in the dissected
spinal cord by the presence of epidural blood forming a dark band
(Fig. 1D). At 15–30 days post-injury a pronounced atrophy of the
rostral to the compressed region (or the equivalent in sham animals) and immediately caudal to the RDA application site (see also Fig. S1). Bars
represent averages of total counts taken from every other section in the relevant 1 mm length of spinal cord, with number of animals indicated in the
first graph. Error bars represent standard deviations. Differences in counts of dIINs and dCINs between sham control and SCC animals are significant
at p,0.025 at 1 day after surgery/injury and at p,0.01 at 14 days after surgery/injury (Mann-Whitney U-test, U = 0 in both cases). Scale bars: 100 mm.

spinal cord was visible at the compression site, and at higher
magnification the compression site was translucent whereas
normal tissue rostral and caudal to the compression site remained
opaque (Fig. 1D). A similar appearance was also observed in the
case of full transection injuries (Fig. 1D). In some cases of SCC an
endomedullary syringomyelia formed at the injury site (not
shown).
To characterize the damage at the cellular level, we used
immunohistochemistry to assess the number and distribution of
neurons and axons in and near the site of the SCC using
antibodies against the neuronal proteins NeuN and 200 kD
neurofilament, respectively (Fig. 2). One day after the injury,
NeuN immunostaining was diminished within the compressed
region relative to areas immediately rostral and caudal (Fig. 2A).
By 14 days after injury, well after edema had subsided, NeuN
immunostaining was limited to a small fraction of neurons within
the compressed region relative to numbers seen more rostral and
caudal (Fig. 2B). Neurofilament immunostaining showed that
many axons still traversed the compressed region at 1 day after
injury, although some axon fascicles appeared interrupted
(Fig. 2C). By 8 days after injury, there appeared to be white
matter continuity across the compressed region, despite the
marked narrowing of the spinal cord (Fig. 2D). Thus, it appeared
that most neurons within the compressed region had succumbed
to cell death, whereas a substantial proportion of axons was
spared.
We also investigated the ultrastructural organization of the
spinal cord in and near the compression site with electron
microscopy to obtain a general picture of the damage that
obtained (Fig. 3). This was performed 1 day after injury to try to
capture events occuring during the dynamic phase of tissue
damage. In sham controls (n = 2) the ventral and ventrolateral
white matter was replete with unmyelinated axons (Fig. 3A). By
contrast, in SCC animals (n = 3), the ventral and ventrolateral
white matter showed clear signs of axonal degeneration in a
substantial proportion of axons (Fig. 3B). In the grey matter of
sham controls, structures typical of normal spinal cord tissue at P1
were seen, including axons, axon terminals, dendrites and synapses
with an appropriate composition of intracellular organelles and
cytoskeleton (Fig. 3C). In the grey matter of SCC animals, by
contrast, clear signs of degeneration were present, including
structurally disrupted dendrites and axons with poorly organized
cytoskeletal elements (Fig. 3D), cell somata with cytoplasmic
vacuoles, poorly defined organelles and indented, prefragmentary
nuclei (Fig. 3E) and cell debris (Fig. 3F).
To assess damage to identifiable populations of spinal neurons,
we applied the retrograde axonal tracer RDA [45,46] unilaterally
just caudal to the compressed region 1 day or 14 days after SCC or
sham surgery. This labels interneurons, propriospinal neurons and
projection neurons, which for simplicity we will refer to collectively
as interneurons (INs; see [34] for a general discussion of this
terminology). We quantified the number of ipsilaterally projecting
and commissural INs with descending axons (dIINs and dCINs,
located rostral to the application site) or ascending axons (aIINs
and aCINs, located caudal to the application site, Fig. 4), as
previously described in the neonatal mouse and rat [34]. The
expectation was that specifically the dIINs and dCINs should be
diminished in number because their axons were damaged at a site
between their somata and the RDA application site (Fig. 4A).
Figures 4B and 4C show representative retrograde labeling of
dCIN and aCIN populations in sham and SCC animals,
illustrating the dramatic decrease in labeled dCINs at both post-
injury timepoints. Retrogradely labeled neurons were then
counted in the region caudal to the RDA application site (aIINs
and aCINs) and rostral to the compressed region (dIINs and
dCINs; these were only counted rostral to the compressed region,
not within the compressed region, for appropriate comparison to
sham controls, see Fig. S1). In sham controls we found a normal
distribution of each interneuron type, with numbers decreasing
gradually with distance from the application site (n = 3, see Fig.
S1). In SCC mice (n = 6), aIINs and aCINs exhibited the same
distribution as in sham controls, decreasing in number with
distance caudal to the application site. By contrast, dIINs and
dCINs were virtually absent within the compressed region (as
expected, since we had already seen a dramatic loss of neurons
within this region, Fig. 2B), and dramatically diminished rostral to
the compressed region compared to sham controls (Fig. 4D).
Behavioral Assessment Shows an Initial Phase of
Hindlimb Paralysis Followed by a Gradual, Substantial
Recovery
Since early postnatal mice cannot perform weight-bearing
locomotion, we tested the effect of SCC on motor behavior using
an air-stepping assay (modified from [42]) in which mice were
suspended in a soft harness and stimulated by touching the nose.
Movements of all 4 limbs were video recorded at 25 Hz and
analyzed kinematically. Within 6 hours after SCC there was a
dramatic deficit in hindlimb motility, measured as movement
trajectory and instantaneous velocity (Fig. 5A, n= 8), compared to
sham controls. We then compared behavioral recovery at different
time points in SCC mice (4 days and 8 days after SCC, n= 7 each;
14 days after SCC, n= 4), in SCT mice (4 days after SCT, n= 6; 8
days and 14 days after SCT, n= 3 each), and in sham controls (6
hours after surgery, n = 4; 4 days after surgery, n= 7; 8 days after
surgery, n= 6; 14 days after surgery, n= 5). Reflecting the ongoing
motor development during the postnatal period, in the sham
control mice there was an increase in trajectory amplitude and the
proportion of rapid movements (.170 mm/sec instantaneous
velocity) during the 2 weeks following surgery (Fig. 5B, C; Fig.
S2A, B). SCT mice showed a dramatic loss of hindlimb motility 6
hours after the injury similar to that in SCC mice (Fig. 5A, C).
From this deficit, SCC mice exhibited a marked recovery of rapid
movements (.170 mm/sec) and trajectory amplitudes (Fig. 5C,
D). Average trajectory amplitudes and proportions of movements
exceeding 170 mm/sec had reached 80% of the levels exhibited
by sham controls by 14 days post-injury (Fig. 5C, D). By contrast,
SCT mice exhibited some recovery of trajectory amplitude but no
recovery of rapid movements by 4 days post-injury, and exhibited
little if any additional recovery thereafter (Fig. 5 C, D).
To assess behavioral recovery at later stages, we videotaped
sham and SCC animals during a single-track locomotion test 24
days after surgery/injury. At this time, animals in the 2 groups
were virtually indistinguishable when performing this test, and an
analysis of gait showed no obvious differences in the stance
durations of the forepaws or the hindpaws (Fig. S2C, D).

Electrophysiological Assessment Shows an Initial Loss of
Bulbospinal Inputs to Lumbar Motoneurons Followed by
Recovery
One of the advantages of neonatal mice is the possibility to
make ex vivo preparations of the isolated brain stem and spinal cord
in which descending motor pathways can be assessed physiolog-
ically [28–32,49]. As a first step towards assessing the temporal
pattern of recovery in general bulbospinal inputs to lumbar
motoneurons (MNs), we isolated the brain stem and spinal cord
from SCC and sham control mice and stimulated electrically the
ventral funiculus (VF) at C1 while recording extracellularly from
lumbar ventral roots en passant (Fig. 4A [48,49]). Recordings from
cervical ventral roots were included to compare with responses to
bulbospinal inputs that had not been damaged by the SCC.
In sham controls (n = 3), repetitive stimulation (25 pulses in 5 s)
elicited a repetitive discharge in cervical roots (Fig. 6B1, C1, black
traces) and lumbar roots (Fig. 6B2, C2, black traces), starting with
the first and ending a few seconds after the last stimulation pulse.
The compound action potential discharge rate was generally
similar in cervical and lumbar roots (<200 Hz) with no observable
difference between 6 hours (Fig. 6B1, C1) and 4 days (Fig. 6B2,
C2) post-surgery.
By contrast, in SCC mice, VF stimulation at C1 6 hours after
injury (n = 5), still elicited a normal discharge in cervical roots
(Fig. 6B1, red trace), but no discharge in lumbar roots (Fig. 6B2,
red trace). By 4 days post-injury (n = 4), the lumbar root discharge
had partially recovered (Fig. 6C2, red trace), but was delayed and
less intense than in sham controls (Fig. 6C2, black trace).
To characterize the responses in more detail, we made
recordings with the electrodes tightly sealed to the ventral root
exit point and used single pulse stimulation. This recording
configuration, due to proximity of the electrode to the MN
somata, provides information about synaptic responses in the
MNs. Responses to VF and dorsal root stimulation were compared
to identify mono- and polysynaptic components ([54]; Fig. 6D). In
both cases, an initial large amplitude waveform could be identified
as the monosynaptic component (Fig. 6D, black arrowhead),
followed by a series of smaller waveforms constituting polysynaptic
components (Fig. 6D, white arrowheads). Monosynaptic compo-
nents to VF stimulation had consistently shorter latencies in
cervical than lumbar roots, and increased in amplitude with
increasing stimulation intensity, with no change in latency (not
shown; see [54]). Polysynaptic components were more variable in
duration but did not vary noticeably in amplitude with stimulation
intensity (not shown).
Four days after injury/surgery, the cervical monosynaptic
component in response to VF stimulation was similar in SCC
(Fig. 6D1, black trace) and sham control mice (Fig. 6D1, red
trace). By contrast, the lumbar monosynaptic component in

Neonatal Mouse Model for Spinal Cord Injury
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71701
response to VF stimulation had a substantially lower magnitude in
SCC (Fig. 6D2, black trace) than in sham control mice (Fig. 6D2,
red trace). Moreover, an abnormally long delay was often seen
between the monosynaptic and the polysynaptic components in
the SCC mice (Fig. 6D2, see red arrow). Monosynaptic and
polysynaptic responses following same-segment dorsal root stim-
ulation were not noticeably different in SCC and sham mice
(Fig. 6D3 [54]), indicating that only the descending inputs had
been affected by the injury. Thus, when electrophysiological
responses reappear during the first 4 days of recovery from SCC
they exhibit an altered pattern of monosynaptic and polysynaptic
components.
Eight days after surgery, responses to VF stimulation had
become much more similar in SCC and sham control mice, both
in terms of overall discharge during train stimulation, the
amplitudes of monosymaptic inputs and the latencies of polysyn-
aptic inputs (Fig. S3). Thus, in parallel with behavioral recovery,
there is a recovery of the strength of responses of lumbar MNs to
general bulbospinal inputs.
Optical Recording Demonstrates Post-lesional Plasticity
in Descending Inputs to Lumbar MNs
We have previously shown that optical recording of synaptically
mediated calcium transients facilitates a high-throughput assess-
ment of the spatial pattern of connections from the reticulospinal
tract and the vestibulospinal tract onto spinal MNs [28,30–32].
Here, we used the same approach to study the functional recovery
of general bulbospinal inputs (Fig. 7) and vestibulospinal inputs
(Fig. 8) onto lumbar MNs following SCC.
Stimulating the VF in sham control mice activated MNs in both
the lateral motor column (LMC) and medial motor column
(MMC) of lumbar segments (Fig. 7B1, B2, black traces), as
expected from our earlier work showing that medullary and
pontine reticulospinal inputs target both motor columns in the
lumbar cord [28,55]. By contrast, 6 hours after SCC, responses in
both motor columns were completely abolished (Fig. 7B1, red
trace). By 4 days post-injury, responses in both motor columns had
reappeared, but were weaker (Fig. 7B2, red trace) and more
fatigable to repetitive stimulation (not shown) than in sham
controls (Fig. 7B2, black trace). Responses in cervical MNs were
not affected by SCC (not shown), nor were responses in lumbar
MNs to same-segment dorsal root stimulation (Fig. 7B1, B2, green
traces), indicating that the effect of SCC was specifically on the
bulbospinal projections to the lumbar cord.
As a means to assess the potential reorganization of descending
inputs following SCC, we also examined response heterogeneity
by comparing responses to repetitive stimulation in individual
MNs recorded at higher temporal resolution (50 Hz, Fig. 7C1 and
C2). In sham control mice, responses were very similar in different
MNs, as shown by the similarity of the different color-coded traces
in Fig. 7C1 (middle panel) and the low variability of individual
responses (grey traces) around the mean response (black trace) in
Fig. 7C1 (right panel). By contrast, 4 days post-injury, responses in
individual MNs were substantially more variable, including
response failures (Fig. 7C2), which were rare in sham control
mice. Thus, during recovery from SCC there was much more
heterogeneity in the bulbospinal inputs to individual MNs,
indicating a potential reorganization of synaptic connections.
To further examine potential reorganization of descending
inputs following SCC, we investigated the pattern of vestibulospi-
nal inputs onto MNs in the lumbar LMC and MMC (Fig. 8). Our
earlier work had shown that, in contrast to reticulospinal inputs,
the lateral vestibulospinal tract selectively activates LMC MNs in
ipsilateral lumbar segments, with no detectable calcium transients
in ipsilateral MMC MNs [30]. As expected, on the ipsilateral side
of the spinal cord in sham control mice there was a selective
activation of the lumbar LMC, with no detectable response in the
MMC (Fig. 8B1). As was the case for general bulbospinal inputs,
responses in the LMC to vestibulospinal inputs were completely
eliminated 6 hours post-injury (not shown). By contrast, by 4 days

post-injury responses in the LMC had returned, but were also now
detected in the MMC (Fig. 8B2, B3). This aberrant connection
provides clear evidence for a reorganization of synaptic connec-
tions following SCC.
Human Fetal Neural Progenitor Cells Transplanted into
the Compression-injured Spinal Cord Can Survive and
Begin to Differentiate
Since one of our motivations to develop the neonatal SCC
model is to establish a platform for testing the capacity of human
stem and progenitor cell-derived neurons to integrate functionally
into spinal neural circuits, as a proof of principle we asked whether
human fetal neural progenitor cells (f-NPCs) can be successfully
transplanted into the spinal cord of SCC mice and survive and
differentiate there. In this experiment we transplanted undifferen-
tiated GFP-positive human f-NPCs near the compressed region a
few minutes after SCC (n= 5). Twenty-nine days later we dissected
out, fixed and sectioned the spinal cord and found by laser
scanning microscopy many GFP-positive cells in the region near
the injury site, both in the grey matter and the white matter
(Fig. 9A). Because they expressed GFP, it was possible to see that
the cells had differentiated morphologically and that some had
processes that extended up to several hundred microns from the
somata (Fig. 9B, C). Thus, the neonatal mouse SCC model clearly
supports the survival and differentiation of human progenitor cells.
This provides an opportunity in future experiments to characterize
the formation of functional synapses onto these neurons by
different presynaptic sources including descending projections
from the brain stem.
Discussion
The Rationale for using a Neonatal SCI Model to Study
Post-injury Plasticity
Brain plasticity represents a continuum of processes that spans
from the formation of synapses and networks in prenatal and early
postnatal life to their ongoing modification during adult life.
Although the capacity for plasticity may vary, a number of
underlying mechanisms appear to be relevant throughout the
lifespan, such as the ability of axons to sprout new collateral
branches, the modulation of neurite growth and synaptogenesis by
neurotransmitters and growth factors, and the regulation of
synaptic strengths by patterned activity. One of our working
hypotheses in developing a neonatal SCI model is that the
envelope of plasticity exhibited by the neonatal spinal cord
encompasses the plasticity of which the adult spinal cord is
capable. Indeed, it might be argued that a strong strategy for
promoting regeneration in the adult spinal cord is to reinstate an
earlier developmental condition, and many current approaches,
such as knocking down axon growth inhibitors in myelin,
upregulating trophic factor expression, and introducing stem or
progenitor cells [41], represent precisely that. Describing the scope
of post-injury plasticity in the neonatal spinal cord is in this sense
equivalent to mapping the possibilities that might be made
available experimentally and clinically to the adult spinal cord.
Of more direct relevance is the existence of pediatric spinal cord
injuries that are less well characterized than adult injuries both in
terms of etiology, pathological development and functional
sequelae. There is a general lack of experimental models for
pediatric spinal cord injuries. The model presented here provides a
platform that more likely reflects the pathogenetic and recovery
processes characteristic of the developing human than do adult
animal SCI models.
One of the principal advantages of establishing a model in the
neonatal mouse spinal cord is the opportunity to utilize certain
methodologies that are much more difficult to apply to the adult
spinal cord. Because of its small size, it is very easy to make ex vivo
preparations of the neonatal spinal cord that can be experimen-
tally manipulated with great precision, for example in the tracing
of neuronal projections or the placement of electrodes for
stimulation and recording [34,56]. A valuable approach that we
have helped develop recently is the optical recording of neuronal
activity. This facilitates a high-throughput analysis of synaptic
connections, for example between bulbospinal axons and target
spinal neurons [29,35]. Using optical recording it is possible to
map out, relatively quickly, entire systems of connections in the
neonatal spinal cord that take much longer to elucidate using more
conventional electrophysiological techniques (see for example
[30]). It is important to point out in this respect that, although
new approaches are being developed to facilitate optical recording
also in the adult spinal cord [57], there are significant technical
hurdles to implementing these in the intact adult spinal cord which
make the neonatal spinal cord a more attractive experimental
system. These include the degree of myelination and the sheer
volume of the tissue in the adult cord, both if which severely
hamper optical recording, as well as the difficulty in maintaining ex
vivo preparations of the whole adult cord. Thus, despite the
obvious fact that the neonatal and adult spinal cord differ in many
respects, studying brainstem-spinal cord circuits and their post-
injury plasticity in the neonatal mouse will provide, rather quickly,
a wealth of information that should increase insight into the
synaptic organization and potential for reorganization of the adult
spinal cord.
The main aims of this initial study have thus been to establish a
model for studying pediatric spinal cord injuries, as well as to
demonstrate the advantages of using the neonatal mouse spinal
cord for integrated studies of SCI, including high-throughput
assessment of synaptic connectivity. We intend to use this model
both in the context of post-SCI plasticity and in the context of
integrating stem and progenitor cell-derived progeny into neuro-
nal circuits.
To achieve these aims, we chose to make a compression injury
of the spinal cord. This kind of injury is known to spare a certain
proportion of axons and would thus provide a situation favorable
for axon sprouting and the remodeling of connections. Sprouting
of spared axons and/or remodeling of synaptic connections
without the regrowth of long descending axons have been
described in adult rats and cats with incomplete spinal cord
lesions [1–8,16] and in neonatal rats with complete spinal cord
transections [19,58]. Although there are exceptions, in most cases
reorganization of spinal circuitry has been deduced from
behavioral and anatomical signs, rather than explained in terms
of functional synaptic connections between specific axons and
specific target spinal neurons. This is where we believe the
neonatal mouse model can provide more comprehensive infor-
mation.
Evidence for Reorganization in the Context of the
Developing Spinal Cord
The SCC mice exhibited substantial functional recovery during
the initial two weeks after injury that involved a nearly complete
resolution of hindlimb paralysis and an acquisition of weight-
bearing locomotion. This was paralleled by the reappearance of
mono- and polysynaptic connections from general bulbospinal
axons and, more specifically, from lateral vestibulospinal tract
axons, onto lumbar MNs. The rate at which this recovery
appeared was faster than the ongoing developmental improvement

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 16 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71701
seen in sham control mice, so it is not merely a reflection of
continued development. Moreover, although we cannot rule out a
contribution to the recovery by the later arrival of descending
axons that have not reached thoracic levels at the time of the
injury (corticospinal axons are not fully represented at lumbar
levels until about P14, for example [59]), the fact that mice with a
full SCT recovered hardly at all by comparison (tissue continuity is
regained after SCT) suggests that continued development alone
cannot account for all of the recovery. Rather, it would appear
that at least some of the recovery must be ascribed to the axons
that were spared in the SCC situation. These would have the
opportunity to sprout new collaterals, innervate novel targets
including propriospinal neurons [33], and thus give rise to novel
circuits.
Direct evidence for the formation of novel connections following
SCC is the appearance of vestibulospinal responses in MNs of the
ipsilateral MMC. This connection has not been seen in previous
studies of vestibulospinal inputs to lumbar MNs in uninjured mice
of the same age and strain [30], nor was it ever seen in sham
controls here. The functional significance of this aberrant
connection is unclear, but since the MMC innervates trunk
musculature, it might lead to the activation of proximal hip-
stabilizing muscles. This could conceivably confer an advantage
for generating locomotor movements in a situation where some of
the original descending connections to MNs innervating more
distal musculature have been lost. It will be important in future
experiments to follow this and other potential examples of synaptic
reorganization to later stages to determine whether they are stable
or subject to ongoing modification.
As is characteristic for many regions of the developing CNS
[60], the degree of plasticity seen here is likely to diminish as the
spinal cord matures. Several developmental watersheds occuring
in the spinal cord during the first one to two weeks of postnatal life
will contribute to limiting plasticity. Myelination accelerates
towards the end of the first postnatal week [61–63], and this will
limit axon growth and sprouting [40,64]. Perineuronal nets also
appear in the second postnatal week [65] and would be expected
to limit the capacity for synaptic remodeling. It will therefore be
important to chart the degree of plasticity in specific circuits as the
spinal cord matures to determine whether these restrictive events
exert homogeneous effects on all spinal neurons or whether some
circuits or neuron types maintain a more privileged state. More
information about how and where plasticity is downregulated
would contribute to defining strategies for reintroducing develop-
mental levels of plasticity in the adult spinal cord [16] in a targeted
fashion so as to avoid maladaptive plasticity [13].
Technical Considerations Regarding Compression Injury
in Neonatal Mice
The original clip-compression model described in adult rats
used a modified Kerr-Lougheed aneurysm clip [66–68]. An
advantage of this clip, as well as of drop-weight contusion
apparatuses [53], is that they generate dorsoventral compression,
which is more relevant in a clinical context than lateral
compression, at least for injuries in adults. However, generating
SCC in the neonatal mouse involves small structures, narrow
anatomical spaces, and fragile patients, and it was necessary to
fashion new tools for the purpose. In preliminary experiments, we
found that gaining sufficient access to the vertebral column to
generate dorsoventral compressions required more extensive
laminectomies, which led to higher morbidity, and lifting of the
cord within the vertebral column, which led to less controlled
compressions. Thus, we decided to use lateral compression
instead, which we could perform with less invasive and shorter
duration surgery. To create an appropriate tool for the compres-
sion, we trimmed the blades of a Yasargil aneurysm mini-clip
down to 150 mm thickness so that they could be inserted on either
side of the spinal cord within the vertebral column. Our EM and
retrograde labeling results indicate that the injury we obtained is
symmetrical, affects white matter around the entire perimeter of
the cord, and in particular damages descending and propriospinal
axons in the ventral, ventrolateral and lateral funiculi.
Another advantage of the modified Kerr-Lougheed aneurysm
clip developed by the Tator group is the stability of its closing
strength over the course of many compressions. In addition, the
closing strength can be adjusted by changing the position of the
spring or by using springs of different tensions [68]. Although we
did not measure compression strength directly, we standardized
the blade separation of our clip and therefore the severity of the
compression by placing a stopper on one of the blades. In
principle, different stoppers can be used to change the blade
separation and thus the severity of the compression. However,
more severe compressions can also be performed with the same
stopper by incrementing the number of compressions or increasing
the compression time. An important aspect of clip compression
approaches is that compression strength may decrease with use as
the clip spring weakens, which affects both compression force and
distance. Our clip could be used for as many as 80 compressions
before the spring weakened to the point that the stopper was no
longer reached.
Stem and Progenitor Cell Transplantation and Potential
Integration into Functional Circuits
In the context of spinal cord injury and disease, the two main
potential applications of stem and progenitor cells are the creation
of more favorable environments for repair (promoting axon
growth and sprouting, stimulating endogenous stem cells, allevi-
ating inflammatory events) and the replacement of neurons or glial
cells that have been destroyed [41,69–71]. Our focus is on the
replacement of neurons, and the motivation for this interest is that
some spinal cord injuries and diseases may destroy specific neuron
populations or circuits whose functions may not be recoverable
through adaptive plasticity alone. Our results here underscore this
notion, since we find a substantial, protracted loss of neurons
within the injured region. Numerous studies have shown that
transplanted stem or progenitor cells can give rise to differentiated
neuronal progeny in the injured spinal cord (see for example [72]
and references therein), but relatively little information is available
about the extent to which these exogenous neurons integrate into
functional circuits, and in particular whether they receive
supraspinal inputs or transmit signals across a lesion. In the
neonatal mouse SCC model this can be accomplished rapidly
through optical recording of exogenous neurons that express
genetically encoded activity probes such as the GCaMPs [73].
Future Experiments
One of the versatile features of this SCC model is that the
optical recording approach can be applied to specific subpopula-
tions of spinal neurons at single cell resolution. Here we have
characterized responses in individual motoneurons of the two
different motoneuron columns, the MMC and LMC, at different
levels of the spinal cord. The same approach can be used to record
from local spinal interneurons [29–31], which are known to play
pivotal roles in recovery of function after incomplete SCI in the
adult spinal cord (reviewed in [33]). This can be done using
conventional calcium probes as used here, or using genetic calcium
probes to restrict recording to specific genetically defined
interneuron subpopulations. Our next goal is to take advantage

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 17 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71701
of this unique opportunity to characterize the post-injury
reorganization of spinal circuitry at the level of identified subsets
of interneurons.
