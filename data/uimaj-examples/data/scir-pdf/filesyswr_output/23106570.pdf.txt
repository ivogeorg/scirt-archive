Abstract
In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish recover locomotor functions after spinal cord injury (SCI), in part due to axonal regrowth
and regeneration permissivity of the central nervous system. Upregulation of major vault protein (MVP) expression after spinal
cord injury in the brainstem of the adult zebrafish prompted us to probe for its contribution to recovery after SCI. MVP is a multi-
functional protein expressed not only in many types of tumours but also in the nervous system, where its importance for regener-
ation is, however, unclear. Using an established zebrafish SCI model, we found that MVP mRNA and protein expression levels
were increased in ependymal cells in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site at 6 and 11 days after SCI. Double immunolabelling
showed that MVP was co-localised with Islet-1 or tyrosine hydroxylase around the central canal of the spinal cord in sham-injured
control fish and injured fish 11 days after surgery. MVP co-localised with the neural stem cell marker nestin in ependymal cells
after injury. By using an in vivo morpholino-based knock-down approach, we found that the distance moved by MVP morpholino-
treated fish was reduced at 4, 5 and 6 weeks after SCI when compared to fish treated with standard control morpholino. Knock-
down of MVP resulted in reduced regrowth of axons from brainstem neurons into the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site. These
results indicate that MVP supports locomotor recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI in adult zebrafish.
Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a central nervous system (CNS) lesion
that leads to severe and often permanent disability in mammals
(Karnezis et al., 2004; Silver & Miller, 2004; Harel & Strittmatter,
2006; Schwab et al., 2006). In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish
have a remarkable capacity for functional recovery after injury to
parts of the nervous system such as spinal cord, brain and optic
nerve (Bernhardt et al., 1996; Becker et al., 1997, 2004; Guo et al.,
2011; Kroehne et al., 2011; Baumgart et al., 2012). The ability to
move partly depends on networks of rhythmically active neurons in
the spinal cord, and their activation relies on descending inputs from
the brain or on sensory inputs (McLean & Fetcho, 2009; Kyriakatos
et al., 2011). After SCI, neurons in adult zebrafish can regenerate
axons which reconnect to their appropriate targets, and the injured
fish regain swimming function several weeks later (Becker et al.,
1997, 1998, 2004; Bhatt et al., 2004; Becker & Becker, 2008). In
the complex regeneration process, intrinsic molecules operant in the
brainstem and molecules in the microenvironment of the de-affer-
ented spinal cord play important roles in recovery (Becker et al.,
2004; Abdesselem et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011a,b). The zebrafish
has, thus, become an important model for exploring the molecular
mechanisms underlying functional recovery after SCI.
To search for molecules involved in successful regeneration we
have analysed, by expression profiling, the mRNA levels in the
nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (NMLF) as an indicator
for nuclei with regenerative capacities after SCI (Ma et al., 2012).
One of the molecules found to be upregulated in its expression was
the 100-kDa major vault protein (MVP), the predominant compo-
nent of vaults which contain a small untranslated vault RNA, telo-
merase-associated protein-1 and vault poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.
MVP accounts for up to 75% of the total complex and is highly
conserved from mammals to fungi (Kedersha et al., 1986, 1990;
Vasu & Rome, 1995; Herrmann et al., 1996, 1998; Kickhoefer
et al., 1998; Yoshinari et al., 2009). MVP is identical to the human
lung resistance protein, and its expression is increased in tumours
and multiple drug resistance models (Scheffer et al., 1995, 2000;
Mossink et al., 2003; Lloret et al., 2008). Interestingly, MVP is also
widely expressed in the nervous system of different species (Herr-
mann et al., 1996; Aronica et al., 2003; Komori et al., 2007; Paspa-
las et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011). The wide expression of MVP in
various cell types and considerable phylogenetic conservation point
to its important cellular functions (Kedersha et al., 1990).
In this report, we use a zebrafish SCI model and show that
mRNA and protein levels of MVP are upregulated at 6 and 11 days
after SCI. Morpholino (MO)-mediated knock-down of MVP blocked

re-acquisition of swimming motility after SCI and was associated
with reduced axonal regrowth. Our data indicate that MVP is benefi-
cial for functional recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI in adult
zebrafish.
Materials and methods
Animals
Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio, 6 months old) were purchased from
Huiyuan Aquatic Animals Company (Shantou, Guangdong, China).
Fish were kept on a 14-h light and 10-h dark cycle at 28 °C and fed
twice a day. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College.
Spinal cord injury
Spinal cord transection was performed as described (Becker et al.,
2004; Guo et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011a). Briefly, fish were anes-
thetised by immersion in 0.033% aminobenzoic acid ethylmethylest-
er (MS222; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 5 min. A longitudinal incision was made
at the side of the fish to expose the vertebral column. The spinal
cord was cut between two vertebrae, ~4 mm caudal to the brainstem
–spinal cord transitional junction. Wounds were sealed with Histo-
acryl (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany), and the injured fish were
kept individually at 28 °C. A sham-injured control had the incision
but without spinal cord transection. All surgical procedures were
performed on ice under a microscope.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR)
To study the expression of MVP mRNA in the spinal cord caudal
to the lesion site, total RNA was extracted from the 4-mm pieces of
spinal cord directly caudal to the lesion site at different time points
after SCI. First-strand cDNA was generated using random primers
and ReverTraAceR qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). qPCR
was performed with SYBRR Green Real Time PCR Master Mix
(Toyobo) as described (Goff et al., 2004). Primers for qPCR were
designed using Primer Express 5.0 software (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). All assays were performed in duplicate sam-
ples, and assay products were validated using melting curves to con-
firm the presence of single PCR products. GAPDH served as the
internal control. The following primer sequences were used: zebra-
fish MVP forward, GGAAAGTCGGGCTAAGAA; reverse,
ATCACAGCACGCACCTTT. GAPDH forward, GTGTAGGCGT
GGACTGTGGT; reverse, TGGGAGTCAACCAGGACAAATA (Pei
et al., 2007).
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization probes (sense and antisense) for MVP mRNA
(NM_201325) were transcribed in vitro. Purified PCR fragments
were cloned into the pGM-T vector (Tiangen, Beijing, China), and
the sequences were verified by sequencing. Digoxigenin (DIG)-
labelled sense and antisense RNA probes were generated using the
Megascript system (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Non-radioactive detection of mRNA in
sections of adult zebrafish CNS was performed as described (Bern-
hardt et al., 1996). The spinal cords were fixed for 24 h in 4% para-
formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C, followed by incubation in 15%
sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Then, 16-lm-thick sections of
spinal cords were cut from fresh-frozen tissue on a cryostat, pre-
hybridised for 2 h at 55 °C and hybridised with the DIG-labelled
probes at 55 °C overnight. After extensive washings at 50 °C, alka-
line phosphatase-coupled anti-DIG fragment antibodies (Fabs;
Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were applied at room temperature
for 1 h. Antibody binding was detected using an alkaline phospha-
tase reaction with nitro-blue-tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-
3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP; Roche) as substrates. For negative
control, sense probes were developed in parallel under the same
conditions as the antisense probes. The sense probe showed no reac-
tivity (data not shown). Sections from sham-injured control and
injured fish were analysed on the same slides. Sections were viewed
and photographed using an epifluorescence microscope (Axio Ima-
ger Z1; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
Immunohistochemistry
All tissues were processed for immunofluorescence after fixation in
4% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Serial sections (16 lm
thick) from spinal cord (longitudinal, 0–4 mm caudal to lesion site)
were used. Sections were prepared as described above and processed
for immunostaining (Guo et al., 2011). The primary antibodies were
rabbit anti-MVP (1 : 200; Bioss, Beijing, China), mouse anti-Islet-1
(1 : 100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of
Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA), mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH+;
1 : 400; Millipore), Rabbit anti-nestin (1 : 200; Boster, Wuhan,
China) and mouse anti-synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2; 1 : 200;
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Secondary antibodies
were Alexa Fluor CY3 goat antirabbit IgG (1 : 800; Jackson Immu-
noResearch) and FITC goat antimouse IgG (1 : 800; Jackson Immu-
noResearch). Fluorescence images were collected using an
epifluorescence microscope (Axio Imager Z1; Zeiss).
Western blot analysis
Total protein was extracted by homogenizing the spinal cord tissue
(0–4 mm caudal to lesion site) in RIPA buffer (Soliba, Beijing,
China). After centrifugation of the homogenate at 14 000 g and 4 °C
for 5 min, the protein concentration in the supernatant was deter-
mined with a BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The supernatant
was denatured by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Fifty
micrograms of total protein were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on
8% gels. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane and probed with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-
MVP (1 : 200; Bioss) and mouse anti-GAPDH (1 : 1000; Beyotime,
Haimen, China). Goat antirabbit IgG and goat antimouse IgG
(1 : 1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) conjugated to horseradish per-
oxidase were used as secondary antibodies. The grey value of
each band was measured and normalised to that of the GAPDH b
and by IMAGEJ software (NIH).
MO treatment
MOs are synthetic molecules that are the product of a redesign of
natural nucleic acid structures. MOs targeting the start codon region
can interfere with the progression of the ribosomal initiation com-
plex from the 5′ cap to the start codon and prevent translation of the
coding region of the targeted transcript, thus decreasing the protein
expression level (Summerton & Weller, 1997). Previous data from
our lab showed that the fluorescein-tagged MOs are still detectable
6 weeks after application, indicating that MOs can reduce protein
levels for as long as 6 weeks after SCI (Becker et al., 2004).

MVP antisense MO 5′-GATCAGCGTCCATGTTTCTTCCTAC-3′
and standard control MO 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTA-
TA-3′ vivo-porter coupled (Gene Tools, Philomath, OR, USA) were
dissolved in Danieau solution (Nasevicius & Ekker, 2000) and
soaked onto small pieces of Gelfoam (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI,
USA). The pieces were divided into smaller pieces to yield 600 ng of
MO, ~0.22 lL per piece, and allowed to dry. One piece was applied
to the transection site immediately after spinal cord transection.
Swim tracking
Swimming capabilities of injured fish were assessed each week after
MO application for 6 weeks in two trials of 5 min each (trial inter-
val, 4 h). In each trial, a zebrafish was placed in a brightly illumi-
nated (100 lux) tank (42 9 30 9 30 cm) filled with aquarium water
(5 cm deep) at 25 °C. A video camera recorded the trials from
above the tank. Swim paths were tracked with ETHOVISION software
(Noldus, Wageningen, the Netherlands). Mean lengths of the swim
paths (total distance moved) of the two trials were used for graphi-
cal presentation and statistical analysis. The experimenter was
blinded to the treatment of the animals.
Retrograde tracing
Retrograde axonal tracing was performed by application of tracer bio-
cytin (Sigma) 4 mm caudal to the spinal lesion site 6 weeks after
transection (see Fig. 5 for illustration; Becker et al., 1997, 2004; Yu
et al., 2011a). In brief, Gelfoam pieces soaked in a saturated solution
of biocytin or rhodamine dextran amine were left at the lesion site for
the tracer to be retrogradely transported. Twenty-four hours after
application, brains were dissected and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in
PBS overnight and embedded in 15% sucrose at 4 °C. Serial coronal
brain sections (20 lm thick) were obtained using a cryostat. Biocytin
labelling in the sections was detected with Streptavidin-Cy3 (1 : 200;
Bioss). Labelled neurons in the whole NMLF were counted in brain-
stem sections using an epifluorescence microscope (Axio Imager Z1;
Zeiss) by an investigator blind to treatment. Three animals were in
each group (treated with control MO and MVP MO).
Anterograde tracing
To study presynaptic endings from regenerating axons past the
lesion site, biocytin was applied at the brainstem–spinal cord junc-
tion through a second surgery 6 weeks after SCI (see Fig. 6 for
illustration; Becker et al., 1997, 2004; Yu et al., 2011a). After 24 h,
spinal cords were removed, and tissue 0–4 mm in length caudal to
the original spinal lesion site was fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS
at 4 °C overnight, embedded in 15% sucrose, and sectioned (20-
lm-thick sections) coronally on a cryostat. Biocytin labelling was
detected with Streptavidin-Cy3. Fluorescence intensity is presented
as the mean intensity evaluated by IMAGEJ software (NIH) from 12
randomly counterpart selected sections of spinal cords 0–4 mm cau-
dal to the lesion site from each group. Three animals were in each
group (treated with control MO or MVP MO).
Statistical analysis
Using SPSS 13.0 software, Student′s t-test was used for comparing
two treatment groups, and one-way ANOVA was used for multiple
group comparisons. All data are presented as means ± SEM.
P < 0.05 is set as indicating significance (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
All experiments were performed three times independently.
Results
MVP mRNA expression levels were increased caudal to the
lesion site
To measure the levels of MVP mRNA after SCI, we collected
spinal cord tissue extending 4 mm caudally from the lesion site at
4, 12 h, 6 and 11 days after SCI. The 4- and 12-h time points rep-
resent the acute response phase while those of 6 and 11 days after
SCI represent the chronic response phase (see, for instance, Guo
et al., 2011). At 4 and 12 h after SCI, MVP mRNA expression lev-
els (with 1.16 ± 0.14 and 1.38 ± 0.18-fold increases, respectively;
one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, P > 0.05, n = 6) were
not different from those of sham-injured controls, while significant
upregulation was observed at 6 days, with a 1.74 ± 0.098-fold
increase (one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, **P < 0.01,
n = 6), and at 11 days, with a 1.82 ± 0.226-fold increase (one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, *P < 0.05, n = 6) after SCI
(Fig. 1A).
To analyse the cells that express MVP in the spinal cord caudal
to the lesion site, we performed in situ hybridization (Fig. 1B).
MVP mRNA-positive signals were limited to the ependymal cells
lining the central canal and the area surrounding the central canal
corresponding to the gray matter (Fig. 1B). More cells expressed
MVP at 6 and 11 days after SCI than at 4 and 12 h after SCI or
in the sham-injured control groups. Uninjured fish were not differ-
ent from the sham-injured control fish (data not shown). The
MVP sense probe showed no reactivity (data not shown). These
observations are in agreement with the levels of mRNA expression
seen by qPCR, suggesting that MVP mRNA levels are not chan-
ged in the acute phase after SCI but are increased in the chronic
phase.
MVP protein expression levels were increased caudal to the
lesion site
To investigate whether the increase in MVP mRNA levels corre-
sponds to an increase in protein expression, we performed immuno-
blotting of the 100-kDa MVP with spinal cord tissue harvested at 4
and 12 h and at 6 and 11 days after SCI (Fig. 2A). No significant
differences in MVP expression levels were observed at 4 or 12 h
after SCI (Fig. 2B) between lesioned fish and sham-injured controls.
Uninjured fish showed expression levels not different from those of
sham-injured fish (not shown). Consistent with the mRNA data, lev-
els of MVP protein were increased in the spinal cord caudal to the
lesion site at 6 and 11 days after SCI (Fig. 2A and B). Densitomet-
ric analysis showed an increase in MVP protein levels at 6 days
(1.602 ± 0.072, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test,
**P < 0.01; n = 4) and 11 days (1.798 ± 0.136, one-way ANOVA
with Tukey’s post hoc test, **P < 0.01; n = 4) after SCI compared
to sham-injured controls (Fig. 2B).
To further study MVP protein expression and distribution, we
performed immunofluorescence staining on spinal cord sections.
MVP-positive cells were located predominantly in the area sur-
rounding the central canal at 11 days after SCI (Fig. 2C), and MVP
protein was mainly detectable in the cytoplasm. MVP protein
expression levels in injured fish were increased at 6 and 11 days
after SCI in cells surrounding the central canal when compared to
the sham-injured controls (Fig. 2D, m–x), but were similar in sham-
injured controls and injured fish at earlier time points (Fig. 2D, a–i).
Uninjured fish were not different from the sham-injured control fish
(data not shown, but see Supplemental Fig. 1 in EJN blog for the
time point of 4 hours).

MVP promotes spinal cord regeneration 205
MVP co-localised with Islet-1, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
nestin caudal to the lesion site
To examine which type of neurons expresses MVP we performed
double immunofluorescence labelling for MVP and the motor neuro-
nal marker Islet-1 or the noradrenergic and dopaminergic neuronal
marker TH. The results showed that MVP is expressed in motor
neurons and noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons at 11 days
after SCI (Fig. 3A and B). MVP-immunopositive cells were limited
to the area surrounding the central canal, which prompted us to
identify whether MVP is expressed in nestin-positive stem cells.
Double immunostaining for MVP and nestin showed that MVP and
nestin are coexpressed in ependymal cells lining the central canal
and in some cells distributed in the spinal cord parenchyma
(Fig. 3C).
MVP promoted locomotor recovery after SCI
To investigate whether application of an antisense MVP MO to the
freshly injured spinal cord affects MVP protein expression in vivo,
Western blot analysis was performed 11 days after SCI. MVP pro-
tein levels were reduced by 75% in the MVP MO-treated group at
this time point after SCI compared to standard control MO (Fig. 4A
and B).
To examine the swimming ability of adult zebrafish treated with
MVP MO at the lesion site and at the time of SCI, we analysed
locomotor recovery weekly by measuring the distance swum in
5 min. No differences were observed between the groups treated
with MVP MO and standard control MO up to 3 weeks after SCI
(Fig. 4C). However, reduced locomotor recovery of MVP MO vs.
standard control MO-treated fish was found at 4, 5 and 6 weeks
(Fig. 4C). At 4 weeks after SCI, the total distance moved by fish
treated with MVP MO (1376.1 ± 214.4 cm, n = 11, one-way ANOVA
with post hoc Student–Newman–Keuls test, *P < 0.05) was reduced
to 67.7% of that of fish treated with standard control MO
(2032.7 ± 201.9 cm, n = 11). Similarly, the total distance moved by
fish treated with MVP MO (5 weeks, 1323.6 ± 149.6 cm, n = 11,
one-way ANOVA with post hoc Student–Newman–Keuls test,
*P < 0.05; 6 weeks, 1557.5 ± 205.2 cm, n = 11, one-way ANOVA
with post hoc Student–Newman–Keuls test, *P < 0.05) was
decreased to 66.2 and 71.7% of that from the control group
(5 weeks, 1998.7 ± 140.8 cm, n = 11; 6 weeks, 2171.4 ± 183.4 cm,
n = 11) at 5 and 6 weeks, respectively. Standard control MO did
not affect locomotor recovery as swim distance between spinal cord-
injured fish and spinal cord-injured fish treated with standard control
MO were not different at 6 weeks after SCI, as observed previously
(Becker et al., 2004). Thus, MVP MO treatment significantly
impaired locomotor recovery, indicating a requirement for MVP in
spinal cord regeneration.
MVP MO application reduced the number of NMLF neurons
with regenerated axons
NMLF neurons play a critical role in swimming activity and can
regrow axons to the ipsilateral spinal cord after SCI (Uematsu &
Todo, 1997; Takeda et al., 2007). To investigate whether MVP MO
treatment affects axon regrowth after SCI, we performed retrograde
tracing by applying biocytin 6 weeks after the lesion, 4 mm caudal
to the lesion site in the same fish tested for locomotor function

(Fig. 5A). Brain sections from fish treated with MVP and control
MO were probed for the biocytin tracer using streptavidin-Cy3. Fish
treated with MVP MO showed a reduced number of biocytin-
labelled NMLF neurons (Fig. 5B and C), indicating impaired re-
growth of the axons from NMLF neurons following MVP knock-
down. The number of retrogradely labelled neurons was significantly
reduced, by 60.3% in MVP MO-treated fish (15 ± 0.58 cells, n = 3)
relative to the number in control MO-treated fish (25 ± 0.89 cells,
n = 3; t-test, *P < 0.05; Fig. 5D).
MVP MO treatment reduced the number of synapses caudal
to the lesion site
The reformation of functional synapses is essential for locomotor
recovery after SCI (Becker et al., 2004). To label synapses formed
by regrown axons of supraspinal origin caudal to the injury site, bio-
cytin was applied at the brainstem–spinal cord transition after MO
treatment, and co-localization of the tracing signals with the synaptic
marker SV2 was analysed 6 weeks after SCI (Fig. 6A). The extent
of anterograde tracing (red) was considerably higher in sections of
control MO-treated fish (Fig. 6B), with a 2.17-fold increase (t-test,
*P < 0.05, n = 3) compared to MVP MO-treated fish (Fig. 6C and
D), indicating that knock-down of MVP reduces numbers of syn-
apses caudal to the injury site. Few co-localization signals were
observed in MVP MO-treated fish when compared to control MO-
treated fish (Fig. 6E), confirming that knock-down of MVP pre-
vented regrowth of axons in parallel with a reduction in number of
new synapses caudal to the lesion site.
Discussion
Zebrafish have the remarkable ability to regenerate injured tissue
compared to many higher vertebrates (Becker et al., 1997; Raya
et al., 2003; Reimer et al., 2008; Stewart et al., 2009; Guo et al.,
2011; Kroehne et al., 2011). Using an adult zebrafish spinal cord
injury model, we demonstrate for the first time that both MVP

MVP promotes spinal cord regeneration 207
mRNA and protein expression levels are increased at 6 and 11 days,
but not at 4 and 12 h, after SCI, using qPCR and Western blot anal-
ysis, suggesting that MVP plays a critical role in spinal cord regen-
eration in the chronic phase but not in the early phase of recovery
after SCI.
Double immunostaining of MVP with Islet-1 or TH at 11 days
after SCI supports the view that subpopulations of neurons express
MVP. These neurons have been shown previously to be newly
formed neurons around the injury site 10 days after SCI in adult
zebrafish (Hui et al., 2010). Expression of MVP in different types
of neurons is in agreement with reports showing MVP expression in
the nervous system of humans, non-human primates, rodents and
electric fish (Herrmann et al., 1996; Aronica et al., 2003; van Vliet
et al., 2004; Paspalas et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011). In addition to
being expressed by newly formed neurons in the vicinity of the cen-
tral canal, MVP is also expressed by nestin-immunoreactive neural
stem cells that comprise the radial glia-type progenitor cells lining
the central canal as ependymal cells. These ependymoradial glial
cells are progenitor cells for motor neurons after SCI (Reimer et al.,
2008). Radial glial cells in the ependymal layer begin to migrate
away from the lesion site at 3 days after injury, and accumulation in
the parenchyma around the injury site continues till 7 days (Hui
et al., 2010). Extending these time points we found that, at 11 days
after SCI, MVP and nestin double-immunopositive cells were still
observed. Indeed, a recent study on brain stab lesions in adult zebra-
fish shows that, during the recovery phase, ventricular radial glial
progenitor cells that had proliferated and migrated to the lesion site
contributed to the population of newly generated neurons which
could survive for > 3 months (Kroehne et al., 2011). Spinal cord
motor neurons in zebrafish derive from the progenitor domain and
differentiate into motor neurons by mechanisms that appear to be
highly conserved between mammals and zebrafish (Kimmel et al.,
1994; William et al., 2003; Cheesman et al., 2004; Park et al.,
2004; Reimer et al., 2008). Similarly, we found that MVP expres-
sion is upregulated in motor neurons identified with the marker
Islet-1 after SCI.
MVP is expressed not only in motor neurons but also in TH-
immunoreactive noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons around the
central canal after SCI. Dopaminergic innervation of the spinal cord
is important for locomotion (Sallinen et al., 2009). For example,
MPTP, a neurotoxin ablating TH+ neurons in mammals, destroys
~50% TH+ neurons in larval fish, leading to impairment of their
swimming capacities at 5, 6 and 7 days post-fertilization (Sallinen
et al., 2009). Thus, reinnervation of the caudal spinal cord by axons
regrown from intraspinal TH+ neurons may be important for recov-
ery after SCI, with uninjured spinal intrinsic neurons compensating
for lost synaptic contacts resulting from plasticity of the intraspinal
circuitry caudal to the lesion site.
Upregulation of MVP levels has been reported in the nervous sys-
tem for different injury models and species. For instance, MVP was
found to be upregulated at 7 days after spinal nerve ligation injury
in rats (Komori et al., 2007). In the electric ray, MVP expression is
also increased in neurons following injury (Li et al., 1999). Expres-
sion of MVP is not limited to neurons in the CNS; it is also present
in reactive astrocytes and microglia, which may provide a supportive
and/or hostile microenvironment for regeneration (Prewitt et al.,
1997; Berger et al., 2001; Aronica et al., 2003; Faulkner et al.,
2004; van Vliet et al., 2004).
MVP protein expression was decreased by MO application, lead-
ing to impaired functional recovery as measured by distance swum
at 4–6 weeks after SCI, being most likely at least in part based on
reduced axonal regrowth of injured axons and formation of func-
tional synapses by the regrown axons (Zottoli et al., 1994; Becker
et al., 1997). The axonal contribution to regeneration and locomotor
recovery is associated with an upregulation of MVP expression in
the brain stem comprising the NMLF as shown by microarray analy-
sis (Ma et al., 2012). MVP MO is indeed taken up by axons of
NMLF neurons that are severed by the transection injury and are
therefore considered to be directly affected by the MO treatment.
Thus, the tracing studies reveal the effects of the MO treatment on
both CNS regions in combination – the NMLF neurons into which
the MO is retrogradely transported via the severed axons and the
spinal cord where MOs are taken up by severed and non-severed
cells. Anterograde tracing experiments showed that in the caudal
part of the spinal cord axonal regrowth and number of synapses was
reduced when MVP expression in the spinal cord was reduced.

Retrograde tracing experiments showed that the number of NMLF
neurons projecting beyond the injury site was reduced when MVP
expression in the spinal cord and in the NMLF was reduced. These
combined results support the view that expression of MVP both in
the spinal cord and in the NMLF is beneficial to axon regrowth.
Interestingly, MVP is found not only in axons but also in dendrites
(Paspalas et al., 2009). Thus, not only descending and ascending
axons regrown by several weeks after SCI, but also reformation
and/or reshuffling of dendrites in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion
site may contribute to functional recovery (Becker et al., 1997,
1998, 2004; Hanna et al., 1998; Becker & Becker, 2001; Schweitzer
et al., 2003, 2007). Neurons can axonally transport MVP to accu-
mulate in nerve terminals presynaptically (Herrmann et al., 1996; Li
et al., 1999; Paspalas et al., 2009). Whether MVP also plays a sig-
nificant role in the elaboration of new dendrites and/or reshuffling of
existing ones to new targets after SCI in zebrafish remains to be
seen. The fact that MVP is upregulated in the second response phase
after injury and remains upregulated until 3 weeks after injury (data
not shown, please see Supplemental Fig. 2 in EJN blog) would
favour the interpretation that its major function is not in acute neu-
roprotection after injury by counteracting apoptotic and/or necrotic
cell death, but by sustained neuroprotection and by allowing sup-
raspinal axons to regrow and form synapses, while also allowing
neurons to be generated from ependymoradial glial cells, with their
neurites elaborating to form new synaptic contacts. It is noteworthy
in this context that MOs remain detectable until at least 6 weeks
after application (Becker et al., 2004).
MVP is also considered to be important for cell survival (Schroeij-
ers et al., 2002; Kolli et al., 2004). For example, serum deprivation of
MVP-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) leads to signifi-
cantly increased cell death compared to normal MEFs (Kolli et al.,
2004). MVP enhances expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 in
senescent human fibroblasts (Ryu et al., 2008). Recently, several

MVP promotes spinal cord regeneration 209
studies have shown that MVP modulates cellular signalling pathways
which are related to cell survival and proliferation, pathways such as
the Ras–ERK, PI3K–Akt and JAK–STAT signalling pathways (Kolli
et al., 2004; Minaguchi et al., 2006; Steiner et al., 2006; Berger
et al., 2009). It thus conceivable that MVP is involved not only in
functional recovery after injury but also in maintenance of the cir-
cuitry governing swim behaviour in uninjured fish. The contribution
of MVP-triggered signalling pathways to functional recovery after
SCI in adult zebrafish remains to be studied. Future investigations on
the functions of MVP after SCI in fish and mammals are expected to
yield insights into potential strategies for SCI therapy in humans.
