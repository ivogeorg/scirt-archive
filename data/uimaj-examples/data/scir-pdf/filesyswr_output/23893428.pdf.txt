Spinal cord injury (SCI) in mammals results in functional deficits that are mostly permanent due in part to the 
inability of severed axons to regenerate. Several types of growth-inhibitory molecules expressed at the injury 
site contribute to this regeneration failure. The responses of axons to these inhibitors vary greatly within and 
between organisms, reflecting axons’ characteristic intrinsic propensity for regeneration. In the zebrafish (Danio 
rerio) many but not all axons exhibit successful regeneration after SCi. This review presents and compares the 
intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of axonal regeneration in the injured spinal cord in mammals and zebrafish. 
A better understanding of the molecules and molecular pathways underlying the remarkable individualism 
among neurons in mature zebrafish may support the development of therapies for SCI and their translation to 
the clinic.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCi) in mammals typically results in 
permanent neurological deficits below the level of the 
lesion. Neurological deficits are primarily caused by the 
injury-induced interruption of ascending and descending 
axonal tracts and can be worsened by secondary injury-
related events[1, 2]. in the central nervous system (CNS), 
the distal part of a severed axon undergoes Wallerian 
degeneration, while the proximal part typically retracts to 
some degree and forms a ‘retraction bulb’. Some types 
of neurons are intrinsically unable to re-grow their axons 
after damage, while others do have some intrinsic 
growth ability[3, 4]. However, the regeneration attempts of 
the latter typically fail because, at least in part, of growth-
inhibiting molecules in the milieu of the injury site. The 
balance between intrinsic and extrinsic molecular events 
determines the overall axonal regeneration response. 
A better understanding of this balance may support the 
development and clinical translation of effective therapies 
for SCi that involve axonal regeneration.  
in contrast to the mammalian CNS, axons of 
embryonic neurons, axons in peripheral nervous system 
(PNS), and axons in some non-mammalian species 
regenerate after severance[5-7].  While all these models are 
useful for studying the mechanisms of axon regeneration, 
here we focus on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) due to the 
many recent studies that have elucidated some of the key 
molecules in this process.
In the adult zebrafish, many brainstem neurons are 
able to regenerate axons across an injury in the spinal 
cord and extend caudally[3]. This process is typically 
accompanied by anatomical restoration at the lesion 
site and impressive functional (swimming) recovery[4]. 
interestingly, not all axons that normally project into the 
spinal cord in adult zebrafish regenerate after SCI. The 
mechanisms underlying this remarkable difference between 
zebrafish axons are incompletely understood. Comparison 
Katarina Vajn, et al.    Axonal regeneration after SCI in zebrafish and mammals 403
of the molecules fundamental to this largely variable 
ability to regenerate axons may provide clues about which 
signaling pathways are involved. 
The zebrafish gives us the unique opportunity to 
investigate the individual mechanisms underlying 
successful and failed axon regeneration while extrinsic 
parameters within CNS milieu remain constant. The 
sequencing of the zebrafish genome has provided several 
molecular tools (microarray, next-generation sequencing, 
transgenic animals, morpholinos) to perform functional 
studies that can verify the level of involvement of certain 
molecules and/or pathways in axonal regeneration. in 
addition, the transparency of zebrafish embryos, larvae, 
and the adult Casper strain, enables in vivo studies of 
axonal regeneration using two-photon microscopy, laser 
ablation, and Ca2+ imaging. 
Axonal Regeneration in Mammals
Adult mammalian CNS axons do not spontaneously 
regenerate after a lesion. The mechanisms preventing 
successful regeneration can be environmental (extrinsic) 
or within the axon/neuron (intrinsic). Extrinsic mechanisms 
include the relative lack of growth-promoting molecules 
and/or the surplus of growth-inhibitory molecules expressed 
in the injury milieu. intrinsic mechanisms involve molecules 
expressed within the neuron that limit or prevent regeneration.
Axonal Regeneration in Zebrafish
Adult zebrafish have 20 brainstem nuclei that project 
axons into the spinal cord[3]. Becker and collaborators 
found that after a complete transection at the level of the 
brainstem-spinal cord transition zone, 32–51% of neurons 
in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (NMLF), 
magnocellular octaval nuclei, and intermediate reticular 
nuclei regenerate axons across the lesion and up to 4 
mm into the caudal stump[8]. However, neurons in other 
brainstem nuclei that project into the spinal cord, such 
as the red nucleus, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and 
tangential nucleus, as well as Mauthner neurons and dorsal 
root ganglion neurons, fail to regenerate axons after SCi[9, 10]. 
Molecular Determinants of Axonal Regeneration
Animal experiments have led to the discovery of several 
intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms responsible for the 
axonal regeneration response in the injured CNS. 
Extrinsic Factors Involved in Axonal Regeneration 
in Mammals and Zebrafish
Axonal growth inhibitors bind to receptors on neurons 
and initiate a signaling cascade that leads to regeneration 
failure. There are two major sources of inhibitory molecules 
that prevent axonal regeneration in the injured mammalian 
spinal cord. Scar tissue at the injury site contains reactive 
astrocytes expressing growth-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate 
proteoglycans (CSPGs). Myelin debris at the site of 
injury expresses neurite outgrowth inhibitor A (Nogo-A or 
reticulon-4), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and 
oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (oMgp) (Fig. 1)[11].
CSPGs  The glial scar contains reactive astrocytes that 
create a physical barrier to axonal regeneration. in addition, 
reactive astrocytes secrete CSPGs, which are a diverse 
group of molecules comprised of a core proteoglycan 
with sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. in 
mammals, GAG chains bind to the receptor protein tyrosine 
phosphatase sigma (RPTPσ) and leukocyte common 
antigen-related phosphatase on neurons, resulting in the 
inhibition of axonal regeneration[12, 13]. Depolymerization 
of GAG chains by chondroitinase ABC or inhibition of 
their synthesis using DNA enzymes improves axonal 
regeneration that is accompanied by improved functional 
recovery in rats[14, 15]. in the normal, uninjured mammalian 
CNS, CSPGs with hyaluronan and link proteins form the 
perineuronal net which regulates synaptic stabilization[16]. 
Different types of mammalian neurons are differently 
inhibited by CSPGs in vitro[17] and the composition of 
perineuronal nets differs between neurons[16], resulting 
in variability among neurons in their ability to regenerate 
severed axons. 
The SCI site in zebrafish differs markedly from that 
of mammals. In zebrafish, reactive astrocytes have not 
been observed. After a complete transection, ependymo-
radial glial cells proliferate and extend across the lesion 
site thereby forming a ‘bridge’ between the spinal cord 
stumps[18]. While CSPGs are normally expressed in the 
zebrafish CNS, it is unknown whether their presence is 
increased after injury. However, during regeneration of 
the optic pathway, CSPGs and tenascin-R prevent axons 
from making aberrant connections with neurons in the 
pretectum, demonstrating the ability of zebrafish CSPGs to 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 402–410404
inhibit axonal growth[19].
Nogo-A  Nogo-A is a member of the reticulon family of 
proteins that are mainly found in the endoplasmic reticulum. 
its C-terminus contains two transmembrane hydrophobic 
regions flanking an extracellular hydrophilic loop of 66 
amino-acids (Nogo-66) that inhibits neurite outgrowth in 
mammals by binding to Nogo receptor 1. its N-terminus 
contains another neurite outgrowth inhibitory domain 
termed Nogo-A delta20[20] for which the receptor is currently 
unknown. Nogo-A is expressed in oligodendrocytes, 
immature neurons, and adult neurons in the cortex, 
hippocampus, and dorsal root ganglia[21]. Neuronal Nogo-A 
plays a role in synaptic plasticity and protection against 
reactive oxygen species in mammals[22] and is involved 
in zebrafish PNS axon outgrowth and pathfinding [23]. 
Treatment with anti-Nogo-A antibody leads to axonal 
regeneration and collateral sprouting of spared axons in the 
rat and primate corticospinal and raphespinal tracts[24] and 
this has recently been tested in a Phase i clinical trial (anti-
human Nogo-A antibody ATi355, Novartis Pharma, http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00406016). Anti-Nogo-A 
treatment fails to improve the regeneration of ascending 
sensory axons in adult rats[25]. In zebrafish, Nogo-A lacks 
the N-terminus neurite inhibitory domain (i.e. Nogo-A 
delta20 in mammals). The Nogo-66 sequence in zebrafish, 
in contrast to mammals, is growth-permissive to both 
zebrafish and mouse axons in vitro[26]. 
MAG  MAG is a sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (ig)-
like lectin (Siglec-4) composed of five igG-like domains, 
a transmembrane domain and a shorter or longer 
cytoplasmic domain (S-MAG or L-MAG). The neuronal 
receptors for MAG are the gangliosides GD1a and GT1b 
and Nogo receptors 1 and 2 (NgR1 and NgR2)[27]. Recent 
in vitro experiments revealed the existence of cell-specific 
mechanisms involved in MAG-mediated inhibition of axonal 
regeneration. While cerebellar granule neurons respond 
to MAG mainly through ganglioside-dependent pathways, 
dorsal root ganglion neurons, hippocampal neurons, 
and retinal ganglion cells respond through NgR1/2[28, 29]. 
In zebrafish, MAG is present in myelin in three different 
splice variants and its cytoplasmic tail sequence is largely 
different from mammalian MAG, suggesting that it might 
have different intracellular signaling pathways[30]. The 
axonal outgrowth of cultured zebrafish spinal neurons is 
decreased in the presence of mammalian MAG, however 
similar experiments using zebrafish MAG have not been 
done yet. The same neurons have been shown to express 
NgR[31]. A study by Viljetic et al. showed that neurons in the 
granule cell layer of the zebrafish cerebellum express the 
gangliosides GD1a and GT1b, while Purkinje neurons do 
Fig. 1. Myelin inhibitors of axon regeneration. Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) halts axonal regrowth by binding to the gangliosides 
GD1a or GT1b and/or Nogo receptors 2 and 1 (NgR 2/1). Neurite outgrowth inhibitor A (Nogo-A) contains two axonal outgrowth 
inhibitory domains, Nogo-66 and Nogo-A delta20. The receptor for Nogo-66 is NgR1, while the receptor for Nogo-A delta20 is 
unknown. Oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) inhibits axonal regrowth by binding to NgR as well. 
Katarina Vajn, et al.    Axonal regeneration after SCI in zebrafish and mammals 405
not[32].  it is also worth mentioning that Schwann cells, which 
weakly or do not express Nogo-A and MAG, proliferate and 
remyelinate zebrafish CNS axons after SCI[4].
Although many in vitro and in vivo studies have shown 
the involvement of Nogo-A, MAG, and oMgp in axonal 
regeneration, there are still conflicting results. For instance, 
spinalized triple-mutant mice deficient in Nogo-A,B,C, MAG, 
and oMgp show neither enhanced axonal regeneration 
nor improved functional recovery[33]. it is possible that 
constitutive knockout mice have compensatory mechanisms 
that overcome such a triple deletion. However, inducible 
knockout mice may show enhanced axonal regeneration 
similar to pharmacological inhibition of these inhibitors. 
Further studies of the physiological and developmental 
roles of these molecules are needed to elucidate their 
functions in the CNS.
A direct comparison of mammalian and zebrafish 
extrinsic factors involved in axonal regeneration indicates 
that the CNS in zebrafish is more permissive to axonal 
growth. Still, even with a relatively permissive environment, 
more than half of zebrafish spinal axons do not regenerate 
after SCi. This suggests that the difference in axonal 
regeneration ability between non-regenerating and 
regenerating axons in the adult zebrafish lies in their 
intrinsic propensity for axonal growth.
Intrinsic Factors Involved in Axonal Regeneration 
in Mammals and Zebrafish
When presented with a permissive growth substrate such as 
a Schwann cell-containing peripheral nerve graft or embryonic 
nervous tissue, certain CNS neurons fail to regenerate 
damaged axons, while others regenerate to some degree. 
For instance, Purkinje neurons, but not inferior olive 
neurons, are unable to regenerate axons into an embryonic 
nervous tissue graft[34]. Another study showed that Purkinje 
neurons also fail to regenerate axons into a peripheral 
nerve graft while neurons of the reticular nucleus in the 
thalamus are able to do so[35]. Clearly, axons are intrinsically 
predetermined to grow or not after an injury. Several key 
molecules determine this intrinsic axon growth ability. 
Growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43)   GAP-43 is a 
cytoplasmic protein that can be inserted into membrane 
by palmytoil anchors on cysteines 3 and 4. it is a well-
characterized protein that has been associated with 
successful axonal regeneration in different types of 
neurons and in different species, including mammals[36]. it is 
localized in axonal terminals, and highly expressed during 
CNS development, PNS regeneration, and the regeneration 
of mammalian CNS axons into permissive grafts (Fig. 2). 
In the zebrafish, brainstem nuclei with high regenerative 
capacity express GAP-43 in 84–92% of their neurons at 6 
days post-SCi, while nuclei with low regenerative capacity 
express GAP-43 in 49–63% of their neurons. In the latter 
nuclei, GAP-43 expression decreases dramatically within 
2–3 weeks post-injury[8, 10].
L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM)  L1CAM is an 
axonal transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain 
that contains several immunoglobulin-like domains and 
fibronectin-like repeats (type iii). L1CAM is important for 
Fig. 2. Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) is expressed 
in different types of neurons during successful axonal 
outgrowth. GAP-43 (red circles) is expressed in growth 
cones of: mammalian embryonic neurons in vivo and in vitro (A), 
mammalian peripheral nerve axons during regeneration 
into a Schwann cell canal (green semi-ovals) (B), 
mammalian inferior olivary axons during regeneration into 
an embryonic nervous tissue graft (yellow cylinder) (C), and 
zebrafish nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (NMLF) 
axons during regeneration after spinal cord injury (D). 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 402–410406
CNS development, neuronal migration and differentiation, 
and axonal regeneration[37, 38]. In zebrafish, there are two 
homologs of L1: L1.1 and L1.2. L1.1 is expressed in 84–86% 
of neurons in nuclei of high regenerative capacity and in 
40% of neurons in nuclei of low regenerative capacity[8-10].
Cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1a (CRP1)  in a recent 
study, Ma and colleagues performed a temporal analysis 
using a microarray on the NMLF dissected by laser-capture 
from uninjured and SCI zebrafish[39] and showed increased 
expression of crp1 mRNA after SCi. Several other mRNAs 
were also increased: matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp9), 
suppressor of cytokine signaling 3b (socs3b), gap43, 
contactin-2 and major vault protein (mvp). Quantitative-PCR 
and in situ hybridization validated the increased expression 
of crp1 at 11 days post-SCi. in addition, using two different 
morpholino-knockdown approaches by which the protein 
expression of CRP1 was decreased, the researchers found 
impaired swimming recovery and decreased number of 
axons that regenerated[39]. CRP1 is also known to be up-
regulated during optic nerve regeneration in zebrafish[40]. 
The function of CRP1 appears to be in actin bundling[41] and 
its expression is high in the filopodia of cultured mammalian 
hippocampal neurons[42].
Contactin-2 Contactin-2 (axonin-1, transient axonal 
glycoprotein, TAG-1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-
anchored protein that is either membrane-bound or 
secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid. The membrane-bound 
contactin-2 functions as a cell-adhesion molecule, while 
the soluble form promotes neurite outgrowth from cultured 
mammalian neurons[43]. its expression in adult mouse 
brain is restricted to the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, 
which suggests that it might play a role in plasticity-
related events within the CNS[44]. Microarray revealed 
increased expression of contactin-2 mRNA in zebrafish 
NMLF neurons after SCi[38], which was further verified by 
qPCR and morpholino-mediated knockdown of contactin-2 
mRNA, which caused decreased bulbo-spinal axonal 
regeneration[45].
Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)  Deletion of 
SoCS3 in adult mouse retinal ganglion neurons improves 
axonal regeneration[46]. SoCS3 negatively regulates the 
gp130-dependent JAK/STAT pathway, and when gp130 
is deleted the effects of SoCS3 deletion are abolished, 
indicating that SoCS3 is a major intrinsic mechanism 
that limits successful axonal regeneration. interestingly, 
microarray analysis by Ma and colleagues showed that 
expression of socs3b mRNA is increased in the NMLF after 
SCI in zebrafish. So far functional studies have not been 
performed[39]. 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway  Recently, it was demonstrated 
that deletion of the phosphatase and tensin homolog 
(PTEN) gene improves axonal regeneration and prevents 
apoptosis in mouse retinal ganglion neurons. PTEN is a 
known inhibitor of the Pi3K/AKT/mToR pathway. Direct 
inhibition of mToR by rapamycin abolishes the effects 
of PTEN deletion in retinal ganglion neurons[47]. In vivo 
experiments have shown that PTEN deletion leads to 
sprouting and regeneration in the mouse corticospinal 
tract and dorsal root ganglion neurons[48, 49]. During 
development, the expression of mToR decreases in most 
retinal ganglion neurons, and axotomy further decreases 
its expression, suggesting that inactivation of mToR is a 
major intrinsic mechanism that limits axonal regeneration. 
one of the functions of mToR is the regulation of protein 
synthesis which is needed after axotomy to synthesize 
new organelles (cytoskeleton) in the extending axon. in 
zebrafish, the functions of PTEN and mTOR in axonal 
regeneration have not been studied.
Major vault protein (MVP)  MVP is part of a vault 
cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein, which is an organelle 
with a somewhat elusive function in eukaryotic cells. 
The vaults are involved in the transport of mRNA from 
nucleus to cytoplasm[50]. MVP accounts for 75% of the 
total vault complex which contains small un-translated 
vault RNA, telomerase-associated protein-1 and vault poly 
(ADP-ribose) polymerase. In zebrafish spinal cord, the 
expression of MVP mRNA and protein increases at six and 
11 days post-SCI as evidenced by microarray, qPCR and 
immunohistochemistry. Knockdown by morpholino against 
mvp mRNA decreased MVP protein expression in spinal 
cord tissue, impaired swimming recovery, reduced bulbo-
spinal axonal regeneration, and caused fewer synapses 
below the SCi site[51]. MVP is up-regulated in dorsal root 
ganglion neurons after spinal nerve ligation in rats[52] as well 
as in neurons of the electric ray following injury[53]. MVP 
has been shown to regulate the Pi3K/Akt and JAK–STAT 
pathways in cancer cells[54, 55]. These pathways are involved 
in the intrinsic inhibition of axonal regeneration in mammals 
(see above). it would be of great interest to investigate 
whether MVP influences these pathways during axonal

regeneration in the zebrafish after SCI. 
miR-133b  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding 
RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by modifying 
translation and mRNA degradation. A single miRNA can 
have multiple target mRNAs and a single mRNA can have 
multiple targeting miRNAs. Recently, Yu et al. found that 
miR-133b is expressed in the NMLF, superior reticular 
formation, intermediate reticular formation, magnocellular 
octaval nuclei and spinal grey matter in normal zebrafish[56]. 
At one and seven days post-SCi, the number of NMLF 
neurons expressing miR-133b increases 5–6 times as 
compared to sham-injured fish. Morpholino-mediated 
knockdown of miR-133b expression decreases the number 
of NMLF neurons exhibiting axonal regeneration and 
increases RhoA expression. in rat, miR-133b expression is 
up-regulated at 4 h but dramatically decreases at one day 
post-SCi[57]. There are several targets in the mammalian 
CNS for miR-133b including RhoA[58], calcineurin[59] and 
caspase-9[60] which play different roles in regeneration. 
Rho GTPase is involved in axonal growth inhibition; a RhoA 
inhibitor is currently being tested in phase i/iia clinical trials 
for SCi[61]. Calcineurin and caspase-9 are pro-apoptotic 
molecules and their inhibition results in improved functional 
recovery after spinal cord and brain trauma[62, 63].
Axonal regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS is 
limited even when certain inhibitors of axonal regrowth 
are removed. Study is further complicated by the fact 
that not all neurons respond the same way to treatment. 
The zebrafish offers a unique opportunity to study the 
differences between successful and unsuccessful axonal 
regeneration while the extrinsic factors are constant. 
The expression of GAP-43 and L1CAM is higher in 
highly-regenerative brainstem nuclei in zebrafish than 
in low-regenerative nuclei, which is similar to certain 
mammalian neurons presented with a permissive 
substrate. Recent studies in zebrafish have revealed 
several new intrinsic factors involved in successful axonal 
regeneration, such as CRP1, contactin-2, MVP and miR-
133b, whose functions in mammalian neurons need to be 
further investigated. 
Lessons Learned from Zebrafish That Can Be 
Applied to Mammalian SCI
A typical spinal cord contusion damages axonal pathways 
originating from different nuclei in the brain. The neurons 
vary in how their signaling pathways respond to axonal 
growth-inhibitors in the injury milieu[28, 29] and have different, 
unique, intrinsic axonal growth properties [34, 35] (Fig. 3). 
A better understanding of the individual characteristics 
of neurons with regard to their regenerative propensity 
may point at the necessity for interventions in more 
common mechanisms or multiple interventions in separate 
mechanisms to achieve significant axonal regeneration 
and thus functional restoration after SCi. Studies of axonal 
regeneration-competent organisms such as zebrafish 
contribute to elucidating common and unique molecules 
and molecular pathways involved in successful and failed 
axonal regeneration after SCi.
About 30–50% of brainstem neurons in zebrafish 
regenerate axons after a complete spinal cord transection 
and this results in basic locomotor (swimming) recovery. 
Fig. 3. Differential mechanisms involved in axonal regeneration. 
Most axons are inhibited from regenerating by a 
combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors (A). 
Elimination of extrinsic inhibitors alone is sufficient to 
promote regeneration of certain axons (B), while others 
require up-regulation of growth-associated molecules 
(GAMs) (C) or a combination of up-regulation of GAMs 
and down-regulation of growth-inhibitory molecules 
(GIMs) along with elimination of extrinsic inhibitors for 
successful regeneration (D). CSPGs, chondroitin-sulfate

Most axons, including ascending axons, fail or do not 
attempt to regenerate. Comprehensive answers about 
what is necessary for functional repair and if there is 
any reorganization of neuronal circuitry that contributes 
to functional repair will most likely come from a better 
understanding of the mechanisms crucial for regeneration 
as well as those for failed and no regeneration. Studies 
revealing the gene and protein expression profiles in axon 
populations with different regenerative responses following 
SCi are important in providing target genes/molecules for 
the design of future therapies. 
The zebrafish is an excellent model in which to study 
the mechanisms underlying successful and failed axonal 
regeneration after SCi. Due to embryo transparency, the 
zebrafish has been established as a model of vertebrate 
development for several decades and sequencing of 
its genome has made many molecular tools available, 
including morpholinos, transgenic fish, and microarrays/ 
next-generation sequencing. A recent study by Goldshmit 
and colleagues used different techniques, including 
transgenic zebrafish and time-lapse imaging, to study 
the influence of fibroblast growth factor signaling on 
the formation of the glial cell bridge and its association 
with regenerating axons[18]. This is a nice example of 
how currently-available zebrafish research tools can 
help in unraveling the mechanisms that drive successful 
anatomical recovery after SCi. Similar tools can be used 
to discover mechanisms that determine the individual 
characteristics of zebrafish neurons in their propensity for 
axonal regeneration after CNS injury as well as the extent 
of functional repair controlled by supraspinal pathways. 
Subsequently, such information may lead to an improved 
understanding of axonal regeneration responses in the 
mammalian spinal cord and serve to develop effective 
therapies for SCi.
