Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious injury of the
nervous system that can lead to paralysis and urinary
and fecal incontinence. Several factors are thought to
contribute to the lack of regeneration of spinal cord
axons, including a reduction in the intrinsic growth
capacity of adult central nervous system projection
neurons, the presence of inhibitory cues derived from
restoration of spinal injury (1,2). Yang et al. (3) trans-
planted human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
(UC-MSCs) into the lesion site of the rats with co-
mplete spinal cord transection. Significant improve-
ments in locomotion were observed that were
accompanied by increased numbers of regenerated
axons in the corticospinal tract and neurofilament-
positive fibers around the lesion site. Hypotheses as toClinical analysis of the treatment o

entiate in vitro into bone, cartilage, adipose tissue
(10,11), skeletal muscle cells (12), cardiomyocytes
(13,14), endothelium (15) and especially neural cells
(7,16e18). The cells possess a potential therapeutic
role for treating patients with neurodegenerative
diseases and central nervous system injuries. Shetty
et al. (19) compared the MSCs from BM, UC and
UC blood and found these cells all expressed CD73,
CD105, SSEA4, CD29, CD44 and HLA-A, HLA-B
and HLA-C. UC-MSCs and UC blood MSCs did
not express HLA-DR associated with transplant
rejection and could maintain the capacity of multi-
lineage differentiation during in vitro culture. We
used UC-MSCs in the present study. In this study,
we observed the therapeutic effect of cell therapy
with UC-MSCs by intrathecal injection in 22 patients
with SCI.
Methods
Patients
We recruited 22 patients (17 men and five women,
average age 33 years) with SCI at our hospital from
January 2008 to October 2010. Four patients had
cervical cord injuries, two patients had cervical cord
and thoracic cord injuries, seven patients had
thoracic cord injuries, two patients had thoracic cord
and lumbar cord injuries and seven patients had
lumbar cord injuries. The average time from injury to
participation in the study was 56 months (range,
2e204 months). The causes of injury included motor
vehicle accident (eight cases), a fall from a height
(eight cases), a crush injury (2), diving accident (two
cases), tethered cord syndrome (one case) andgrowth factors and cytokines and improved vasculari-
zation, providing a permissive growth substrate or
suppressing cavity formation, or both (4e6). These
different mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and
numerous mechanisms could contribute to improved
outcomes.
MSCs can be isolated from bone marrow (BM),
umbilical cord (UC) and UC blood. The frequency of
MSCs obtained from BM aspirates is about 0.01%.
BM aspiration and ex vivo expansion of MSCs for
about 3 weeks are needed to obtain MSCs from BM.
Crucial points to isolate MSCs from UC blood are
a time from collection to isolation, a net volume of
UC blood and a mononuclear cell count. In 2003,
Mitchell et al. (7) first identified MSCs from human
UCWhartonâ€™s jelly. It was reported that human UC-
MSCs have greater ex vivo expansion capabilities,

sub-cultivation was performed. The cells were
passaged, and cells at passage 3 (about 21 days of
culture) were used for therapy after phenotypic anal-
ysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS-
Calibur flow cytometer; BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ USA) and differentiation assays (Figures 1
and 2). Bacterial and fungal cultivation of themedium
was performed 48 h before cell harvesting.
Clinical use of UC-MSCs
Lumbar punctures were performed after patients
6patients, and informed consents were signed. The
therapeutic regimen was approved by hospital Ethics
Committee and Technology Committee. Before
receiving MSC therapy, patients underwent
a comprehensive evaluation including physical exam-
ination, electrocardiogram, magnetic resonance
imaging of the spinal cord, complete blood count,
biochemistry and hemostasis tests. No fever or infec-
tion was present in any of the patients, and all patients
had normal function of the heart, lung, liver, kidney
and hematologic system.
UC-MSC preparation
All parts of this study, especially the isolation of the
human UC, were performed according to the Decla-
ration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained
from the General Hospital of Air Force (Beijing,
China), and written informed consent was obtained
fromUC donors. UC-MSCs were uniformly cultured
in the StemCellCenter ofAir ForceGeneralHospital.
Cells from different UCs were sampled for immuno-
phenotypic analysis and differentiation assays. MSC
preparation was performed as previously reported (7).
Briefly, UCs were collected after obtaining signed
written informed consent and microbiologic detec-
tion. Each human UC was collected from full-term
cesarean section births and processed within 3e6 h.
Umbilical arteries and veins were removed, and the
remaining tissue was diced into small fragments.
Equal volume of 0.2% collagenase I was added, and
the digestion was carried out at 37C overnight. The
next day, double volume of 0.05% trypsin was added
andmaintained for 1 h at 37C.Cellswere collected by
centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. Viable cellswith MSCs (e.g., fever, lumbago, headache, dizzi-

During a period of 1 month after therapy, fever,
lumbago, headache, dizziness and other adverse reac-
tions were observed. If there were no obvious adverse
effects, the patients were discharged at 1 month.
Follow-up
Because the patients lived all over China, follow-upwas
done by telephone. Patients were asked to report regu-
larly to local departments of neurology for a systemic
assessment to assess their disease, immune function
and MSC-associated adverse effects including tumor.
At the time of this writing, the patients were still being
followed.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by matching t test. P values
<0.05 were considered statistically significant using
a commercially available software package (SPSS,
version 11.5 Bizinsight Information Technology
Co., Beijing, China).
Results
Clinical symptoms were improved in 13 cases with
total effective rate of 59.1%. Of these 13 patients, five
patients underwent further treatment with UC-MSCs,
and the clinical symptoms were further improved.
Improvements in motor function, sensory function and
the controllability of defecation were noted (Table I).

Among sixpatientswithmyelomalacia in injuredparts of
the spinal cord, no improvements were observed in five
cases. Two of these cases were incomplete SCI, and
three cases were complete SCI.
The average time from injury to treatment in
13 patients whose clinical symptomswere improvedwas
59 months (range, 2e204 months). The average time
from injury to treatment in the remaining nine patients
whose clinical symptoms were not improved was
51 months (range, 4e136 months). There was no
significant difference in the time of injury between these
two groups (P > 0.05). (Table IV).
Adverse reactions and complications
The vital signs of all patients were stable during UC-
MSC therapy. One patient experienced lumbago, and
one experienced headache. These symptoms dis-
appeared 1e3 days later without special handling. No
fever or other side effects were recorded.
Results of follow-up
All of our patients receivedMSC therapy in the chronic
stage of SCI and were neurologically stable 1 month
before cell implantation. Among 13 patients whose
clinical symptoms were improved, there were no further
improvements in nine patients 1 month after UC-MSC
treatment, 3months after treatment in threepatients and
1 year after treatment in one patient. No severe adverse
reactions were observed in any of the patients.

190 J. Liu et al.transmits ascending sensory information to the brain
and descending motor information to the body, injury
to the spinal cord has devastating consequences and
often results in permanent loss of motor or sensory
function, or both, below the site of injury. SCI can be
caused by disease and external injury, which accounts
for about 90% of SCIs. In this study, 20 patients
had SCI caused by external injuries, most of which
involved motor vehicle accidents and falls from
a height.
Current treatments for SCI include surgery to
stabilize the injury site, high doses of corticosteroids
to help limit secondary injury processes and reha-
bilitative care. Although these treatment options may
provide benefits, clinical improvements are modest,
and many patients still face significant neurologic
dysfunction and disability. UC-MSCs are easily
obtained from UC and able to expand rapidly ex
vivo. Studies have shown that MSCs are of low
immunogenicity, have mutilineage differentiation
capacity and can secrete various bioactive molecules
that can promote the reparative process of neural
tissues (3,21,22). In addition, there are no ethical
issues with the use of MSCs. MSCs have potential
efficacy in restoring central lesions.
Studies of MSCs in the treatment of SCI are
mostly limited to animal experiments. There are few
clinical studies of MSCs in the treatment of SCI. Pal
et al. (23) transplanted autologous BM-MSCs in
30 patients with SCI via lumbar puncture at a dose of
1  106 cells/kg. None of the patients reported any
adverse events associated with BM-MSC trans-
plantation in the 3 years of follow-up. A patient who
sustained a crush fracture of the L1 vertebral body
received stem cell therapy that comprised intrathecal
administration of allogeneic UC blood ex vivo ex-
panded CD34Ã¾ and UC matrix MSCs at 5 months,
8 months and 14 months after injury. Recovery of
muscle, bowel and sexual function was noted, and no
adverse effects were observed (24).
We applied UC-MSC therapy by intrathecal
injection to 22 patients with SCI. The clinical

Many experimental studies have been performed
to find the optimal period for cell transplantation. To
avoid the destruction of transplanted cells by the
inflammatory process in the acute phase (<1 week),
many researchers consider the subacute phase from
10e14 days as an optimal period for cell trans-
plantation (25). Results from animal studies show
that significant gliosis is a major obstacle inhibiting
axonal regeneration during the chronic stage. All of
our patients accepted MSC therapy in the chronic
stage. There was no significant difference in the time
from injury to MSC treatment between patients whose
clinical symptoms were improved and patients whose
symptoms were not improved. These results indicate
that the optimal period of MSC transplantation in
patients with SCI should not be restricted to <2 weekset al. Comparison of immunomodulatory properties of
