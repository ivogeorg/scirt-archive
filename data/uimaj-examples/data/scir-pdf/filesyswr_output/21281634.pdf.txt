remyelination in cell transplant studies. In this review we discuss the migration and remyelination properties
of OECs transplanted into various demyelinating lesion environments including conditions when
inflammation is active and when it is largely subsided. While sharing many common properties, comparisons
of the in vivo fate between OECs and SCs suggest unique properties of OECs as compared to SCs. A
complicating factor in the assessment of experimental remyelination by transplantation of myelin-forming
cells in general is the rapidity of endogenous myelin repair in most rodent models of demyelination.
Alternative persistent demyelination models are discussed as potential tools to study both the competency of
chronic demyelinated axons for remyelination and the remyelination potential of cells such as human
progenitors that require longer times to mobilize and remyelinate axons. This article is part of a Special Issue

vivo microenvironment (Ramón-Cueto and Avila, 1998; Chuah and
West, 2002; Au and Roskams, 2003; Oudega and Xu, 2006). Thus,
while of different embryonic origin both cell types have remarkable
similarity in terms of their molecular markers. Yet, several unique
properties of OECs have been described (Boyd et al., 2006; Franssen
et al., 2008; Lankford et al., 2008) suggesting that their in vivo
behavior may differ in some conditions from SCs (Kocsis et al., 2009).
Transplantation of myelin-forming cells such as OECs, SCs and
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) can remyelinate acute demy-
elinating lesions induced by chemical agents such as lysolecithin or
ethidium bromide (EB) in the rat spinal cord (Blakemore and Crang,
1985; Franklin et al., 1996; Honmou et al., 1996, Imaizumi et al., 1998,
Kato et al., 2000; Akiyama et al., 2004; Sasaki et al., 2006a; Tetzlaff
et al., 2010 review). Chemically induced demyelination in rodent
spinal cord is followed by relatively rapid (within a few weeks) and
robust remyelination by either endogenous OPCs or SCs (Black et al.,
2006). This robust endogenous remyelinationpotential in the rodent is
problematic for cell transplantation studies to study the myelinating
potential of a particular cell type because the transplanted cells will
compete with endogenous progenitor cells.
Blakemore and Crang (1985) developed a novel demyelination
model to provide for amore persistent demyelinating lesion in the rat.
In this model several centimeters of rat spinal cord are X-irradiated
and a few days later a focal injection of EB is applied to the dorsal
funiculus (Honmou et al., 1996; Sasaki et al., 2006a). The irradiation
kills NG2+ OPCs (Blakemore and Patterson, 1978) and the EB chelates
nucleic acids and kills both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes within
the injection site. An aglial demyelinating lesion is formed and
persists for 6–8 weeks. This X-EB lesion model is useful for studying
the fate of transplanted myelin-forming cells because the competition
with endogenous cells is eliminated for up to a couple of months
rather days or weeks. With time OPCs or SCs outside of the
X-irradiation field will repopulate the lesion site and remyelinate
the axons.
Talbott et al. (2006) grafted OPCs into the X-EB lesioned spinal
cord; the OPCs differentiated into Schwann cell-like peripheral
myelinating cells. However, when OPCs were grafted along with
astrocytes, a natural source of noggin that inhibits bone morpho-
genetic protein (BMP) signaling in vivo, P0+ myelin was not found.
Some grafted cells at the edge of the lesion differentiated into central
myelinating MBP+ cells. Talbott et al. (2006) further demonstrated
that inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling
through noggin overexpression by engrafted adult OPCs is sufficient
to block SC-like differentiation within this lesion and concluded that
SC-like differentiation of OPCs derived from adult spinal cord is BMP
dependent.
The literature regarding the survival, remyelinating potential and
functional outcome of acutely transplanted OECs in the injured spinal
cord is controversial. There aremany claims of axonal regeneration that
cannot be confirmed independently by others (Tetzlaff et al., 2010). As
Tetzlaff et al. (2010) discussed, the reasons for these discrepancies are
not fully understood, although experimental bias, variability of the cell
sources and culture conditions, and animal or injury model systems are
all likely contributing factors. Boyd et al. (2004) reported the failure of
fetal-derived OECs to myelinate axons in vivo. They did not find LacZ-
expressing cells after transplantation of embryonic day 18-derived rat
Lax Z-expressing OECs into a spinal cord compression injury model, but
only LacZ-expressing fibroblast-like cells. They concluded that only
fibroblast-like cells are derived from the OEC transplantation and that
the SC-like cells are derived exclusively from invading SCs, suggesting
contaminating SCs may be responsible for the remyelination reported
by others. These investigators also claim that OECs, but not SCs, express
themuscle fiber actin binding protein calponin (Boyd et al., 2006; Rizek
and Kawaja. 2006; Jahed et al., 2007), and thatmost cells in OEC culture
+ −preparations are p75 and calponin , thus suggesting a contaminationin OEC cultures with Schwann cells. Recent counter studies by Franklin
and colleagues, however, clearly demonstrated that calponin was
present in the olfactory fibroblast meningeal cells, but not in adult
OECs in rodent (Ibanez et al., 2007) and canine (Ito et al., 2008), thus
strengthening the argument that remyelination following OEC trans-
plantation was not the result of SC contamination. We observed
remyelination by eGFP-OECs transplanted into a dorsal transection
(Sasaki et al., 2004), a contusive SCI lesion (Sasaki et al., 2007), and into
transected peripheral nerve where they remyelinated regenerated
sciatic nerve axons (Dombrowski et al., 2006; Radtke et al., 2009). Thus,
OECs have the ability to remyelinate axons in a number of chemically
and trauma-induced models of axonal injury. Moreover we observed
recovery of locomotor motor function after several weeks of
acute OEC transplantation into dorsal transection model (Sasaki et al.,
2004).
Although delayed transplantation of OECs into various SCI models
including transection (Ramón-Cueto et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2002;
López-Vales et al., 2006; López-Vales et al., 2007; Sasaki et al., 2004),
contusion (Plant et al., 2003; Sasaki et al., 2007) and electrolytic lesions
(Keyvan-Fouladi et al., 2003) elicits axonal regeneration and functional
recovery, delayed transplantation of OECs after demyelinating lesion
induction is less well studied. Cell transplantation for myelination has
been largely carried out in development (Duncan et al., 1997 review) and
actively demyelinating lesions (Blakemore and Crang, 1985; Franklin et
al., 1996; Honmou et al., 1996, Imaizumi et al., 1998, Kato et al., 2000;
Akiyama et al., 2004; Sasaki et al., 2006a; Talbott et al., 2006),
environments considered optimal for myelination or remyelination
(Foote and Blakemore, 2005).
A key question has been raised as to whether stably demyelinated
axons remain competent for remyelination (Setzu et al., 2004; Foote
and Blakemore, 2005). Setzu et al. (2004) demonstrated that
transplantation of OPCs into the nerve fiber layer of the retina,
where axons are normally unmyelinated, are ectopically myelinated
by the transplanted OPCs even in older rats, thus suggesting that at
least in this system myelination can be achieved on long term
unmyelinated axons. Interestingly, myelination of these retinal axons
was enhanced by acute inflammation (Setzu et al., 2006; Zhao et al.,
2005; Dubois-Dalcq et al., 2008). Foote and Blakemore (2005) found
poor myelination after OPC transplantation into the spinal cord of a
late onset chronically demyelinating rat mutant (taiep), but more
extensive remyelination when local inflammation was induced
suggesting that inflammation may facilitate cell transplant-induced
remyelination. Taken together these experimental studies suggest
that inflammatory signaling may assist in remyelination. The role of
inflammation in remyelination has critical implications for remyeli-
nating cell transplantation studies. In this review we describe
remyelination by OECs as a model myelinating cell type in different
pathological environments. Themodels are well defined experimental
models and caution must be exercised in extrapolation to human
demyelinating disorders which present with unique pathological
environments.
Inflammatory status of the X-EB demyelinating lesion
The X-EB lesion described above displays hallmark signs of
inflammation in the acute phase of the lesion (3 days post-EB injection).

(Fig. 1G). The ED1+ cellswere abundant and confined to the lesion zone

(acute) lesion and after the inflammation has abated (subacute) in
the X-EB lesion
In this model system OECs were transplanted in the acute (3 day;
Sasaki et al., 2006a) and in the subacute (3 week) phases after lesion
induction to determine if themyelinating potential differed depending
on inflammation status. The transplanted OECs from donor GFP rats
(GFP-OECs) were easily distinguished from endogenous cells in the
subacute X-EB lesion 3 weeks after transplantation by their green
fluorescence (Fig. 3A1). GFAP immunostaining indicated a near
absence of astrocytes within the lesion site, but intense GFAP staining
was observed at the outer boundary of the lesion zone (Fig. 3A2 and B).
Immunostaining for P0, a specific marker of peripheral myelin
(Greenfield et al., 1973), was present in the transplant site (Fig. 3C).
Higher power images of the transplant site showed that P0 was
associated with most of the GFP-OECs and was surrounded by GFP-
OEC cytoplasm, indicating that peripheral-type myelin was formed by
the transplanted cells within the dorsal column lesion (Fig. 3C). The

Semi-thin azure II-methylene blue-stained plastic sections demon-
strated virtually all axons were remyelinated in the dorsal funiculus 3
weeks after transplantation into the acute lesion (Fig. 4A–C).When cells
were transplanted into the subacute lesion (3 weeks post-lesion
induction) there was considerable remyelination 3 weeks after
transplantation, but it was much less thanwhen the cells were injected
in the acute phase (Fig. 4D–F). Note the numerous remaining
demyelinating axons in Fig. 4F. These data do not prove, but strongly
support the suggestion that inflammation may not only have a role in
demyelination, but may also contribute to remyelination. Thus,
inflammation may facilitate remyelination in the CNS by the peripheral
myelin-forming OECs as well as OPCs.

have led directly from investigations using EAE (Pluchino et al., 2003).
The multi-focal nature of demyelination and inflammation in general-
ized EAEmodelsmakes it challenging toprecisely target a lesion site and
to assess the response to a cell therapy intervention. An important study
by Kerschensteiner et al. (2004) reported a novel focal EAE animal
model that produced an inflammatory demyelinating lesion in the
spinal cord. After inducing subclinical sensitization with MOG, they
microinjected a “cocktail” of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ,

to those seen in generalized EAE.
Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a critical event in the
pathogenesis of MS. Imaging studies indicate that breakdown of the
BBB is observed for both new inflammatory lesion formation and
reactivation of older ones (Miller et al., 1988; Kermode et al., 1990).
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a well-known mediator
of angiogenesis (Carmeliet et al., 1996; Ferrara et al., 1996). However,
in the CNS, it is a pro-inflammatory signal that has the ability to
transiently and non-traumatically open the BBB (Dobrogowska et al.,
1998; Proescholdt et al., 2002). When VEGF is microinjected into the
dorsal funiculus of the spinal cord of Lewis rats that have been
sensitized with the encephalitogenic antigen, recombinant rat MOG
(1–125), a focal inflammatory demyelinating lesion with the
histological appearance of EAE is produced (Sasaki et al., 2010).
Thus, transient breakdown of the BBB in MOG-sensitized rats is a
sufficient condition to induce focal EAE.
In this model system clinical signs were apparent within 72 h and
were largely resolved by day 21. The pathology at the injection site
consistedof a focal region containingOX-42+cells, phagocytic cellswith
debris, extensive demyelination, and some lymphocyte infiltration
(Fig. 5A–C). However, similar to chemically demyelinating lesions
extensive remyelination was observed within a few weeks (Fig. 5D–F)
making it difficult to assess the impact of cell transplantation on
remyelination in this inflammatory lesion because of the competition
with endogenous progenitors.
It is important to note that a series of studies indicate that pro-
inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α promote OPC proliferation and
remyelination (Mason et al., 2001; Arnett et al., 2003). Kotter et al.(2005) found that depletion of macrophages induced impairment of
remyelination and a reduction in OPC responsiveness and altered
growth factor expression. The relative role of inflammation in assisting
remyelination inEAE is not yet known;however, ourpreliminary results
show that acutely transplanted GFP-OECs derived from GFP-expressing
Lewis rat olfactory bulb survived and migrated several millimeters in
this model system 6 weeks after transplantation (Fig. 5G–I).

Although OECs and SCs share many morphological, antigenic, and
proliferative characteristics (Ramón-Cueto and Avila, 1998; Wewet-
zer et al., 2002), several studies suggest a greater potential for OECs to
migration within the CNS (Bartolomei and Greer, 2000; Lakatos and
Franklin, 2002; Franklin, 2002; Lu and Ashwell, 2002). OECs distribute
more freely with co-cultured astrocytes than SCs (Lakatos et al., 2000,
Van den Pol and Santarelli, 2003), are less adhesive in astrocyte
monolayers (Fairless et al., 2005), have less of an inductive effect on
astrocytic hypertrophy (Lakatos et al., 2000) in vitro, and elicit smaller
increases in GFAP and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan expression
after transplantation than SCs (Lakatos et al., 2003; García-Alías et al.,
2004; Andrews and Stelzner, 2007). Like SCs, OECs phagocytize
cellular debris after injury in vivo (Chuah et al., 1995; Lankford et al.,
2008) or in vitro (Wewetzer et al., 2005), but unlike SCs, OECs also
exhibit microglia-like cytokine responses to bacterial proteins
(Vincent et al., 2007). Together these observations imply that OECs
produce a more complex array of responses to local environmental
conditions.
Are there differences in migration properties between SCs and
OECs in vivo? When transplanted into chemically demyelinated
lesions in the spinal cord, both OECs and SCs migrate and myelinate
axons within the lesion site (Blakemore, 1977; Harrison, 1980;
Honmou et al., 1996; Kato et al., 2000; Franklin, 2003; Akiyama
et al., 2004; Sasaki et al., 2006a,b). However, OECs, SCs and OPCs show
poor survival and migration after transplantation into normal white
matter (Franklin et al., 1996; O'Leary and Blakemore, 1997; Iwashita
et al., 2000; Hinks et al., 2001; Lankford et al., 2008). An interesting
93M. Sasaki et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 88–98observation was made by Hinks et al. (2001) who demonstrated that
focal X-irradiation of the spinal cord a week prior to transplantation
facilitates migration of OPCs, but the X-irradiation does not facilitate
migration of SCs (Iwashita et al., 2000; Lankford et al., 2008). The OPCs
migrated extensively throughout both white and grey matter in the
spinal cord. The dosage of X-irradiation used in these studies does not
produce obvious gross structural changes in the spinal cord over the
course of the study nor are there obvious functional deficits, but NG2+
OPCs are killed in the X-irradiation zone. The precise changes induced
by the irradiation that provide for a permissive environment for the
enhanced migration of OPCs are not known. Hinks et al. (2001)
suggested that killing of endogenous OPCs by the X-irradiation opens
structural niches to which the transplanted OPCs can migrate.
While SCs do not migrate in the normal or X-irradiated spinal cord
(Iwashita et al., 2000; Lankford et al., 2008), we recently found that
OECs migrate extensively in both white and grey matter of the
X-irradiated spinal cord similarly to OPCs (Lankford et al., 2008). This
behavior indicates a fundamental difference in the in vivo behavior of
OECs as compared to SCs.Within theX-irradiated spinal cord, theOECs
appeared randomly distributed within their area of dispersion. The
cells had relatively small cell bodies (less than 25 μm) and gave rise to

were p75+, the distributed cells were p75− suggesting a phenotypic
change in vivo. Interestingly the OECs showedweakOX-42 staining on
their processes and were phagocytic, and phagocytic debris was
present in electron micrographs of identified GFP-expressing OECs
that have been transplanted into the X-irradiated spinal cord
(Lankford et al., 2008). The OECs might migrate to areas of killed
OPCs and phagocytize these cells. This possibility is supported by the
observation that there is no clear cell loss other than the OPCs
following the irradiation protocol. These results also demonstrate a
clear difference between the in vivo properties of OEC and SC
populations.
OECs transplanted into the X-irradiated spinal cord can repair
subsequently demyelinated axons
Experimental cell transplantation approaches to improve function
after SCI or demyelination typically apply cells after lesion induction.We
asked the question as to whether OECs could be “pre-loaded” into the
X-irradiated spinal cord and if they would respond to subsequent
myelin injury (Lankford et al., 2008). The spinal cords were irradiated
nment. Remyelination is extensive 3 weeks after transplantation of OECs into an acute
transplantation into a subacute lesion when inflammation is reduced (D–F). Scale

(day 7). While SCs do not migrate in the X-irradiated spinal cord, OECs
migrate extensively in both white and grey matter of the X-irradiated
spinal cord after 3 weeks of OEC transplantation (day 28) (Lankford et
al., 2008).Wemade a small focal demyelinating lesionbymicroinjection
of EB into the dorsal funiculus (day 28), a time point when the OECs are
dispersed throughout white and grey matter (“pre-loaded”). Three
weeks after EB injection (day 42), the spinal cords were studied
histologically. Interestingly, the GFP identified OECs remyelinated host
axons with a peripheral-like pattern of myelin. Thus under these
experimental conditions theOECs couldbe “pre-loaded” into a relatively
intact spinal cord, and then mobilize for myelin repair when lesions
were induced several weeks later. SCs do not survive well or migrate in
the X-irradiated spinal cord. These results revealed a clear difference
between the migratory properties of OECs and SCs in the X-irradiated

In co-transplant experiments in which a mixture (1:1) of GFP-
expressing “green” rat SCs was co-transplanted with wild type OECs
into X-irradiated spinal cords, we observed minimal dispersion of
GFP-expressing “green” SCs 3 weeks post-transplantation (Fig. 6A),
compared with a much broader dispersion of “green” OECs co-
transplanted with wild type SCs (Fig. 6B). These results indicate the
two key points: 1) OECs have unique migratory properties and 2) SC
contamination in our cultures cannot account for the migratory and
myelination properties of the OECs (Lankford et al., 2008).
Clearly X-irradiating the spinal cord and transplanting cells in
anticipation of a subsequent disease such as MS plaques is not
feasible. But one might consider such an approach when the spinal

Myelin competency of chronically demyelinated axons
There are few adult animalmodel systems to study themyelinating
potential of transplanted myelin-forming cells in persistent long term
demyelinated spinal cord. The rodent model developed by Blakemore
and Crang (1985) and described above does allow for a window of
6–8 weeks of persistent demyelination. However, some human cell
types such as OPCs require months to remyelinate after transplanta-
tion (Windrem et al., 2004), so even this model system does not have
the appropriate temporal range to study efficacy of certain human cell
types. In several other chemically or virally induced demyelinated
models or EAEmodels in rodent, robust remyelination occurs within a
fewweeks after lesion induction. The focal EAE lesionmodel described
above results in extensive acute demyelination in the dorsal funiculus,
but endogenous remyelination is prominent at 3 weeks thus limiting
the models’ usefulness to study transplanted myelin-forming cells
because of competition with endogenous cells. Given that clinical
studies in SCI patients (Féron et al., 2005; Lima et al., 2006, 2010;
Mackay-Sim et al., 2008) have been initiated using human OECs as a
potential cell therapy, axo–glial interactions of human OECs in
chronically demyelinated axons are important.
Cell transplantation studies performed using human OPCs into the
dysmyelinating mutant Shiverer did show remarkable chimeric
myelination after several months (Windrem et al., 2002; 2004).
These animals were transplanted with human OPCs at early neonatal
times. In order to study the efficacy of the human OPCs in adult tissue
an appropriate persistent model system will need to be developed.
One possibility to study the myelinating potential of human OPCs is
the nonhuman primate (NHP) spinal cord. We found that EB lesions
without X-irradiation in the old world African green monkey remain
persistently demyelinated for 6 months (Fig. 7A). This is in contrast to
the rat where remyelination was extensive at 3 weeks post-EB
injection.
Six months after demyelination of the NHP dorsal funiculus, only a
few, apparently quiescent phagocytic cells were observed within the
demyelinated zone (Fig. 7A), indicating that inflammationwas largely
abated by this time point. However, these long term demyelinated
(6 month) axons remained competent for remyelination since large
areas of remyelination were observed within these lesions 6 months

areas of Schwann cell-like remyelination of NHP spinal cord axons
were observed at the 1 year time point, the majority of myelinated
axons exhibited an oligodendrocyte phenotype. Thus it is likely that a
longer time period is required for recruitment of endogenous
progenitors in the NHP than in the rodent. Thus, it is likely that a
longer time period was required for recruitment of endogenous
progenitors in the NHP than in the rodent. While this time delay in the
NHP may be a species related characteristic, it is important to note
that Sim et al. (2002) found an age-dependent decrease in central
remyelination efficiency they attributed to impairment of both OPC
recruitment and differentiation. The precise age of the NHP for the
data shown in Fig. 7 is not known, but veterinary estimates from body
weight and dental structure are that the animal was a young adult.
Regardless of species or age as to the accountable factor for the
delayed remyelination, the results indicate a model system to study
the remyelination potential of cells that require a long time frame to
remyelinate.
In this NHP model system, OECs have been shown to remyelinate
demyelinated spinal cord when transplantedwithin a week after lesion
induction (Radtke et al., 2004). Fig. 7C–D shows a field of axons
remyelinated by porcine olfactory bulb-derived OECs transplanted into
the immunosuppressed NHP demyelinated thoracic spinal cord
(5 weeks post-transplantation). Note the large number of myelinated
axons with a typical peripheral pattern of myelination characteristic of
OEC remyelination. The myelinated axons are surrounded by large
cytoplastic domains with nuclei. Electron microscopic images of these
remyelinated axons indicate that they are surrounded by a basement
membrane (Radtke et al., 2004). Because the OEC remyelination was
observed at 6 weeks post-lesion induction (5 weeks post-transplanta-
tion) and endogenous repair does not occur until 6 months, this
indicates that the demyelinated axons are competent for remyelination.
The delay for endogenous repair is likely the result of impairmentofOPC
recruitment and differentiation as suggested by Sim et al. (2002). It will
be interesting to compare the remyelinating potential of OECs in the
NHP when transplanted several months after lesion induction when
inflammation is reduced to determine if efficiency of remyelination by
the transplanted cells is more robust when transplanted in an
inflammatory environment as has been reported for rodent. We stress
that themodel systems described here arewell structured experimental
models to study interactionsofOECs in thesedefinedenvironments, and
that caution should be taken to extrapolate to a clinical context.
