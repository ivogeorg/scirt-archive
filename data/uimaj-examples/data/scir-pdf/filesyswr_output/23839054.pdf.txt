AbstrAct  
The axonal compartment of developing neurons and 
mature peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons 
has the capacity to locally synthesize proteins. 
Axonally-synthesized proteins have been shown 
to facilitate axonal pathfinding and maintenance in 
developing central nervous system (CNS) and PNS 
neurons, and to facilitate the regeneration of mature 
PNS neurons. RNA-profiling studies of the axons of 
cultured neurons have shown a surprisingly complex 
population of mRNAs that encode proteins for a 
myriad of functions. Although classic-appearing rough 
endoplasmic reticulum (RER), smooth endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus have not been 
documented in axons by ultrastructural studies, 
axonal RNA profiling studies show several membrane 
and secreted protein-encoding mRNAs whose 
translation products would need access to a localized 
secretory mechanism. We previously showed that 
the axons of cultured neurons contain functional 
equivalents of RER and Golgi apparatus. Here, we 
show that markers for the signal-recognition particle, 
RER, ER, and Golgi apparatus are present in PNS 
axons in vivo. Co-localization of these proteins mirrors 
that seen for cultured axons where locally-translated 
proteins are localized to the axoplasmic membrane. 
Moreover, nerve injury increases the levels and/or 
aggregation of these proteins, suggesting that the 
regenerating axon has an increased capacity for 
membrane targeting of locally synthesized proteins.

INtrODUctION
Despite early studies of mature rodent hippocampus 
suggesting that only dendrites and not axons are capable 
of synthesizing proteins, work over the last decade has 
clearly shown that vertebrate axons, particularly growing 
and injured axons, contain ribosomes, translation factors, 
and mRNAs[1]. A wealth of earlier data existed for axonal 
protein synthesis in invertebrate neurons, but it was 
argued that incomplete polarity allowed mRNA templates 
and translational machinery to diffuse into these processes[2]. 
In the few instances where axonal mRNAs were identified in 
vertebrate neurons, no ribosomes were seen in ultrastructural 
studies, raising questions about the relevance of these axonal 
mRNAs. Elegant studies from the Singer and then Bassell, 
Hollenbeck, and Campenot groups in the mid-to-late 1990s 
showed that axonal mRNAs can be used in vertebrate 
neurons to locally generate proteins. Later studies in rodent 
sensory neurons, which can be cultured from adult animals, 
showed that this capacity for intra-axonal protein synthesis is 
maintained into adulthood. In developing neurons, most of the 
functional studies of axonal protein synthesis have pointed 
to a role in axon pathfinding. In adult neurons, axonally-
generated proteins contribute to retrograde signaling and 
regeneration after injury[3]. However, these functions in adult 
sensory neurons are likely to be expanded as we learn

more of the proteins generated in axons. For example, 
there is evidence that capsaicin induces translation in 
peripheral axons for the propagation of neuropathic pain[4, 5]. 
Moreover, recent work has shown that retrograde transport 
of herpes simplex virus from axons but not viral entry into 
axons requires axonal protein synthesis[6].
Advances in detection and profiling methodologies for 
nucleic acids have precipitated an increase in the number 
of known axonal mRNAs by many-fold. Recent publications 
on sensory neurons, hippocampal neurons and retinal 
ganglion cell axons have shown that hundreds to a few 
thousand mRNAs are localized in the axons under different 
growth conditions[7-9]. A surprising revelation from these axonal 
RNA profiles is that several of the mRNAs encode membrane 
and secreted proteins that would presumably need access 
to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus 
for co-translational secretion. However, earlier electron 
microscopy (EM) studies failed to demonstrate the classical 
ultrastructural appearance of rough endoplasmic reticulum 
(RER) and Golgi apparatus in axons[10-13]. Considering this 
paradox, we previously asked if cultured neurons contain 
any protein markers classically associated with ER, RER, 
and Golgi apparatus. Although we are still uncertain of the 
ultrastructural appearance of these axoplasmic organelles, 
we clearly showed that growing sensory and retinal 
ganglion cell axons have functional equivalents of RER and 
Golgi apparatus[14]. Several publications have pointed to the 
role of axonally-generated proteins in axon regeneration in 
the mature rodent PNS[15-18]. Here, we asked if mature rat 
PNS axons contain ER, RER, and Golgi proteins, and if 
these organelles are regulated by regeneration.

surgery
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–225 g) were used in this 
study. For nerve injury, rats (anesthetized with isoflurane) 
were subjected to a sciatic nerve crush at mid-thigh as 
previously described[19]. Seven days after injury, both 
ipsilateral and contralateral nerves were removed and a 
segment from the proximal thigh (i.e., proximal to the crush 
injury) was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and 
processed for cryoprotection in 30% sucrose[20]. All surgery 
and experiments were conducted under IACUC-approved 
protocols at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children. 
Immunofluorescence
For immunosta in ing,  nerves were processed for 
cryosectioning at 10 µm. Sections were collected on 
Superfrostplus glass slides (Fisher Scientific) and stored at 
–20°C until use. All subsequent steps were carried out at 
room temperature unless specified otherwise. Sections 
were thawed at room temperature and then treated to 
quench auto-fluorescence with 20 mmol/L glycine (BioRad) 
for 30 min (replenishing the solution every 10 min) and 
0.25 mol/L sodium borohydride (Sigma) for another 30 min. 
Sections were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS), permeabilized with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 for 
15 min, generously rinsed in fresh PBS, blocked with 10% 
serum to avoid non-specific binding, and then processed for 
immunofluorescent labeling as previously described[14]. The 
following antibodies were used: mouse anti-SRP54 (1:200; 
BD-Transduction Lab.), goat anti-ribophorin II (1:100; Santa 
Cruz Biotech.), rabbit anti-TRAPα (1:300; Christopher 
Nicchitta, Duke Univ., Durham, NC), mouse anti-calreticulin 
(1:200; BD-Transduction Lab.), rabbit anti-ERp29 (1:200; 
Affinity Bioreagents); mouse anti-PDI (1:200; Stressgen); 
mouse anti-KDEL-receptor (1:800; Stressgen), mouse anti-
GM130 (1:200; Abcam or 1:50; BD Transduction), mouse 
anti-TGN38 (1:200; Affinity Bioreagents), rabbit anti-SERCA 
(1:100: Jonathan Lytton, University of Calgary, Canada), 
chicken anti-neurofilament (1:800; Chemicon), and rabbit 
anti-peripherin (1:500; Chemicon). Secondary antibodies 
consisted of FITC-, Alexa 555- or Cy5-conjugated donkey 
anti-mouse, anti-chick, or anti-rabbit IgGs (1:400; Jackson 
Immunoresearch). Samples were mounted with Vectashield 
(Vector Labs) and imaged using confocal microscopy with 
a Leica TCS/SP2 or Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. 
Image processing was performed using the Leica confocal 
or Volocity software packages as indicated below. ImageJ 
was used to quantitate protein signal intensity using images 
matched for exposure, gain, offset and post-processing. 
Student’s t-test was used to calculate the significance for 
signal intensities shown in Fig. 3.

PNs Axons contain Er, rEr, and Golgi Apparatus 
Proteins In Vivo
Most proteins that need to be targeted for membrane 
localization or secretion are co-translationally targeted 
Tanuja Merianda, et al.    PNS axons contain machinery for co-translational secretion of axonally-generated proteins 495
through the action of the signal-recognition particle (SRP) 
that halts ribosome progression on the encoding mRNA. 
The SRP recognizes the nascent polypeptide for targeting 
through an N-terminal signal peptide sequence and the 
SRP-mRNA-ribosome complex is moved to the ER in areas 
that constitute the RER[21]. Newly-synthesized proteins 
then have access to the ER lumen for transit to the Golgi 
and cell surface. We had previously demonstrated that the 
axons of cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and retinal 
ganglion cell neurons contain protein constituents of these 
organelles ranging from the SRP to RER to ER to cis- 
and trans-Golgi apparatus[14]. Each of the antibodies used 
in that study was validated by immunoblot showing high 
specificity for the anticipated molecular-weight proteins. 
Here, we have used immunofluorescence with these 
validated antibodies to components of the co-translational 
secretory apparatus proteins to ask if axons contain RER, 
ER and Golgi apparatus in vivo. By taking high-resolution 
optical sections, with confocal microscopy of longitudinal 
nerve sections, we were able to optically isolate the 
axoplasm from surrounding Schwann cells and other non-
neuronal cells (Figs. 1 and 2).

We initially asked if the components needed for 
ribosome docking with the ER are present in axons of 
the mature, uninjured sciatic nerve. SRP54, a protein 
constituent of the SRP[22], co-localized with ribophorin II, 
an ER membrane protein involved in the glycosylation 
of nascent proteins[23], in the sciatic nerve sections and 
these signals focally overlapped with the peripherin signal 
used to mark axons (Fig. 1A). Newly-synthesized proteins 
enter the ER lumen by interaction with the translocon-
associated protein (TRAPα)[24]. TRAPα and ribophorin II 
showed focal co-localization overlapping with peripherin 
(Fig. 1B). The ribophorin II immunoreactivity overlapped 
with calreticulin protein, an ER chaperone protein that 
plays a role in protein folding[25] (Fig. 1C). The lumenal 
ER chaperone protein ERp29 also showed focal overlap 
with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which plays a role 
in the formation of disulfide bridges in the ER[26] (Fig. 1D). 
Finally, we asked if the axons contain the KDEL receptor, 
a lumenal ER protein that shuttles resident ER proteins 
from cis-Golgi back to the ER[27]. Focal immunoreactivity 
for the KDEL receptor overlapped with peripherin signals 
and these co-localized with ERp29 immunoreactivity in the 
axons (Fig. 1E). Markers for cis- and trans-Golgi proteins 
similarly showed axonal localization, but did not co-localize 
with any of the ER proteins except for KDEL receptor that 
shuttles between the ER and cis-Golgi (data not shown).

A summary of these SRP-RER-ER-Golgi marker 
co-localization studies from sciatic nerve axons is 
schematically illustrated in Fig. 1F. These data showed 
the trend of protein co-localization that we visualized in 
the axons of cultured DRG neurons[14], and strongly argue 
that PNS axons have the capacity to appropriately target 
locally-synthesized membrane and secreted proteins in 
vivo. Although the localization studies shown in Fig. 1 are 
based on single optical planes, there remained a possibility 
that these signals were derived from closely-apposed 
non-neuronal cells in these nerves. Thus, we examined 
orthogonal sections from Z stacks to determine if these 
RER, ER, and Golgi apparatus proteins co-localized in the 
XZ and YZ planes and found clear co-localization of these 
proteins with neurofilament in both planes (Fig. 2).   
Protein-trafficking Machinery in the Axons of Rat 
sciatic Nerve Is Altered by Injury
The above data suggested that PNS axons contain the 
necessary components for co-translational secretion of 
axonally-synthesized proteins. Several lines of evidence 
indicate that PNS axons synthesize proteins in vivo[17, 18, 28]. 
Using a viral transduction system coupled with an axonally-
targeted fusion protein, we recently showed that the mRNA 
for neuronal membrane protein 35 (NMP35) is localized to 
PNS axons in vivo and its protein product appears to be 
inserted into axoplasmic membrane in vivo[20]. In our hands, 
locally-generated NMP35 increases axon growth from 
cultured DRG neurons. Thus, we asked if nerve injury with 
the subsequent spontaneous axonal regeneration in the 
PNS might trigger changes in the RER, ER or Golgi protein 
profiles in axons.
Nerve-crush injury was used to activate regeneration 
programs in peripheral nerve. We examined the nerves 
at 7 days post-crush, a time when axons have recovered 
from the initial injury and started regenerating. In exposure-
matched optical planes of naïve, uninjured (contralateral), 
and injured/regenerating sciatic nerve, there were clear 
changes in the relative intensity of immunoreactivity for 
several of the SRP, RER, ER, and Golgi apparatus proteins 
tested (Fig. 3). SRP54, ribophorin II, PDI, KDEL receptor, 
and the trans-Golgi network protein 38 (TGN38) showed 
increased immunoreactivity in the injured/regenerating 
compared to the uninjured sciatic nerve axons (Fig. 3A–D, 
G–J, M–N). This change in immunoreactivity was not as 
apparent for the other proteins tested. However, the axonal 
signals for the 130-kDa cis-Golgi marker protein (GM130) 
showed increased aggregation in the injured/regenerating 
compared to the uninjured sciatic nerve axons (Fig. 3K, L). 
Quantitation of the intra-axonal signals for these proteins 
confirmed a significant increase in SRP54, ribophorin II, 
PDI, KDEL receptor, and TGN38 immunoreactivity in the 
injured compared to naïve nerve sections (Fig. 3O, P, R, 
S, and U). There were no significant differences between 
injured and naïve for intra-axonal TRAPα and GM130 
immunoreactivity (Fig. 3Q and T). Taken together, these 
data suggest that injury triggers a shift in the ability of 
PNS axons to co-translationally direct new proteins for 
membrane targeting and secretion.
DIscUssION
Although previous EM studies have not detected the 
classical ultrastructure of the ER and Golgi apparatus in 
distal axons, previous work has clearly shown that the 
axons of cultured neurons have functional equivalents of 
RER, ER, and Golgi[14]. Here, we showed that PNS axons 
contain co-localizing SRP, RER, ER, and Golgi apparatus 
protein immunoreactivity in vivo that is comparable to what 
we previously saw in the axons of cultured neurons[14]. 
This strongly suggests that axonally-synthesized proteins 
can gain access to a classical co-translational secretory 
mechanism in the intact animal. In addition to ruling out 
the potential confounds that culture conditions present for 
localization studies like these, the data further emphasize 
that these structures can be localized centimeters away 
from the cell body. Indeed, we estimate that the mid-thigh 
region analyzed here was 5–6 cm from the L4–5 DRGs and 
anterior horns where the cell bodies of these sciatic nerve 
axons reside. 
The localization studies performed here do not address 
the functions of the intra-axonal RER, ER and Golgi 
complex, but there are reports that link locally-translated 
proteins to transmembrane signaling events. Work from 
the Flanagan lab showed that locally-synthesized EphA2 
protein alters the trajectory of commissural axons in the 
developing spinal cord[29]. The classic function of this 
receptor in axonal pathfinding would require its membrane 
localization. There is increasing evidence for localized 
translation in adult neurons in vivo. The Fainzilber lab 
Tanuja Merianda, et al.    PNS axons contain machinery for co-translational secretion of axonally-generated proteins 499
recently showed that the translation of axonally-targeted 
importin β1 mRNA is needed for PNS injury-induced gene 
regulation in the DRG in vivo[17]. Donnelly et al. showed that 
localized translation of axonal β-actin and GAP-43 mRNAs 
is needed for axonal outgrowth after nerve injury[15]. The 
Jaffrey lab used a Sindbis viral transduction approach to 
show that adult spinal axons can synthesize proteins[30]. 
Though none of these studies in adult systems addressed 
membrane or secreted proteins, there is circumstantial 
evidence for the function of these co-translational secretory 
mechanisms in PNS axons in vivo. Toth et al. (2009) 
showed that CGRP mRNA is enriched in axons after injury, 
and localized translation of CGRP triggers the migration of 
Schwann cells via a mechanism requiring the expression 
of CGRP-receptor components in these glial cells[31]. This 
effect would require that the locally-synthesized CGRP 
protein has access to a secretory mechanism. Moreover, 
the protein product of an axonally-targeted NMP35-AcGFP 
fusion protein mRNA is clearly inserted into the axoplasmic 
membrane of sciatic nerve axons, based on confocal 
imaging of nerve sections and teased nerve preparations[20]. 
This would again require access to a secretory mechanism, 
suggesting that the RER, ER, and Golgi apparatus protein 
constituents that we showed here to be localized in PNS 
axons in vivo are undoubtedly functional. In addition, 
mRNAs encoding ER chaperone proteins localize to PNS 
axons in vitro and in vivo[32], and translational upregulation 
of these could provide a means for increasing the axon’s 
capacity for co-translational secretion of locally-generated 
proteins after injury[33]. 
As noted above, a few studies indicate that spinal cord 
axons can translate proteins, both in development[29, 34] and 
in the adult[30, 35]. Importantly for the theme of this edition 
of Neuroscience Bulletin, Willis et al. (2011) reported that 
sensory axons in adult mouse spinal cord show injury-
induced translation of a GFP reporter transgene targeted to 
axons through the 3’UTR of β-actin[36]. There is a clear need 
to determine if membrane localization and secretion occurs 
in axons after spinal cord injury, both for the ascending 
axons studied by Willis et al. (2011)[36] and descending 
axons that show overall poorer regeneration after injury.
