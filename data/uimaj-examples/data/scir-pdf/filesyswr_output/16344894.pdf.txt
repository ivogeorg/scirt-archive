Abstract: The acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a commonly seen and severe case in clinic. However, the repair and
regeneration of injured spinal cord is limited. This is likely due to that different kinds of factors are involved in regeneration after SCI.
In the present study, we used complementary DNA microarray consisting of 4 041 specific probes from rat to identify genes that were
differentially expressed after SCI. The animals were subjected to complete transection injury of the thoracic spinal cord (T8-T9). Sham
operated animals received only a laminectomy. Four and a half days later, rat spinal cord was dissected out for total RNA isolation. The
fluorescent (Cy3 and Cy5) labeled probes were prepared and hybridized to the microarray. Genes that showed 2-fold difference in SCI
tissue were identified. Sixty-five up-regulated genes consisted of 21 known genes, 30 known expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and 14
unknown genes. Seventy-nine down-regulated genes comprised 20 known genes, 42 known ESTs and 17 unknown genes. In 41
differentially expressed known genes, 5 up-regulated genes, i.e., tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (Timp1), transgelin (Tagln),
vimentin (Vim), Fc gamma receptor, cathepsin S (Ctss), and 3 down-regulated genes, i.e.,  stearyl-CoA desaturase, coagulation factor II
(F2), endosulfin alpha (Ensa), were further confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These genes may
play a role in the response to tissue damage or repair following SCI and characterization of them might be helpful to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of spinal cord injury and regeneration.

摘 要：脊髓损伤是一类常见的、高致残率的中枢神经系统疾病，由于多种复杂因素影响其损伤后的修复过程，损伤脊髓
的再生能力非常有限。本研究采用 cDNA微阵列技术筛选大鼠脊髓损伤后出现的差异表达基因。实验组动物在 T8-T9进行脊
髓全横断手术，对照组动物只打开椎板；4.5 d后取脊髓进行RNA提取并在反转录过程中进行Cy3/Cy5标记，然后与预制的、
带有 4 041条特异性探针的芯片进行杂交。Cy5/Cy3信号比值≥ 2.0视为脊髓损伤后出现差异表达的基因。通过筛选，我们
得到了 65个上调表达基因(21个已知基因，30个已知 EST和 14个未知基因)和 79个下调基因(20个已知基因，42个已知 EST
和 17个未知基因)。进一步通过半定量RT-PCR对其中的 5个上调已知基因(Timp1, Tagln, Vim, Fc gamma receptor, Ctss)和三个下
调已知基因(stearyl-CoA desaturase, F2, Ensa)的表达情况进行了验证，结果显示与芯片结果一致。这些基因可能在脊髓损伤后
的修复过程中起一定的作用，对其深入研究将有助于揭示脊髓损伤修复的分子机制。

Acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is an unexpected,
devastating event, the consequences of which often per-
sist for the life of the patients and influence in diverse ways
not only the patients, but also family members and society
Acta Physiologica Sinica, December 25, 2005, 57 (6): 705-713706
at large. In most countries, acute SCI occurs at an annual
rate of 20~40 persons per million[1]. Although prevention
programs have been initiated, there is no evidence that the
incidence is declining. The initial costs of hospitalization
are high, and subsequent medical care is expensive. Thus,
the development of effective treatments for SCI will have
great benefits. The trauma to the spinal cord can result in
the destruction of neurons, nerve fibers passing through
the spinal cord, supporting glial cells and blood vessels, at
the site of injury. At the site of mechanical insult, approxi-
mately 30% of the neurofilament proteins were degraded
within 1 h, and 70% of them were lost within 4 h after
injury. At the same time, the trauma to the spinal cord
gives rise to changes of many genes’ expression level. These
altered genes may lead to damage to the injured spinal cord
or lack of regeneration in the injured spinal cord and per-
manent functional impairment. SCI induced by trauma is a
consequence of an initial physical insult and a subsequent
progressive injury process that involves various
pathochemical events leading to tissue destruction. The
response to SCI is known to occur in two phases. The
first phase, the primary injury, is the mechanical trauma
initially sustained. The second phase, termed secondary
injury, is posttraumatic tissue damage. The neurological
deficits caused by secondary injury occur within minutes
of the injury and continue for days, weeks or longer[2].
The second phase is an autodestructive process that in-
cludes physiological, biological and metabolic changes.
These changes result in axonal damage and cell loss. So,
the second phase should be a target of pharmacological
treatment. But despite intensive treatment efforts, the prog-
nosis in acute SCI remains a pessimistic one. The injured
spinal cord fails to regenerate due to two reasons, lack of
regeneration promoters and production of regeneration
inhibitors. The injured mammalian neurons can success-
fully regenerate in the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
This regenerative capacity has been attributed to produc-
tion of a variety of secreted polypeptides known as neu-
rotrophic factors during the regeneration process[3]. In
2000, scientists found that Nogo protein may inhibit axon
regeneration[4]. In addition, it has become increasingly rec-
ognized that the nervous system also initiates reactive pro-
cess in response to trauma that are neuroprotective and
regenerative[5]. All these responses to SCI are, in part, due
to changes at the gene expression level.
To further understand the molecular regulation of com-
plex process of injury and regeneration after SCI, many
genes have been isolated and extensively studied with con-
ventional methods. Previous studies identified several SCI-
related gene expression and protein changes using in situ
hybridization, RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohis-
tochemistry[6-11]. However, these techniques are slow and
laborious thereby enabling only a few genes to be investi-
gated at a time. In order to identify more genes at the same
time, many new technologies have been developed in re-
cent years. GeneChip® is one of the newest technologies.
It provides insights into changes of global gene expression
at a time. GeneChip® or microarrays are constructed ei-
ther with thousands of immobilized cDNAs or with photo-
chemically synthesized oligonucleotides within 1 cm2 on a
glass or a plastic slide[12]. The development of GeneChip®
and related techniques has enabled researchers to profile
the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously,
providing an effective tool for large-scale gene expression
studies. Song et al. analyzed changes in the mRNA
abundance at 3 and 24 h after SCI in adult rats using
GeneChip®[13]. Fan et al. identified and compared the genes
that were differentially expressed in the periphery nervous
systems and central nervous systems following injury by
microarray techniques[14]. So microarray analysis is a pow-
erful tool to quickly examine expression of thousands of
genes at a time.
In the present study, we tried to analyze the changes in
mRNA abundance at 4.5 d after traumatic injury to rat
spinal cord by microarray techniques. Our results demon-
strate that SCI causes a significant change in the expres-
sion of genes, the products of which are involved in signal
transduction, inflammation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism,
acute phase reaction, remodeling injured tissue. Changes
observed by microarray analysis for representative genes
were also confirmed by RT-PCR.
1  MATERIALS  AND METHODS
1.1  Animals
Six adult littermate male Wistar rats, bought from the Ex-
periment Animal Center of Academy of Military Medical
Sciences, were used in this investigation. The animals,
weighing 200~300 g, were divided randomly into two
groups, injured and control. All rats were anesthetized with
intraperitoneal injections of sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/
kg). The skin was surgically scrubbed with ethanol and
the hair at the surgical field was removed. The rats in in-
jured group were subjected to a complete transection in-
jury of the thoracic spinal cord (T8-T9). The control group
received only a laminectomy. The animals, survived for
another 4.5 d, were killed by decapitation. The whole spi-
nal cord of each rat was dissected out for total RNA

extraction.
1.2  Total RNA extraction
We used RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) to extract
total RNA. The spinal cords were homogenized using a
conventional rotor-stator homogenizer. Then total RNA was
extracted according to the protocol described by the
manufacturer. The purity of the isolated total RNA was
analyzed by absorption at 260 nm and 280 nm with ultra-
violet spectrophotometry Unicam 330. The integrity of the
total RNA was assessed with TAE agarose gel electro-
phoresis.
1.3  Preparation of probes
Total RNA (30 µg) of each group was converted to cDNA
probes by reverse transcription with oligodT as primer.
The cDNA probes were labeled with Cy3-dCTP for con-
trol group and Cy5-dCTP for injured group, respectively.
Two kinds of cDNA probes were mixed up and dissolved
in the hybridization solution.
1.4  Hybridization and washing
The cDNA microarray including 4 041 spots was obtained
from the BioStar Genechip, Inc., Shanghai. The 4 041 rat
specific probes on the cDNA microarray were obtained by
subtraction hybridization between rat tissues. The probes
were denatured at 95ºC for 2 min and chilled on the ice
quickly. The cDNA microarray (prehybridization
processed) were denatured in 95ºC water for 30 s and
then put into water-free ethanol. The denatured probes were
added to region of chip and then sealed with a cover glass.
Hybridization reaction lasted for 18 h at 42ºC. Then the
cDNA microarray were washed with 0.5% washing solu-
tion 1, following with the solution containing 0.5% wash-
ing solution 1 and 2% washing solution 2 for 10 min at
60ºC and then with 5% washing solution 3 for 10 min at
60ºC. The chip was washed with 0.5% washing solution 1
again and then dried at room temperature. All hybridization
solutions and washing solutions were provided by BioStar
Genechip.
1.5  Data analysis
The cDNA micrparray used contained several probes spe-
cific for rat housekeepers (β-actin, γ-actin, GAPDH, 5 S
rRNA, and so on), which served as positive controls. Sev-
eral rice probes on the chip severed as negative controls
and several probes severed as blank controls for back-
ground subtraction. The specific probes on the chip are
products of PCR from subtraction hybridization of rat
tissues, that is, these probes are specific for each tissue.
The cDNA microarray was scanned with ScanArray4000
and the images were processed by GenePix 3.0 software.
At first, the values of Cy3 or Cy5 were obtained after back-
ground subtraction. The values of Cy5 under 200 were
replaced with 200. The number of effective genes was
counted. The effective genes, valued according to both
values of Cy3 and Cy5, are beyond 200 or either beyond
800 and Ri (Cy5/Cy3) is between 0.1 and 10. The average
of the natural logarithm of Ri was computed, i.e. R’. The
normalization index (ND) equals EXP(R’). Second, the
adjusted value of Cy3, which multiply ND by Cy3, is Cy3*.
The values of Cy3* under 200 were replaced with 200. At
last, the value of Cy5/Cy3* of all genes were computed.
The genes that ratio (Cy5/Cy3*) is beyond 2 or under 0.5
are differentially expressed in injured group and control
group.
1.6  Confirmation of differential expression by semi-
quantitative RT-PCR
The semi-quantitative PCR protocols were employed to
further confirm the cDNA microarray results. We chose
five up-regulated known genes and three down-regulated
known genes, they were, cathepsin S (Ctss), Fc gamma
receptor, vimentin (Vim), Transgelin (Tagln), tissue inhibi-
tor of metalloproteinase 1 (Timp1) and stearyl-CoA
desaturase, coagulation factor II (F2), endosulfine alpha
(Ensa) respectively. At the same time, glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified as an
internal control. Total RNA (2 µg) from each group sample
was reversely transcribed with oligo(dT)15  primers using
Superscipt II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL). RT-PCR
was performed in the Gene Amp PCR System 9700 (Applied
Biosystems, USA). Briefly, 2 µl cDNA and gene specific
primers (Table 1) were added to TaKaRa PCR Mix (TaKaRa
Taq DNA polymerase, dNTPs, optimal buffer components;
TaKaRa) and subjected to PCR amplification. PCR prod-
ucts were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose
gels. Images of ethidium-bromide-stained bands were
scaned with ImageMaster VDS (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech).
2  RESULTS
2.1  Results of extraction of total RNA
The total RNA isolated from spinal cords was evaluated
with ultraviolet analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis.
The values of OD260/OD280 of the total RNA from injury
group and control group were 1.905 and 2.087 with ultra-
violet analysis, respectively. The electrophoresis result
showed that the ratio of 18 S/28 S was approximately 1/2
and the bands from low to high molecular weight appeared
smear (Fig. 1). The data indicated that the total RNA iso-

lated bears higher purity and integrity.
2.2  Differentially expressed genes between the in-
jured and the control groups
The hybridized cDNA microarray were scaned with
ScanArray4000. The obtained images were analyzed with
GenePix Pro 3.0. 3 913 spots were effective genes. Our
experiment revealed that the expression of 144 genes
changed significantly at 4.5 d after SCI as compared with
control spinal cord tissue, including up-regulation of 65
genes and down-regulation of 79 genes. The 144 differen-
tially expressed genes included 41 known genes (Table 2),
72 known ESTs and 31 unknown genes. A scatter diagram
(Fig. 2) was made and the spots near the 45º straight line
represented the genes without change in expression level,
while those genes far away from the 45º straight line rep-
resented the genes with differential expression.

hybridization signal of Cy3 and Y axis reflecting that of Cy5. Each
spot stands for hybridized signal of a gene. The red spots indicate
that value Y/value X are between 0.5 and 2.0 and belong to
undifferentially expressed genes. The yellow spots indicate that the
ratio of value Y to value X is beyond 2.0 or under 0.5 and likely to be
differentially expressed genes.

3  DISCUSSION
We used RNeasy Mini Kit to isolate total RNA from the rat
spinal cord tissue. The isolated total RNA from injured and
control groups were of higher quality in purity and integrity,
which assured the success of cDNA microarray. In this
cDNA microarray, normalization index (ND=1.0907) is
between 0.4 and 2.5 and the average ratios of signal den-
sity from injured group or control group to background
are not less than 3. These data indicate that our experiment
is in conformance with the successful standard of cDNA
microarray. The RT-PCR results of eight selected genes
further confirmed that cDNA microarray results are
credible.
Using GeneChip® protoclos, Song et al. had reported
the changes of mRNA abundance at 3 and 24 h after SCI
in adult rats. Nesic et al. had reported that SCI, 1 h after
trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and
ESTs[15].  Zhang et al. investigated gene expression pro-
files at 14 d after a complete spinal transection at the 11th
thoracic level in adult rats using cDNA microarray. Among
7 523 genes and ESTs examined, 444 transcripts, includ-
ing 218 genes and 226 ESTs, were identified to be either
up-regulated (373 of 444) or down-regulated (71 of 444)
greater than 2.0-fold in the spinal cord, which were cat-
egorized into seven classes which included cell division-
related protein, channels and receptors, cytoskeletal
elements, extracellular matrix proteins, metalloproteinases
and inhibitors, growth-associated molecules, metabolism,
intracellular transducers and transcription factors, as well
as others[16]. By interrogating Affymetrix U34A rat genome
GeneChip microarrays, Velardo et al. defined the transcrip-
tional expression patterns in midcervical contusion lesion
sites between 1 and 90 d postinjury of athymic nude (AN)
and Sprague- Dawley (SD) strains. Stringent statistical
analyses detected significant changes in 3 638 probe sets,
with 80 genes differing between the AN and SD
groups[17]. Tachibana et al. analyzed changes in the mRNA
abundance at 24 h after SCI in adult rats using cDNA
microarray. However, their data were related to within one
day after SCI. The injured spinal cord evaluated during 8
weeks by the inclined plane test showed that the motor
disturbances peaked within 24 h after injury and were not
completely recovered after 56 d. However, there was a
striking enhancement phase at motor function recovery,
that was, from the first day to the seventh day after SCI [18].
So, it is likely to find some genes related to regeneration
after SCI at this phase.
It was accepted that the injury reactions mainly occurred
in the first 2 d after SCI. And beginning from 3 d after
injury, the regeneration became actively, predominant, and
arrived the top at 4~5 d. So in the present study we chose
4.5 d postinjury to screen differentially expressed genes
that highly related to the repair and regeneration process of
the injured spinal cord. There are different animal models
used to investigate SCI. Many scientists use physically
transected spinal cord for studying spinal cord regenera-
tion and the high reproduction and easy standardization are
features of this model.
Concerted expression of thousands of genes in a con-
trolled manner is essential for spinal cord function. Trau-
matic injury to the spinal cord causes the altered expres-
sion of many genes. The results of the present study found
altered mRNA abundance (>2.0) of 144 genes at 4.5 d
711XIAO Lin et al: cDNA Microarray Analysis of Spinal Cord Injury and Regeneration Related Genes in Rat
after SCI, compared with sham control. The 144 changed
genes include 79 up-regulated genes and 65 down-regu-
lated genes. The up-regulated genes consist of 20 known
genes, 42 known ESTs and 17 unknown genes. The down-
regulated genes comprise 21 known genes, 30 known ESTs
and 14 unknown genes. Some of 41 known genes (Vim,
Timp 1, Coagulation factor II, Clusterin) were previously
reported. However, many changes observed presently are
first-time reports. The changed genes are involved in two
types of molecules. One is promoter and the other is in-
hibitor for regeneration after SCI. The regeneration after
SCI is mediated by the two types of molecules together.
The spinal regeneration is highly dependent on intracel-
lular calcium concentration[19]. Alpha-endosulphine, a pro-
tein that belongs to the cAMP-regulated-phosphoprotein
family, has been detected in a wide variety of tissues, con-
centrated particularly in the central nervous system. Under
physiological conditions, alpha-endosulphine mainly acts
to block voltage-gated Ca2+-channels[20]. The level of
phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PiK4cb) is up-regulated and
that of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (Inpp4b) is
down-regulated at 4.5 d after SCI PiK4cb catalyze the first
step in the synthesis of an important information transmit-
tance regulator — phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate[21].
Inpp4b catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 4-position phos-
phate of inositol 3,4-bisphosphate [Ins(3,4)P2], inositol
1,3,4-trisphosphate [Ins(1,3,4)P3], and to a greater de-
gree phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P2][22].
The first two substrates are intermediates in the break-
down of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] to
inositol, the former being important for Ca2+ release via
calcium channel. The common function of PiK4cb and
Inpp4b is to promote Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm.
Meanwhile, the phospholipid substrate of Inpp4b,
PtdIns(3,4)P2, has been shown to increase following stimu-
lation of cells by growth factors that activate phospholipid
3-kinase (PI3-K)[23]. [Ins(3,4)P2] has been shown to di-
rectly bind and activate the Akt protooncogene, which is
involved in cell proliferation.
Alpha-chimaerin (Table 2) occurs as alpha 1- and alter-
natively spliced Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing
alpha2-isoforms. Alpha2-chimaerin mRNA was highly ex-
pressed in the rat embryonic nervous system, especially in
early postmitotic neurons. Alpha2-chimaerin protein local-
ized to neuronal perikaryons, dendrites, and axons. The
overall pattern of alpha2-chimaerin mRNA expression re-
sembles that of cyclin-dependent kinase regulator p35,
which participates in neuronal differentiation and with which
chimaerin interacts. The transfection experiments of N1E-
115 neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that alpha2-
chimaerin transfectants generated neurites and alpha1-
chimaerin transfectants displayed numerous microspikes
and containing F-actin clusters, but generated few
neurites[24].
Vimentin (Table 2) is one of the members of intermedi-
ate filaments. It exists in mesenchyme cells, chondrocyte
and endothelial cells, particularly in fibroblast and differen-
tiating cells. Many experiments showed that there was a
large increase in vimentin (+) cells at the lesion site[25,26].
Dervan and Roberts observed that the newly formed canal
was greatly enlarged and was dominated by ependymocytes
that are vimentin immunopositive after the spinal cord
transection of eel Anguilla whose injured spinal cord can
quickly regrow, reconnect and recover function. Vimentin
may play an important role in regeneration of spinal cord[27].
Cysteine lysosomal proteases are essential for turnover
of intracellular and extracellular proteins. These enzymes
are strongly implicated in normal and pathological processes
involving tissue remodeling[28]. Cathepsin B, cathepsin S
and cathepsin Y are the members of cysteine lysosomal
proteases which belong to papain superfamily. Cathepsin
B can degrade myelin basic protein[29] and cathepsin Y can
produce bradykinin potentiating peptide[30]. Cathepsin S can
degrade a number of extracellular matrix molecules at neu-
tral pH since it remains most of its enzymatic activity at
neutral pH. Inflammatory mediators can stimulate secre-
tion of cathepsin S from the microglia and macro-phages.
The survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein is expressed
in all tissues of mammalian organisms, but particularly high
levels are expressed in motor neurons. SMN and SMN
interacting protein 1 (SIP1) are found both in the nucleus
and cytoplasm of somatic cells. The interaction of SMN
and SIP1 plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of
spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs)
which function in pre-mRNA splicing[31]. The impaired pro-
duction of snRNPs may contribute to motoneuron
degeneration.
Clusterin is a glycoprotein that has been implicated in a
number of cellular processes, such as lipid transfer, cell-
cell interaction, apoptosis and inhibition of the terminal
complement complex formation. Analysis of the promoter
region of the TRPM-2 gene demonstrated that the putative
control region contains several potential regulatory elements
that may regulate the complex tissue-specific control of a
gene which must be constitutively expressed in some tis-
sues but repressed in others until induced during active
cell death[32].
Gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (Bbox), lipoprotein
Acta Physiologica Sinica, December 25, 2005, 57 (6): 705-713712
lipase (LPL), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A syn-
thase 1 (Hmgcs1), bile acid-coenzyme A dehydrogenase:
amino acid n-acyltransferase (Baat) and stearyl-CoA
desaturase play important roles in the lipid metabolism. Bbox
catalyzes conversion of gamma-butyrobetaine to carnitine.
The carnitine system plays a key role in beta-oxidation of
long-chain fatty acids by permitting their transport into the
mitochondrial matrix. LPL is a key enzyme involved in the
metabolism of lipoproteins. Spinal cord of the rat contains
more lipoprotein lipase than other brain regions. LPL-me-
diated hydrolysis of exogenous triacylglycerol is an impor-
tant source of free fatty acids for the Schwann cell[33].
Hmgcs1 is responsible for 3-hydrox-3-methylglutaryl CoA
biosynthesis in the cell. The 3-hydrox-3-methylglutaryl CoA
is an important mediator in synthesis of cholesterol and
ketone bodies. Baat catalyzes the conjugation of bile acids
with glycine or taurine. The level of Baat deceased at 6 and
12 h in the regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy[34].
The Baat may play a role in acute-phase reactions. The
clinic evidence showed that the ratio of Baat quantity in
tumorous tissue to nontumorous is positive relative to prog-
nosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients after partial
hepatectomy. Stearyl-CoA desaturase is expressed by oli-
godendrocytes as well as Schwann cells. It is involved in
the synthesis and regulation of long-chain unsaturated fatty
acids essential for myelination[35].
In addition to the above discussed genes, there are some
genes, such as RT1.D(n), RT1.Ma and RT1.Au genes en-
coding MHC class I and MHC class II molecules are also
differentially expressed 4.5 d after SCI. The function of
these genes in the regeneration after SCI is not clear and
they maybe play roles in the cell-cell recognition and
communication. So, we should strive to explore the func-
tion of these altered expression genes and identify some
targets for clinic treatment. At the same time, we should
realize that molecular mechanism of regeneration after SCI
is very complex. There will be a farther way to go in this
region.
