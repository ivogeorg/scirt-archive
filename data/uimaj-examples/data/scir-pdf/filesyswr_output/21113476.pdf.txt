In experiments on rats with lateral TVIII hemisection of the spinal cord and transplantation of 
ensheating olfactory cells, we studied structural changes at the lesion site and adjacent rostral 
and dorsal regions of the spinal cord. The state of oligodendrocytes and myelin fi bers and 
motor function in experimental animal were analyzed. Open fi eld testing (BBB test) showed 
that motor functions steadily increased (by 13% on average) within the interval from day 21 
to day 53 after transplantation. Histological examination showed that groups of transplanted 
cells carrying human nuclear marker (HNu+ cells) were still present at the lesion site 30 days 
after surgery. Some of these cells migrated in the rostral and caudal directions from the in-
jection site to a distance up to 6 mm. At the initial period after hemisection, the number of 
oligodendrocytes (O4+-cells) in the immediate vicinity to the lesion site decreased 2-fold, but 
no signifi cant changes in the number of neurons were found in the rostral and dorsal frag-
ments of the spinal cord compared to the corresponding parameter in controls. Sixty days 
after transplantation, the cross-section area in the rostral part of the spinal cord at a distance 
of 3 mm from damage site increased by 15.3% compared to the control. The number of O4+-
cells at the lesion site and in adjacent rostral and caudal parts of the spinal cord by 22.8% 
surpassed that in the control group. The number of remyelinated axons also increased. These 
fi ndings suggest the absence of pronounced structural changes in the rostral and caudal parts 
of the spinal cord compared to lesion site at early stages after damage and cell transplanta-
tion. At the same time, pronounced activation of oligodendrocytes in this region suggests their 
involvement together with Schwann cells into remyelination of regenerating axons, which can 
serve as a factor of partial restoration of motor functions after spinal cord injury.

Traumatic injuries of the spinal cord are associated 
with local loss of neurons and demyelination of axons 
of ascending and descending spinal tracts. Numerous 
experimental and clinical studies showed that regen-
eration of the spinal cord (spontaneous and inducted 
by pharmacological agents and cell therapy) is associ-
ated with regeneration of damaged neurons and new 
formation of myelin sheath around the preserved and 
regenerated fi bers of the spinal tracts, which results in 
partial compensation of impaired motor and sensory 
functions [7-9]. In these studies, the most contradic-
tory issue is conception concerning the recovery of 
myelin sheaths observed mainly after transplantation 
of glial cells from the olfactory system (olfactory en-
sheating cells). Previously obtained data on the role 
of these cells in remyelination after spinal lesion [11] 
were not confi rmed in later studies, where the main

role was assigned to Schwann cells [10,13]. At the 
same time, the data about the state of oligodendro-
glia and its involvement into remyelination of spinal 
cord tract fi bers outside the damaged area during cell 
therapy are extremely limited.
Here we studied the state of oligodendrocytes in 
damaged spinal cord and their role in regeneration 
of myelin sheaths after transplantation of olfactory 
epithelium cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiments were carried out on 14 mongrel rats 
weighted 200-250 g. The animals were kept under 
standard conditions with free access to food and water. 
After laminectomy under urethane anesthesia (600 mg/
kg intraperitoneally), local hemisection of the spinal 
cord at the right side at TVIII level was performed. This 
method of hemisection allowed using the undamaged 
side of the spinal cord for evaluation of the character 
and extent of posttraumatic processes at the damaged 
area. Olfactory epithelium (OE) cells were used for 
transplantation; the cells were obtained from Depart-
ment of Applied and Fundamental Neurology (V. P. 
Serbskii Research Center of Social and Forensic Psy-
chiatry) and cultured as described previously [1]. After 
hemisection, 200,000 cells in 5 μl Ringer solution 
were injected to experimental group animals (n=8) 
in two points 1 mm rostrally and caudally from the 
hemisection plane and 0.5 mm laterally from the mid-
line towards the damaged side. Control animals (n=6) 
received 5 μl Ringer solution at the same points. Lo-
comotor function in control and experimental animals 
was regularly evaluated starting from day 2 to day 53 
in the open fi eld test (BBB test) [2].
The data were processed statistically using 
ANOVA and Mann–Whitney test.
Histological and immunocytochemical examina-
tion of the spinal cords from the experimental and 
control animals were carried 30 and 60 days after the 
intervention. Anaesthetized animals were transcardi-
ally perfused with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and then 
with 4% paraformaldehyde on phosphate buffer. After 
laminectomy, a 20-mm fragment of the spinal cord

with hemisection plane in the center was isolated. The 
material was additionally fi xed in neutral formalin or 
glutaraldehyde and embedded in paraffi n and a mix-
ture of epon and araldite resin according to standard 
techniques. On cross-sections stained with methylene 
blue, the total area of section, area of the damaged 
site, and area of preserved grey matter were measured 
at the distance from 1 mm to 10 mm caudally and 
rostrally from the hemisection plane [12]. On day 
60 after the intervention, the number of neurons was 
calculated on sections stained with methylene blue. 
The number of oligodendrocytes was determined af-
ter immunohistochemical reaction with O4 antibodies 
(1:100, R&D Systems, Inc.) with red fl uorescent label 
Cy3 (1:300, Dianova). For nucleus identifi cation, the 
sections were incubated in a medium with fl uorescent 
dye Dapi (1:1000; Dianova). The number of myelin 
fi bers was determined at a distance of 5 mm rostrally 
and caudally from the hemisection plane after staining 
of semithin sections of the spinal cord with toluidine 
blue. Migration of cells stained with antibodies to hu-
man cell nuclei (HNu, 1:100, Chemicon) was evalu-
ated 30 days after their transplantation into the site 
of damage. Immunocytochemical examination was 
performed using an Axioscope 2 fl uorescent micro-
scope and Image J software. Statistical signifi cance 
of obtained data was assessed using ANOVA, Mann–
Whitney, and Student tests.
RESULTS
Thirty days after spinal cord hemisection and trans-
plantation of OE cells, groups of cells labeled with 
human nucleus marker (HNu+-cells) were found in the 
zone of damage (Fig. 1). We showed that these cells 
migrated up to the distance of 6.20±1.23 mm in the 
rostral direction and up to 5.80±1.08 mm in the caudal 
direction through the spinal cord; however, according 
to previously obtained data, glial cells from OE trans-
planted to the spinal cord start to migrate 4 h after 
transplantation and by day 7 pass a distance equal to 
1 mm in both rostral and caudal directions [4].
After injection of OE cells into the site of he-
misection, the area of damage was smaller than in the 
control on days 30 and 60. Signifi cant changes in the 
area of damage were observed 7 mm rostrally from the 
damage site 30 days after intervention (Fig. 2, b). Six-
ty days after transplantation, the cross-section area at a

distance of 3 mm rostrally from the hemisection plane 
surpassed that in control animals by 15.3% (p<0.05). 
The area of preserved grey matter also tended to in-
crease 30 and 60 days after transplantation of OE cells 
(Fig. 2, a, c).
The number of O4+ cells in the immediate prox-
imity to the site of damage decreased almost twofold 
on day 60 (Fig. 3), while the number of O4+-cells at a 
distance of 3 mm rostrally from the hemisection plane 
at this term exceeded the corresponding parameter in 
control animals by 22.8% (p<0.05, Fig. 3). These data 
are important for understanding such substantial results 
of cell therapy of spinal cord injuries as maintenance 
of oligodendrocyte structure and function, inhibition 
of posttraumatic demyelination, and stimulation of 
remyelination of nerve fi bers.
Motor function in the experimental animals was 
repeatedly evaluated from 21 day to 53 day after he mi-
section and transplantation of human OE cells. During 
this period, motor function in rats receiving transplan-
tation of OE moderately improved according to BBB 
test by 12.8% on average, in comparison with control 
animals (Fig. 4). Our results agree with previous data 
obtained in similar studies [8].
It should to be emphasized, that the described im-
provement in motor functions directly correlated with 
an increase in oligodendrocyte number during spinal 
cord regeneration. These data can serve as the basis 
for understanding the role of oligodendroglia in one 
of major regeneration processes during cell therapy 
of spinal cord lesions, inhibition of demyelination of 
impaired nerve fi bers and simulation of remyelination 
of regenerating axons in spinal tracts.
The increase in the number of oligodendrocytes 
after transplantation of olfactory epithelium cells into 
the damaged spinal cord can be explained by production 
of neurotrophic factors essential for oligodendrocyte 
survival by transplanted cells migrating to appreciable 
distances in the undamaged rostral and caudal parts of 
the spinal cord. The possibility of stimulation of differ-
entiation and proliferation of oligodendrocyte progeni-
tors by transplanted cells cannot also be excluded [6].
Remyelination of regenerated axons by Schwann 
cells after spinal cord damage is described in a num-
ber of reports. According to these studies, transported 
glial cells cannot form myelin sheaths, but stimulate 
migration of Schwann cells into the area of spinal cord 
damage and create microenvironment maintaining fi -
ber myelination by Schwann cells [3,5,10,13].
Thus, according to our fi ndings and previously 
obtained results, remyelination of ascending and de-
scending spinal tracts and regenerating axons at the 
site of spinal cord damage during cell therapy is medi-
ated by trophic interaction between transplanted glial 
OE cells, myelin-producing oligodendroglial cells, and 
Schwann cells.
