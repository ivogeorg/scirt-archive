Expansion of the secondary injury following primary 
spinal cord injury is a major pathological event that 
increases destruction in the spinal cord, so measures 
to reduce secondary injury are needed. Our previous 
study demonstrated that, at the front of the expanding 
secondary injury in the spinal cord, there is an 
ischemic area in which many neurons can still be 
rescued. Therefore, enhancement of blood circulation 
in the cord may be helpful, and indeed, we found 
that a traditional Chinese medicine, shu-xue-tong, 
efficiently reduces the secondary injury. The aim of 
the present study was to investigate the effect of 
reducing fibrinogen with Batroxobin, a drug widely 
used clinically for ischemia, in rats with spinal cord 
contusion. We found that both 2 and 4 Batroxobin 
units (BU)/kg efficiently decreased the plasma 
fibrinogen, and 2 BU/kg significantly increased spinal 
blood flow, enhanced neuronal survival, mitigated 
astrocyte and microglia activation, and improved 
locomotor recovery. However, 4 BU/kg had no 
effect on the secondary spinal cord injury. These 
data suggest that Batroxobin has multiple beneficial 
effects on spinal cord injury, indicating a potential 
clinical application.

INtrODUctION
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious problem and has 
been intensively studied[1]. Secondary injury after primary 
spinal cord damage plays an important role in the 
final outcome. Pathological vascular changes and the 
subsequent events are crucial for the development of 
secondary injury[2-4]. Destruction of the blood-spinal cord 
barrier leads to massive leakage of blood components, 
initiating inflammation and gliosis[5]. Post-traumatic 
ischemia resulting from tissue compression, thrombosis 
and vasospasm causes progressive neuronal death, 
and shows a direct linear relationship with the severity of 
injury[6-8]. Our previous study has shown that two ischemic 
zones occur at the front of the expanding secondary injury. 
In the zone adjacent to the injury, most of the neurons have 
degenerated or disappeared, whereas in the farther zone, 
although there are clear signs of ischemia, the morphology 
of the Nissl bodies appears not much changed, indicating 
that these neurons can be rescued by improving the blood 
flow[9]. This explains the finding by Johnson et al. that 
fluarizine, a vasodilator, ameliorates ischemia in the cord 
and enhances neurological recovery in rabbits[10]. Thus, 
enhancement of blood flow in the cord could be an efficient 
strategy for decreasing secondary injury. Our subsequent 
study using a traditional Chinese medicine, shu-xue-tong, 
which promotes blood flow, demonstrated the efficacy 
of this strategy[11]. Therefore, in this study, we further 
investigated the possibility of making use of innate blood-
borne factors. 
Fibr inogen is a 340-kDa protein secreted by 
hepatocytes and is present in the blood at a high 
concentration. Upon activation of the coagulation cascade, 
both the α and β chains of fibrinogen are cleaved by 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 501–508502
thrombin to form fibrin polymer. The latter, by interacting 
with platelets, accomplishes the process of blood clotting[12]. 
Furthermore, recent studies reported that fibrinogen leaking 
from ruptured blood vessels triggers the activation of 
astrocytes[13] and microglia[14], suggesting its involvement in 
the development of secondary SCI. 
Batroxobin is a thrombin-like serine protease from 
the venom of the snake Bothrops moojeni. In contrast to 
thrombin, Batroxobin only cleaves the α chain of fibrinogen, 
resulting in the production of a fibrin monomer, which has 
poorer linking ability than the polymer and thus decreases 
the blood fibrinogen and promotes blood flow[15]. Therefore, 
Batroxobin has been successfully used in various 
ischemic disorders, such as stroke, deep-vein thrombosis, 
myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial thrombosis, and 
sudden deafness[16-18]. Its effect on SCI, however, has not 
been studied. Given the important role fibrinogen plays in 
the pathology of SCI, the present study was designed to 
investigate whether Batroxobin has a beneficial effect on 
SCI in rats and its possible clinical application. 
MAtErIALs AND MEtHODs 
Animal Model  
All the animal experiments were approved by the Animal 
Care and Use Committee of the Fourth Military Medical 
University. Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) were 
anesthetized with 1% sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). A 
30–40 mm dorsal midline incision was made followed by 
bilateral laminectomy. SCI was made at the T8 vertebra 
(corresponding to segment T9) by lateral crushing. The 
widely-used weight-dropping device mimics the clinical 
situation of SCI, but often causes profuse bleeding in the 
dorsal funiculus that spreads between the fasciculi to an 
unpredictable degree. To improve the consistency of the 
experimental data, Tazlaff developed a manual graded 
forceps lateral crush SCI model[19]. Because it is difficult 
to manually ensure vertical orientation of the forceps and 
equal degrees of compression bilaterally, we designed a 
mechanical version in which a pair of forceps was mounted 
on a stereotaxic device and its two blades could be closed 
simultaneously from both sides. After exposure of the dura 
mater, the forceps were first pressed until their tips met, 
then lowered and aligned with the midline of the cord. 
Then the blades were spread, lowered along both sides of 
the cord for the desired distance, closed to a preset gap 
between the blades (0.5 mm), and compression maintained 
for 20 s. 
Batroxobin Administration  
According to the supplier’s instructions (DF-521, Tobishi), 
10 Batroxobin units (BU) is recommended as the regular 
initial dose, and 5 BU as the maintenance dose. Only in 
cases with plasma fibrinogen >400 mg/dl or acute hearing 
loss can 20 BU be used as the initial dose. Considering the 
differences between human and rat, we used 2 and 4 BU/
kg (corresponding to 10.7 and 21.4 BU for a 60-kg patient). 
Batroxobin is recommended to be administered once every 
other day. Considering the drastic changes that occur right 
after the injury, particularly the spread of bleeding, we 
expected that 12 h after injury was needed for the changes 
to stabilize. Our pilot experiment showed that by that 
time the hemorrhage had stopped, with only a little fresh 
bleeding. Since Batroxobin does not enhance bleeding[15], 
we injected it at 12 h, 3 days and 5 days after SCI via the 
tail vein. Saline was injected as the control. 
Plasma Fibrinogen Assay 
Two hours after the last dose of Batroxobin, blood samples 
were collected for a coagulation test (n = 4/group). The 
concentration of fibrinogen was determined using an 
Automated Coagulation Analysis Instrument (STA Compact, 
Stago Co., France).
Laser-Doppler Flowmetry  
Spinal cord blood flow was measured 2 h after the last 
Batroxobin dose using a MoorLab laser-Doppler flow-
meter (wavelength, 780 nm) and an MP4 probe (Moorlab 
Instruments, Devon, England). The laminectomized animals 
from the saline or Batroxobin-treated groups were mounted 
onto a stereotactic instrument and fixed to stabilize the 
vertebral column. The laser-Doppler probe was affixed to 
a micromanipulator and placed perpendicular to the cord, 
barely touching the dorsal surface of the dura mater. The 
laser-Doppler signals were recorded and analyzed with 
Moorsoft for Windows Ver. 1.31. The final value for each rat 
was obtained from the average of 10 consecutive spikes 
over 1 min of recording. 
Immunohistochemistry and Morphological Analysis  
At 7 days post-SCI, after behavioral analysis, the 
Hong Fan, et al.    Protective effects of Batroxobin on SCI in rats 503
animals were overdose anesthetized with pentobarbital 
sodium and perfused intracardially with 400 mL 4% cold 
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Then a 
2-cm spinal cord segment containing the lesion site at its 
center was removed and kept in 25% sucrose until it sank. 
Eight sets of serial sagittal sections (14 μm thick) from each 
cord were prepared on a cryostat. For immunostaining, the 
slides were blocked with 0.01 mol/L PBS containing 0.3% 
Triton X-100 and 3% BSA for 30 min (Triton X-100 was 
omitted from the blocking solution for Neurocan staining), 
and incubated with rabbit anti-NeuN (1:500, Millipore, 
Temecula, CA), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) (1:1 000, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), rabbit 
anti-GFAP (1:2 000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-
Iba-1 (1:1 000, Wako, Osaka), or mouse anti-Neurocan 
(1:250, Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature overnight. 
After washes with PBS, sections were incubated with the 
corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 
Fluor 594 (donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:800, Molecular Probes, 
Eugene, OR) or Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey anti-mouse IgG, 
1:500, Molecular Probes) for 4 h at room temperature in the 
dark. The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 
(1:5 000, Sigma). In each animal, five sections separated 
by 100 μm (a middle section that cut through the central 
canal, two left and two right of the midline) were mounted 
on the same slide. NeuN- and Iba-1-stained sections 
were examined and photographed under a fluorescence 
microscope (BX51, Olympus). The other immunostained 
sections were examined and photographed under a 
confocal microscope (FV1000, Olympus). To quantify the 
immunostaining, the lesion area was defined by the inner 
lining of GFAP-stained astrocytes, and the lesion size was 
calculated by converting the pixels into millimeters using 
Photoshop CS3. The immunofluorescence intensity (IFI) 
of GFAP, Neurocan and Iba-1 was measured in the first 
three zones adjacent to the lesion center by Image-Pro 
Plus5.0 (IPP5.0), and then divided by the area of the zones 
respectively.
Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) Evaluation of 
Locomotion 
The BBB scale was used to evaluate rat open-field 
locomotion at 1 day before, and 1, 4, and 7 days after SCI. 
Animals in a standard open-field were observed for the 
following criteria: extent of joint movement, weight support, 
and stepping/walking behavior of the hindlimbs. Functional 
scores ranging from 0 (no observable hindlimb movement) 
to 21 (normal locomotion) were assigned for both hindlimbs 
by two independent observers blinded to the experiments. 
The mean value was calculated as the main functional 
outcome. Scoring was performed in a maximum period of 
5 min.
rump-height Index (rHI) Assay  
A runway bar was made of a wooden plate (1500 mm 
long, 120 mm wide, and 16 mm thick). The rats were 
video-recorded (Samsung S600) at 30 frames/s 1 day 
prior to and 1, 4, and 7 days post-SCI. Frames in which 
the animals were in defined phases of locomotion were 
selected. The RHI is defined as the height of the rump (the 
vertical distance from the dorsal aspect of the tail base 
to the beam), normalized to the thickness of the beam 
measured along the same vertical line. Measurements 
were performed with Photoshop CS3. To minimize the 
variations of pre-surgery RHI, the standardized RHI (SRHI, 
SRHI = RHIpost-SCI/RHIpre-SCI) was used for comparisons.
Footprint Analysis  
Footprint analysis was conducted 1 day before and 7 days 
after SCI. The plantar surface of both hindlimbs of each rat 
was colored black and the dorsal surface red with non-toxic 
ink. The rats were then allowed to run on a white paper (89.1 
cm × 10.5 cm); the red and/or black ink printed onto the 
paper was considered as one set of footprints. Stride length 
(SL) was defined as the distance between the centers of 
adjacent footprints. The SL of both hindlimbs was measured 
and the average of 5–8 SLs from each rat was used. The 
stride length factor (SLF) was calculated as SLF = (SLpre-SCI 
−SL post-SCI)/SLpre-SCI and was used for statistical analysis. 
statistical Analysis  
All the morphological measurements were made using 
Adobe Photoshop CS3, and all data were analyzed by 
SPSS l6.0 (Chicago, IL). Data are presented as mean ± 
SEM, and were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed 
by Dunnett’s post hoc test, except for BBB scoring which 
was further analyzed by the Bonferroni post hoc test as 
recommended[20]. P <0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.

Effects of Batroxobin on Plasma Fibrinogen and spinal 
cord Blood-Flow  
Two hours after the last injection, peripheral blood samples 
were collected to determine the effects of Batroxobin 
on plasma fibrinogen. The results showed that 2 BU/kg 
decreased the fibrinogen by 30.64 ± 4.20% (P <0.05) and 
4 BU/kg by 55.42 ± 4.14% (P <0.01) (n = 4 rats, Fig. 1A), 
demonstrating its efficacy in removing blood fibrinogen. To 
assess whether spinal cord blood-flow was improved by 
Batroxobin, laser Doppler scanning was performed at the 
lesion site 2 h after the last Batroxobin injection. The results 
showed that 2 BU/kg increased the blood-flow by 43.80 ± 
7.70 % (n = 4 rats, P <0.05, Fig. 1B). However, 4 BU/kg did 
not significantly change the blood-flow (n = 4 rats, Fig. 1B).
Effects of Batroxobin on Neuronal survival and Lesion 
size
NeuN-immunoreactive neurons were counted in animals 
sacrificed at 7 days after SCI. In areas both rostral and 
caudal to the lesion, five lines parallel to the astrocytic 
circumference of the lesion site were drawn, each 
separated by 250 μm, and the data from both sides of 
each zone were combined in the subsequent analysis. The 
NeuN-positive cells were counted in each zone (Fig. 2A–
C). The results showed that 2 BU/kg increased the survival 
of neurons adjacent to the lesion site as evidenced by the 
Fig.1. Effects of Batroxobin on plasma fibrinogen and spinal cord blood-flow. A: Reduction of fibrinogen by 2 BU/kg and 4 BU/kg. B:

increase of NeuN-positive cells by 137.28 ± 36.07% in 
zone 1, 84.28 ± 27.18% in zone 2, and 80.0 ± 19.03% in zone 3 
(n = 6 rats, P <0.05, Fig. 2D). The neurons in zones 4 and 5 
appeared normal. No significant increase of NeuN-positive 
cells was found in the 4 BU/kg group (Fig. 2D). Moreover, 
2 BU/kg reduced the lesion area by 23.54 ± 2.12%, while 
4 BU/kg did not (Fig. 2E). These results indicated that 2 
BU/kg, but not 4 BU/kg, promoted the survival of neurons 
adjacent to the lesion and reduced the lesion size.
Since the neurons in zones 4 and 5 appeared normal, 
only zones 1–3 were investigated in the subsequent 
experiments. 
Effects of Batroxobin on Astrocyte Activation  
To assess the effects of Batroxobin on the activation of 
astrocytes, immunohistochemistry for GFAP and Neurocan 
(another marker of reactive astrocytes to support the 
results from GFAP staining) was performed. In saline 
controls, intense GFAP immunoreactivity was seen in zone 
1, and this decreased from zones 1–3 (Fig. 3A). But 2 BU/
kg decreased the IFI of GFAP by 60.06 ± 4.83% (n = 6 
rats, P <0.05, Fig. 3B, D). No significant change of GFAP 
immunoreactivity was found in the 4 BU/kg group (Fig. 3C, 
D). Further, the IFI of Neurocan was decreased by 75.22 ± 
3.00% (P <0.01) in the 2 BU/kg group, and by 46.50 ± 6.71% 
(P <0.01) in the 4 BU/kg group (n = 6 rats, Fig. 4). Taken 
together, these data suggested that 2 BU/kg alleviated the 
astrocyte activation.
Effects of Batroxobin on Microglia Activation  
To define the effects of Batroxobin on the activation of 
microglia, immunostaining for Iba-1 was performed at 7 
days post-SCI. In saline controls, numerous Iba-1 positive 
cells were found in zone 1 and decreased from zones 1–3 
(Fig. 5A). Measurement of the IFI of Iba-1 in the first three 
adjacent zones showed a reduction of 29.07 ± 7.83% in 
the 2 BU/kg group (n = 6 rats, P <0.05, Fig 5B, D). But no 
significant reduction of Iba-1 IFI/area was found in the 4 
UB/kg group (Fig. 5C, D). These results suggested that 2 
BU/kg effectively alleviated microglia activation.
Effects of Batroxobin on Locomotor recovery after scI 
To test whether Batroxobin is beneficial to the functional 
recovery from SCI, we evaluated locomotion by BBB 
scoring and RHI assay at 1, 4 and 7 days after SCI, and 
the footprint test at 7 days after SCI. The BBB scores 
showed that at 4 and 7 days, 2 BU/kg-treated rats showed 
significant improvement (Fig. 6A). Similarly, the 2 BU/kg-
treated rats showed higher lift of the hind limbs at 4 and 
7 days as evaluated by the RHI assay (Fig. 6B). The SLF

in the footprint test showed a 63.67 ± 12.1% decrease at 
7 days in the 2 BU/kg group (n = 6 rats, P <0.05, Fig. 6C). 
However, 4 BU/kg did not have any significant effects on 
the BBB scores, RHI and SLF (Fig. 6).
DIscUssION
SCI has a high incidence and is a major concern for 
society, patients, and their families. Among the various 
types of SCI, contusion has the highest incidence. 
Fortunately, early surgical intervention is very successful[21]. 
Following the primary spinal cord injury, secondary injury 
expands continuously for ~4 weeks, so understanding 
the mechanism and finding measures to control it are of 
great importance. Our previous study demonstrated that 
an ischemic zone occurs at the front of the expending 
secondary injury[9], and this triggers the advance of the

Hong Fan, et al.    Protective effects of Batroxobin on SCI in rats 507
injury. We further showed that enhancing spinal cord blood 
circulation indeed reduces the secondary injury[11]. Using 
the same strategy, here we studied the effect of Batroxobin, 
a drug widely used in various ischemic disorders[16-18], in 
reducing the secondary SCI. Fibrinogen is a blood-borne 
molecule involved in both circulation and glial reaction 
after SCI[12-14], and Batroxobin is a defibrinogating agent. 
Moreover, Batroxobin decreases blood viscosity without 
affecting other coagulating proteins such as factors V, 
VIII and XIII, as well as platelets and endothelial cells[15]. 
One of the concerns for Batroxobin administration in 
SCI is the possibility of inducing bleeding in the injured 
cord. It has been reported that its downstream product, 
fibrinopeptide-A, forms an unstable clot and even shortens 
the bleeding time in vivo[15,22]. In the present study, we 
demonstrated that 2 BU/kg promoted neuronal survival, 
alleviated the activation of astrocytes and microglia, and 
improved locomotor recovery. But surprisingly, 4 BU/kg had 
no effect, neither good nor bad. In humans, only one dose 
is allowed on special occasions. Apparently, 4 BU/kg is an 
overdose in rats. The mechanisms of the null effect remain 
to be elucidated.
In conclusion, since Batroxobin is clinically widely 
used, its beneficial effects in reducing secondary spinal 
cord injury can be transplanted to the bedside.
