The integrity of the neuronal membrane is crucial for its function and cellular survival; thus, ineffective repair 
of damaged membranes may be one of the key elements underlying the neuronal degeneration and overall 
functional loss that occurs after spinal cord injury (SCi). it has been shown that polyethylene glycol (PEG) can 
reseal axonal membranes following various injuries in multiple in vitro and in vivo injury models. in addition, 
PEG may also directly prevent the effects of mitochondria-derived oxidative stress on intracellular components. 
Thus, PEG repairs mechanically injured cells by at least two distinct pathways: resealing of the disrupted 
plasma membrane and direct protection of mitochondria. Besides repairing primary membrane damage, 
PEG treatment also results in significant attenuation of oxidative stress, likely due to its capacity to reseal 
the membrane, thereby breaking the cycle of cellular damage and free-radical production. Based on this, in 
addition to the practicality of its application, we expect that PEG may be established as an effective treatment 
for SCi where membrane disruption and mitochondrial damage are implicated.

Introduction
Membrane disruption is common during all mechanical 
injuries to cells, and repair of the damaged membrane is 
essential for functional recovery[1-4]. This article reviews the 
significance of membrane disruption and the development 
of an effective membrane-repair agent, polyethylene glycol 
(PEG), in treating mechanically injured neurons, specifically 
pertaining to spinal cord injury (SCi). 
Membrane Disruption Leads to Functional Deficits
The plasma membrane serves many functions, including 
protecting the cell from extracellular environment and 
maintaining a functional intracellular environment. Selective 
permeability and membrane ion pumps maintain an 
unequal distribution of ions across the membrane and the 
resulting resting membrane potential. When the integrity 
of the neuronal membrane is disrupted, ions and other 
molecules immediately leak into and out of the cell down 
their electrochemical gradients. influx of extracellular 
molecules such as Ca2+ can have lethal effects on the 
cell by activating proteases, generating free oxidative 
radicals, disrupting mitochondrial metabolism, and 
activating apoptotic pathways[5-12]. influx of Na+ leads to 
the functional loss of neurons as the membrane can no 
longer be polarized or excited. intracellular accumulation of 
Ca2+ and Na+ also leads to formation of the mitochondrial 
permeability transition pore, release of cytochrome 
C, liberation of reactive oxidative species (RoS) from 
mitochondria, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, 
and inhibition of ATP synthesis[6-9]. 
Riyi Shi.    PEG repairs membrane damage and enhances functional recovery 461
The effects of mechanical disruption on neuronal 
membranes have been extensively studied both in 
vitro and in vivo[4,11,13-24]. A strong correlation between 
membrane resealing and functional recovery, as well as 
neuronal survival, has long been established[4,13,17,18]. it has 
been shown that enhancing membrane repair in rodent 
spinal cord axons using various physical, chemical, and 
biochemical interventions is associated with significant 
functional recovery[4,18,19,25-27]. Membrane resealing is 
required for both the long-term survival of the cell as well 
as the prevention of further degeneration in severed axons 
or those crushed axons progressing to secondary axotomy. 
Early repair increases the prospect that the neuron will 
survive and functionally recover; however, if the axon is 
severed, recovery may require axonal regrowth or plasticity. 
Shi, in previous studies, found that significant 
membrane damage exists in the spinal cord axons at 1 h, 
3 days, and 7 days after controlled compression injury 
in vivo[28]. More importantly, the location of axonal injury 
expands from the original 2 mm crush site to a distance 
of 20 mm in each direction at 7 days post-compression[28]. 
These observations further highlight the importance of 
axonal membrane disruption in traumatic SCi. 
Unfortunately, in vivo tissue conditions produced 
by SCi are not conducive to membrane repair. it is well 
established that membrane repair is a Ca2+-dependent 
process. Specifically, membrane resealing is significantly 
inhibited when Ca2+ falls below 0.5 mmol/L[17]. Young and 
co-workers[29] showed three decades ago that extracellular 
Ca2+ activity ([Ca2+]o) decreases from 1.2 mmol/L before 
injury, to between 0.01 and 0.1 mmol/L within minutes after 
SCi in cats. This low level of Ca2+ persists for several hours, 
especially evident in the central region of a compression 
lesion. Similar [Ca2+]o changes were reported in a dog SCi 
model[30]. The reduction of [Ca2+]o resulting from SCi may 
prevent damaged axons from resealing. on the other hand, 
the reduced [Ca2+]o, though unable to trigger membrane 
repair, is still several magnitudes higher than the level of 
intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). This likely supports a prolonged 
influx of Ca2+ into injured cells with disrupted membranes 
causing consequent axonal degeneration. if axonal injury 
is physically close to the cell body, this may ultimately 
lead to the death of the cell itself, as has been shown 
through in vitro studies[31,32]. Therefore, the inability of the 
membrane to reseal following injury may, in part, contribute 
to the progressive degeneration that has been reported 
in mammalian SCi; thus, it is reasonable to suggest that 
accelerating membrane resealing might prove to be an 
effective acute treatment for SCi.
PEG-mediated Membrane Repair
PEG as a Cell Fusogen
PEG, a hydrophilic polymer, is a known fusogen[33]. For 
example, PEG has been used to fuse PC-12 cells to form 
giant cells and facilitate electrophysiological recordings[34]. 
PEG has also been used to fuse the ends of severed 
invertebrate giant axons in vitro[35]. The ability of PEG to 
fuse cell membranes is attributed to its hydrophilic nature. 
The mechanism by which it acts is not well understood, 
but it is thought to dehydrate cell membranes, allowing for 
protein and lipid structural elements to resolve into each 
other and therefore eliminating membrane breaches[36-
38]. in addition, as a surfactant, PEG may also encourage 
membrane resealing by reducing membrane surface 
tension and enhancing membrane fluidity, conditions 
favorable for membrane resealing[4]. 
PEG-mediated Membrane Repair of in vitro 
Primary Spinal Cord Injury
Based on the ability of PEG to fuse the cell membrane, 
we theorized that PEG is capable of fusing completely 
severed strips of spinal cord white matter. Although this 
may not be very clinically relevant, it would be a proof-of-
principle demonstrating PEG’s ability to repair damaged 
membranes in a simple injury model. The highly sensitive 
double sucrose gap recording (DSGR) device has been 
an indispensable technique for monitoring acute recovery 
after SCi[17,25,39]. This method has allowed unprecedented 
resolution in recording compound action potentials (CAPs) 
using isolated strips of ventral white matter from adult 
guinea pig spinal cord[25,40]. 
Here is a brief description of the technique used to 
evaluate impulse conduction using the DSGR device[40]. A 
strip of ventral white matter, ~38 mm long, is isolated from 
guinea pigs weighing ~400 g. once the cord is mounted on 
the recording device and the CAP recording has stabilized, 
the cord is completely transected between the stimulating 
and recording electrodes, eliminating the propagation of 
CAPs. The two segments of spinal cord are then carefully 
aligned and gently pressed together. PEG (MW ~2 000, 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 460–466462
50% w/w in distilled water) is applied directly to the injury 
site for ~2 min in a continuous stream. While the transected 
untreated cord (aligned and pressed together without PEG) 
never recovers CAP conduction, the PEG-treated cord 
typically recovers within 5 min of PEG application[40]. An 
identical procedure has been used to treat the compressed 
cord. Similar to a transection injury, a severe compression 
completely eliminates the CAP. A small and variable level 
of spontaneous recovery occurs within ~1 h in the absence 
of PEG. However, CAP amplitude in the PEG-treated 
cord is 7 times that recorded from injured but untreated 
preparations[25]. 
in spinal cord transection experiments, the anatomic 
continuity of fused axons has been examined by injecting 
intracellular markers (fluorescently labeled dextrans) into 
each end of the spinal cord strip. in PEG-fused cords, 
variable numbers of labeled axons are continuous across 
the original transection plane, while such a phenomenon 
is never observed in control (injured without PEG) cords. 
High-resolution light microscopy (1-µm plastic sections) 
has also revealed axonal continuity across the transection 
plane in PEG-treated cords[40]. These observations 
demonstrate that the restoration of physiological function is 
accompanied by axonal reconnection. 
in addition to reconnecting severed axons, PEG 
has also been shown to repair membrane damage in 
compressed or crushed axons, a more clinically-relevant 
injury. Anatomical sealing of PEG-treated compression 
injuries to spinal cord nerve fibers was assessed using 
a dye exclusion test[17,18]. When the high-molecular 
weight label, horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 40K MW), 
is administered to the extracellular milieu it diffuses into 
injured axons wherever there is a break in the membrane. 
The cord crush procedure results in numerous labeled 
axons, while the density of HRP-labeled axons is 
significantly reduced in crushed cords treated with PEG[18]. 
This morphological evidence of axolemmal resealing 
is associated with significantly enhanced recovery of 
physiological conduction in compressed cords following 
PEG treatment[41]. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that PEG enhances 
the resealing of the cut end of a completely transected 
axon, a mechanical injury that produces a much larger 
membrane breach at the focus of the injury than a 
compression injury[4]. Specifically, PEG appears to be able 
to promote resealing of membrane disruptions that are 
equivalent to the diameters of axons that range from less 
than 1 mm to several micrometers[4]. it is understandable 
that severed axons have to first seal the membrane of the 
proximal stump to stop the degeneration and survive the 
injury, an indispensable step to allow subsequent axonal 
regeneration. in light of this, it is reasonable to state 
that PEG-mediated axolemmal resealing ensures and 
contributes to axonal regeneration. 
it is worth pointing out that although PEG is capable 
of reconnecting severed axons in ex vivo preparations, it 
is unlikely that this mechanism plays a major role during 
in vivo SCi. This is because, as described by Shi and 
colleagues[26], such axonal reconnection after transection 
requires manipulation (aligning and gently pressing 
together at the two cut ends), which is not possible in vivo. 
Therefore, PEG-mediated repair of membrane breaches, 
as well as resealing of the proximal cut end is likely to be 
the main mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects 
seen in PEG treatment in vivo. Since compression and 
transection usually coexist following physical insults in SCi, 
these findings further underscore the effectiveness of PEG 
in repairing membrane damage and promoting structural 
and functional recovery in CNS trauma.
PEG Reduces Secondary Spinal Cord Injury
We have shown that PEG not only repairs membrane 
disruption, primary damage, but also strikingly reduces 
the elevation of RoS secondary to mechanical injury. 
Specifically, application of PEG significantly reduces 
superoxide production at 1 h post-injury. The level of lipid 
peroxidation is also significantly decreased as a result 
of PEG treatment[42-44]. This is important since oxidative 
injury is a key component of secondary cascades in the 
pathogenesis of traumatic spinal cord and brain injury[45-48]. 
We have shown that PEG has no intrinsic free radical-
scavenging abilities[42]. Therefore it is probable that PEG-
mediated reduction in oxidative stress is dependent on 
its capacity to seal the membrane, thereby breaking the 
cycle of cellular damage and free-radical production. in this 
interpretation, PEG repairs membrane damage, reducing 
Ca2+ influx, inhibiting the formation of the mitochondrial 
permeability transition pore and associated oxidative 
stress, thereby preventing further increased membrane 
permeability that would be linked to the production of o2
- 
and H2o2
[7, 49].

PEG Repairs Spinal Cord Injury in vivo
The effects of PEG have also been examined after in 
vivo SCi[50-52]. In vivo testing allows for the assessment 
o f  recovery f rom behaviora l  def ic i ts ,  as wel l  as  
long-term studies. These studies were carried out 
using a well-established guinea-pig SCi model[50-53]. 
Specifically, PEG was applied topically for 2 min to 
completely exposed compression injuries in the mid-
thoracic region, either within 30 min or ~8 h following injury. 
A standardized compression injury to the cord completely 
abolished the cutaneous trunci muscle (CTM) reflex in 
all animals on both sides below the level of the crush. 
The somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) was also 
completely eliminated in all animals. Recovery of SSEP 
conduction was not observed in any control injured animals 
in up to one month of monitoring. All of the guinea-pigs 
treated with PEG, either within 30 min or 8 h post-SCi, 
showed measurable SSEP conduction. Less than 17% of 
the control animals recovered any level of CTM reflex after 
SCi while 100% of the PEG-treated animals recovered 
variable levels of CTM function, regardless of when the 
PEG was applied[50]. in addition to behavioral recovery, 
PEG treatment also resulted in significant reduction of 
injury size[53]. The fact that the delayed application of PEG 
(8 h post-injury) still leads to significant functional and 
anatomical recovery is consistent with an earlier study 
which showed that membrane damage continues to exist 
up to 7 days after spinal cord compression in vivo[28]. Thus, 
PEG-mediated axonal repair would be possible for an 
extended period of time post-injury. in addition to guinea-
pig, significant beneficial behavioral and anatomical results 
of PEG have been found in several rat SCi models[54-56] 
which further highlights the effectiveness of PEG in treating 
traumatic SCi in different animal models. 
in addition to the beneficial effect in the acute stage 
described above, we have found that apoptosis, a major 
component of secondary injury, is also suppressed after 
PEG treatment. Specifically, when applied locally and 
immediately following compression injury, PEG significantly 
reduces the number of apoptotic cells at 1 and 7 days 
following injury and treatment. Consistent with these 
findings, caspase-3 activity and cytochrome C release 
are also markedly reduced in PEG-treated compared to 
untreated groups[57]. This is consistent with our findings 
that PEG reduces oxidative stress, which is known to 
cause apoptosis after traumatic SCi[42-44]. This indicates 
that cells rescued by PEG at the acute stage do not later 
die by apoptosis. Since continuing cellular destruction 
through apoptotic cell death may play a critical role in the 
pathophysiology of SCi[58-60], these findings emphasize the 
importance of early intervention in modifying long-term 
biochemical and functional recovery after SCi. 
Several additional findings have emerged from in 
vivo studies: (1) Although the original experiments used 
local application, it is now clear that intravenous and 
subcutaneous injection of PEG are also effective, greatly 
enhancing the practicality of the treatment approach[51,52]. 
(2) When applied systemically, either by intravenous, 
intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous injection, fluorescein-
conjugated PEG specifically localizes to the site of injury in 
the guinea-pig spinal cord[52]. We hypothesize that there are 
probably at least two mechanisms for this phenomenon. 
First, PEG can gain access to the injury site through the 
ruptured blood vessels. Second, PEG may have a higher 
affinity for injured cells because the ruptured membrane 
may create an environment that attracts PEG. Regardless 
of the mechanisms, this phenomenon highlights several 
potential advantages in the use of PEG. one is that PEG 
can be used as a drug-carrier to deliver effective agents to 
the injury site in both SCi and traumatic brain injury. This 
can be accomplished by conjugating PEG to the desired 
compounds. Furthermore, a PEG-conjugated compound 
may retain its ability to reseal membranes in addition to the 
effect exerted by the compound to which it is conjugated. 
Veterinary clinical trials using naturally injured and 
neurologically complete paraplegic dogs have been 
completed[61]. intravenous injection of PEG (30% w/w) 
demonstrated noticeable improvements in voluntary 
ambulation, deep and superficial pain perception, 
proprioceptive placing of hindlimbs, and SSEP conduc-
tion compared to historical controls. The outcome 
measurements were monitored for 6–8 weeks. The results 
of this pilot trial provide evidence consistent with the notion 
that the injection of polymers in acute neurotrauma may be 
a simple and effective intervention during the acute phase 
of the injury. 
Two points related to the breadth of application of 
PEG in various nervous injuries are worth mentioning 
here. First, though most of our published work is geared 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 460–466464
towards spinal cord axons, PEG has also been shown 
to repair peripheral nerves both in vitro and in vivo[62]. 
Specifically, PEG treatment greatly enhances functional 
recovery following compression injury of sciatic nerves in 
vivo. Second, since many similarities exist between brain 
and spinal cord traumatic injury, it is perhaps not surprising 
that PEG has been recently shown to significantly alleviate 
anatomical and functional loss in traumatic brain injury[63]. 
This suggests that PEG may be an effective agent for many 
other mechanical injuries where membrane disruption is 
implicated. 
Multiple Targets of PEG Treatment
in addition to repairing the plasma membrane, we have 
recently shown that PEG is also capable of directly 
repairing damaged mitochondria[43,64]. This conclusion is 
based on the following results. First, confocal microscopy 
using fluorescein-conjugated PEG revealed that PEG 
enters the cells of the injured spinal cord, placing the 
polymer in a position to directly interact with cellular 
organelles such as mitochondria [43].  Second, PEG 
attenuates the Ca2+-induced functional compromise of 
isolated normal spinal cord mitochondria in vitro[64,65]. The 
PEG-mediated effects include preventing oxidation of 
glutathione and mitochondrial swelling[43]. These results 
indicate that PEG may exert its neuroprotective effect 
through direct interaction with mitochondria in addition to its 
ability to rescue neurons and their axons by repairing the 
plasma membranes. 
in summary, based on our findings, we propose a 
hypothetical model for the neuroprotective action of PEG 
in the spinal cord after traumatic injury. Traumatic injury 
to the cord causes breaches in the neuronal membrane, 
allowing extracellular ions (such as Ca2+ and Na+) to enter 
the injured cells. This results in rapid organelle damage 
and possible acute cell death. The primary action of PEG is 
to immediately seal and progressively eliminate membrane 
disruptions. in the meantime, some PEG molecules enter 
the cell through openings in the membrane and interact 
with mitochondria, preventing formation of the mitochondrial 
permeability transition pore. This in turn prevents or 
reduces mitochondrial swelling, allows for maintenance 
of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibits 
cytochrome C release and the consequent depletion of 
antioxidant systems. Thus, PEG repairs mechanically-
injured cells by at least two distinct pathways: resealing of 
the disrupted plasma membrane and direct protection of 
mitochondria. 
Concluding Remarks and Suggestions of Future 
Research
Membrane disruption has serious downstream structural 
and functional consequences in the mechanical injury 
of neuronal tissue. PEG-mediated resealing of cell 
membranes is a practical method to repair or reverse 
the continuous cellular damage subsequent to injury and 
enhance functional recovery. A brief application of PEG 
not only reduces acute necrosis, but also apoptosis. in 
addition to the plasma membrane, PEG also directly 
protects mitochondria and preserves their function. Based 
on this, as well as the practicality of application, we expect 
that PEG may be established as an effective treatment 
not only for SCi, but also for mechanical injuries in other 
tissue types where membrane disruption and mitochondrial 
damage are implicated. 
Perhaps other beneficial therapies applied to the 
early injury may also enhance PEG’s benefits through 
separate and synergistic mechanisms of action[25]. Since 
the loss of the plasma membrane is not the only pathology 
present during traumatic injuries, future development of 
combination therapy, such as PEG combined with other 
recovery-promoting agents would prove beneficial for 
therapeutic efficacy. For example, PEG could be combined 
with agents that combat known secondary injuries 
such as demyelination, oxidative stress, and glutamate 
excitotoxicity.
