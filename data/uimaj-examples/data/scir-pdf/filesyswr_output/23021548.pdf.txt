Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a neurological problem that

Here, we give a step-by-step surgical protocol to perform SCI
restoration of locomotor ability: a freely swimming behavioral
analysis and anterograde axonal tracing in vivo (Becker et al.,

is measured each week after SCI until the 6th week (Becker

Journal of Genetics and Genomics 392010; Kroehne et al., 2011). Zebrafish thus has been adopted
as a model to study recovery from SCI due to their
in adult zebrafish. In addition, we describe two methods to
evaluate the success of the zebrafish SCI model and thecauses severe suffering and disability in patients. Currently, no
effective therapy exists. Experimental animal models have
been invaluable in increasing our knowledge of the molecular
bases underlying the inability of mammals to recover from
SCI. Such animal models include monkeys, rats and mice
subjected to surgical injury, involving compression lesion,
hemisection and complete transection (Mehanna et al., 2010;
Nout et al., 2012; Sakai et al., 2012). Adult zebrafish retains
the ability to regain a high level of neurogenesis, neurito-
after complete spinal cord transection (Becker et al., 1998; van
Raamsdonk et al., 1998a, 1998b; Becker and Becker, 2001;
Fawcett, 2006; Reimer et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2011b). The
adult zebrafish injury and regeneration model should be useful
for identification of beneficial genes and permissive epigenetic
modes of gene regulation, and thus pave the way to gain
insight into therapeutic venues for humans.
Although the zebrafish model has been used for many
years, the specific procedure for spinal cord transection, whichAdult zebrafish has a remarkable capability to recover from spinal cord injury, providing an excellent model for studying neuro-
regeneration. Here we list equipment and reagents, and give a detailed protocol for complete transection of the adult zebrafish spinal cord.
In this protocol, potential problems and their solutions are described so that the zebrafish spinal cord injury model can be more easily and
reproducibly performed. In addition, two assessments are introduced to monitor the success of the surgery and functional recovery: one
test to assess free swimming capability and the other test to assess extent of neuroregeneration by in vivo anterograde axonal tracing. In
the swimming behavior test, successful complete spinal cord transection is monitored by the inability of zebrafish to swim freely for 1
week after spinal cord injury, followed by the gradual reacquisition of full locomotor ability within 6 weeks after injury. As a morpho-
metric correlate, anterograde axonal tracing allows the investigator to monitor the ability of regenerated axons to cross the lesion site and
increasingly extend into the gray and white matter with time after injury, confirming functional recovery. This zebrafish model provides
a paradigm for recovery from spinal cord injury, enabling the identification of pathways and components of neuroregeneration.

et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2011). To trace regenerating axons past
the lesion site, biocytin is applied at the brainstem/spinal cord
junction so as to be internalized by severed axons and ante-
rogradely transported to their synapses (Becker and Becker,
2001; Yu et al., 2011a, 2011b). Axons labeled by biocytin
permit the evaluation of their potential to regrow across the
lesion site by visualizing the restoration of contacts distal to
the lesion site through the tracing of axons projecting from
various nuclei in the brain to their targets.

2.3. Animals
Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) should be about 6 months old
and 2.5e3 cm in length, although this could vary depending on
the health status of the fish and howwell they have been fed. The
health status is important for the success of the surgery and
batches of fish that do not recover well should not be used for
further experiments. Attempts to improve the health status of the
fish by maintenance with anti-fungal solution and antibiotics
have not been successful. Our fish were purchased from the

2.4.1. Preparation of zebrafish for surgery
1) Make a plate of crushed ice before the surgery. Make the
surface flat. Carve a 0.5 cm  2 cm plastic groove into the
ice. Place a piece of thin filter paper (2 cm  2 cm) onto
the groove so that the position of the fish will be fixed
during surgery (Fig. 2A).
2) Quickly place the zebrafish in tricaine solution. After
3e5 min, upon cessation of respiratory movements of theHuiyuan Aquatic Animals Company (Shantou, Guangdong,
China) and maintained on a 14 h light and 10 h dark cycle at
28C. The fish water contains anti-fungal agents, and should be
kept constant at pH 7.4. Lights come on in the fish room at 8 am.
Fish were fed with zebrafish food, described in the reagents list,
twice a day. Either males or females can be used for sham
surgery or SCI. The number of zebrafish needs to be calculated
before the start of the experiment, taking into consideration an
approximate 70%e80%of survival after surgery. Commercially
available zebrafish can vary considerably in health and thus
survival after SCI.
s aP. Fang et al. / Journal of Geneticopercula, transfer the fish into the filter paper-containing
groove on ice, placing the fish on its side with the head
pointing left.
!Caution If fish exhibits tremors on ice, prolong the time of
anaesthesia until the fish no longer moves. Only then the
surgical operation can proceed (Table 1).
2.4.2. SCI and sham surgery (performed under the
stereomicroscope)
1) Use a pair of forceps (11254-20) to remove 3e4 squamae
at a distance 4 mm caudal to the brainstem/spinal cord
transitional junction, then cut off the skin and muscle with
the larger spring scissor (15000-08) (Fig. 2B).
2) Expose the spinal cord of the fish using the blunt dissec-
tion microforceps (11274-20, 11254-20) (Fig. 2C).
!Caution Handling must be very gentle to avoid inadver-
tent injuries to the spinal cord, vertebrae or blood vessels. The
older the fish are, the better they take the surgery, but on the

fish.
3) Insert the minor spring scissor (15000-03) into the wound
carefully and completely transect the spinal cord
(Fig. 2D).
!Caution The transection must be done in a single cut.
Repeated cutting will prevent the zebrafish from recovering.
The operator must be very careful, during the surgery, to
avoid damaging the bone structures under the spinal cord,
which encompass the ventral vertebrae (centrum). The blade
of the minor spring scissors should avoid hitting these bones
during the transection procedure. If the bone vertebrae are
damaged, the chances for recovery after surgery are reduced
and/or lost.
4) Quickly seal the wound with Histoacryl, and place the
zebrafish back into the water. All injured fish need to be
kept individually (Fig. 2E).
!Caution Histoacryl quickly solidifies upon exposure to air.
Keep the bottleneck of the tube clean for the next use.

s a5) The sham surgery is performed identically to the SCI
surgery except that in the 2.4.2 3) step, the spinal cord is
only exposed but not transected.
!Caution Three days after surgery, the sham-injured fish
can be traced for swimming behavior, since the distance swum
by the sham-injured fish does not differ from the same fish
before surgery, as opposed to the fish with transection.
2.4.3. Maintenance of fish after SCI
1) Injured fish are kept individually in 28C water with anti-
fungal agents for 3 days after surgery. The water needs to
be changed completely daily until the fish are euthanized.
!Caution All surgical instruments should be cleaned with
75% ethanol after the surgery.
2) Three days after surgery, the fish are fed. Feeding before
this time is not recommended since the fish do not respond
to food. In addition, providing food that is not eaten may
increase fungal pollution, which will elevate the mortality
rate. It is advised to powder the food and blow it to the
zebrafish through a small pipette in front of the fish.
2.4.4. Analysis of free swimming behavior
Swimming abilities of spinal cord-injured zebrafish and
sham-injured zebrafish are evaluated weekly after SCI for 6
consecutive weeks. Since fish can vary slightly in their swim
speed, it is advisable to measure each fish before the surgery.
1) In each trial, zebrafish are individually placed with a soft
net into a brightly illuminated (100 lux) tank
(42 cm  30 cm  30 cm) filled with aquarium water
(5 cm deep) at 25C. A video camera records the trials
from above the tank.

swim paths in 10-min trials are recorded. Distances swum
during 5e10 min are measured for mean distances.
Experiments are performed at the same time (between
9:00 and 10:00 am) on all test days. It is sufficient to
record each zebrafish once.
!Caution The experimental operator should be blind to the
treatment of the animals.
2.4.5. Anterograde tracing of axons from the brainstem
The brainstem contains the neuronal cell bodies that regrow
severed axons. Biocytin is applied at the site indicated in
Fig. 2 in sham- and SCI-injured zebrafish directly after surgeryand at 3, 7, 11, 15, 18, 21, 30 and 42 days after surgery to
monitor axonal regrowth. Biocytin is applied to the fish
between 9:00 and 10:00 am and at least 3 fish are taken for
each time point.
1) Soak a piece of gelfoam (approximately 2 mm 
2 mm  2 mm) in the biocytin solution and separate it into
five equal pieces.
2) Make an incision immediately below the superior border
of branchia, which is the approximate site of the brain-
stem/spinal cord junction (for the position, see Fig. 2F).
The following manipulations are the same as steps 2) and
3) of 2.4.2 performed for SCI (Fig. 2G).
3) Place one piece of the gelfoam soaked in biocytin into the
new lesion site (Fig. 2H) and seal the wound with Histo-
acryl (Fig. 2I). Then place the fish back into the water.
4) After 24 h, collect the spinal cord tissue 0e4 mm caudal to
original lesion site and place the tissue for fixation into
freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde in PBS at 4C overnight.
5) Immerse tissue sample into 15% sucrose for 6 h at 4C and
then embed in O.C.T.
!Caution Bubbles need to be avoided during the
embedding.
6) Cut, in a cryostat, the spinal cord coronally into 25 mm thick
sections or longitudinally into 16 mm thick sections and
place several sections on a glass slide. Dry at 55C for 2 h.
7) After biocytin labeling, wash the sections in PBS 3 times
for 5 min each at room temperature. Biocytin is detected
by incubation with Streptavidin-Cy3 (1:200 in PBS) for
2 h at 37C. The sections are then rinsed in PBS 3 times
for 5 min each.

!Caution At least 3e4 fish in each group are recommended

group are recommended for analysis of swimming behavior.
3. RESULTS
Successful transection will yield the following results.
3.1. Fish posture
The sham and SCI fish will maintain a straight body
posture at all times after surgery. Fish with a “C” or “S”
shape are most likely the result of major damage (probably
from injury to the bones) and should not be used for further
experiments.
3.2. Swimming ability
In the swim test, we found no difference in 5-min swim
distance between sham-injured zebrafish (1501  94 cm) and
non-injured zebrafish (1514  58 cm) suggesting that the
sham injury did not influence swimming ability. Sham-injured
fish were able to swim freely within 3 days after surgery.
However, fish after SCI should not be able to swim freely for
one week if the transection was complete. In the first week,
fish start to regain their ability to swim, and such restoration
progresses gradually week by week. The swim distance
(174  14 cm) for the first week fish was on average only
11.6% of that of sham-injured zebrafish. Swim distance at the
second, third, and fourth week was 345  63 cm,
455  85 cm, 637  53 cm, respectively. The swim distance
of the fifth week fish (1171  96 cm) should be equal, on
Fig. 3. Weekly mean distances for a 5-min swim path following SCI.
Transection of the spinal cord induced complete loss of swimming ability.
However, from the first week after injury, the fish started to regain their ability
to swim. Such restoration gradually increased week by week. By the fifth week
after injury, the fish reached the peak of recovery in swimming ability when
compared to the same fish before SCI. Data represent the mean  SEM, n ¼ 9
for each group.

average, to about 78% of the sham-injured zebrafish (Fig. 3
and Videos S1eS6).
3.3. Anterograde tracing of regrown axons
Axonal regrowth across the lesion site becomes detectable
with time after SCI in coronal (Fig. 4) and longitudinal (Fig. 5)
views. Samples from day 0 post SCI serve as a negative
control, while samples from sham-injured fish serve as
a positive control. There are no traced axons in the 7 days post
injury group, indicating that axons had not regrown beyond the
lesion site by one week after SCI. By 11 days post injury,
occasional signals (red) are apparent in both coronal and
longitudinal sections. Then, biocytin-labeled axons continu-
ally extend over larger distances at 15, 18, 21, and 30 days
post injury (Figs. 4 and 5). By 42 days, lengths of regenerated
axons in the SCI group are similar, but less in density
compared with the sham-injured group (Figs. 4 and 5).
4. DISCUSSION
The survival rate of zebrafish following SCI is strongly
influenced by their health status. Zebrafish that have recently
been moved to a new environment are prone to branchial
bleeding and death following SCI. A water temperature below
15C also significantly increases the mortality. The health
status of zebrafish is difficult to be determined when they are
purchased from a supplier. If the mortality reaches over 50%,
we recommend changing to a new batch of fish. After SCI,
anti-fungal agents will partly improve the health of injured fish
which were healthy before SCI, but is of little help with fish
that were unhealthy before SCI. Under optimal conditions, fish
recover well in swimming ability within 6 weeks after SCI. If
fish swim well already within one week after surgery, spinal
cord transection was not complete and such fish should not be
further evaluated. It should be noted that the mortality of
zebrafish after SCI is due largely to the lack of practice.
Initially, a mortality rate of 30%e40% has to be taken into
account, while with practice, the rate should decrease to 20%.
To monitor successful recovery of swim behavior at the
cellular level, there are two ways of tracing: anterograde
tracing and retrograde tracing. In anterograde tracing, biocytin
is applied via gelfoam at the brainstem/spinal cord junction of
fish at defined times after SCI. The gelfoam will not be
absorbed, but the biocytin will be anterogradely transported to
the cell body. Axons descending from brain nuclei, and

anterograde axonal tracing. Biocytin-soaked gelfoam is
applied caudal to the original lesion site. Neurons in the
different brain nuclei that project to the spinal cord lesion site
can then be retrogradely labeled, enabling neural profiles to be
detected in sections of the brain (Becker et al., 1997; Xue

anterograde tracing of regrown axons to evaluate successful
recovery of zebrafish SCI.
To date, in our system, we have not found a difference in
success and survival rates between male and female zebrafish
SCI. So there is no gender preference in this model. Whether
zebrafish can restore their locomotor ability after repetitive
spinal cord injury has yet to be studied.
