Abstract
Adult central nervous system axons show restricted growth and regeneration properties after injury. One of the underlying mecha-
nisms is the activation of the Nogo-A/Nogo receptor (NgR1) signaling pathway. Nogo-A knockout (KO) mice show enhanced
regenerative growth in vivo, even though it is less pronounced than after acute antibody-mediated neutralization of Nogo-A.
Residual inhibition may involve a compensatory component. By mRNA expression profiling and immunoblots we show increased
expression of several members of the Ephrin/Eph and Semaphorin/Plexin families of axon guidance molecules, e.g. EphrinA3
and EphA4, in the intact spinal cord of adult Nogo-A KO vs. wild-type (WT) mice. EphrinA3 inhibits neurite outgrowth of EphA4-
positive neurons in vitro. In addition, EphrinA3 KO myelin extracts are less growth-inhibitory than WT but more than Nogo-A KO
myelin extracts. EphA4 KO cortical neurons show decreased growth inhibition on Nogo-A KO myelin as compared with WT
neurons, supporting increased EphA4-mediated growth inhibition in Nogo-A KO mice. Consistently, in vivo, Nogo-A/EphA4 double
KO mice show increased axonal sprouting and regeneration after spinal cord injury as compared with EphA4 KO mice. Our
results reveal the upregulation of developmental axon guidance cues following constitutive Nogo-A deletion, e.g. the EphrinA3/
EphA4 ligand/receptor pair, and support their role in restricting neurite outgrowth in the absence of Nogo-A.
Introduction
Adult central nervous system (CNS) injuries result in chronic func-
tional impairment as a consequence of the extremely limited ability
of lesioned axons to successfully regrow and repair the damaged
neuronal network (Yiu & He, 2006; Schwab, 2010). CNS regenera-
tion is prevented by various cell-intrinsic suppressors of growth sig-
naling, e.g. phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; Park et al.,
2008), as well as by cell-extrinsic mechanisms (Yiu & He, 2006).
The latter include growth inhibitory factors present in the glial scar,
e.g. chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (Bradbury et al., 2002; Fawc-
ett, 2006), as well as in myelin, e.g. Nogo-A (Chen et al., 2000;
GrandPre et al., 2000; Prinjha et al., 2000), myelin-associated
glycoprotein (MAG; McKerracher et al., 1994; Mukhopadhyay
et al., 1994), oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp; Wang
et al., 2002) or the lipid sulfatide (Winzeler et al., 2011). In the last
decade, several scar- or myelin-associated developmental axon guid-
ance molecules and their receptors have been shown to possess
growth-inhibitory properties – repulsive guidance molecule RGMa
(Hata et al., 2006), EphrinB3 (Benson et al., 2005; Duffy et al.,
2012), EphA4 (Goldshmit et al., 2004, 2011; Fabes et al., 2006),
EphB3 (Liu et al., 2006), Sema3A (Kaneko et al., 2006; Pasterk-
amp & Verhaagen, 2006; Montolio et al., 2009), Sema4D (Moreau-
Fauvarque et al., 2003), Sema5A (Goldberg et al., 2004), Netrin1
(Low et al., 2008) and PlexinA2 (Shim et al., 2012).
Among myelin-associated growth inhibitors, Nogo-A has been
most extensively studied in vitro and in vivo. Neutralization via func-
tion-blocking antibodies led to regenerative growth and enhanced
sprouting and plasticity in rodent and primate models of spinal cord
injury (Zorner & Schwab, 2010), paving the way for clinical trials in
acute spinal cord-injured, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple
sclerosis patients (ClinicalTrials.gov – NCT00406016, NCT00875446
and NCT01424423; Buchli et al., 2007). Similar results were obtained
by blocking the Nogo-A receptor NgR1 (Akbik et al., 2012). Despite
the consistent association of acute Nogo-A or NgR1 blockade with

increased axonal sprouting and regeneration after CNS injury, the gen-
eration of different Nogo-A, Nogo-A/B or Nogo-A/B/C knockout
(KO) mice by several laboratories led to more moderate and contro-
versial phenotypes (Kim et al., 2003; Simonen et al., 2003; Zheng
et al., 2003; Dimou et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2009, 2010; Cafferty
et al., 2010). These were attributed to differences in Nogo deletion
mutants, mouse strain genetic background effects, differences in
experimental protocols, or possible compensation by other Nogo iso-
forms, other reticulon proteins or functionally related genes (Schwab,
2004; Lee & Zheng, 2012; Tews et al., 2013). However, genetic com-
pensation in Nogo-A KO mice as well as its functional implication
with regard to axonal growth and regeneration has not yet been sys-
tematically addressed.
By performing a microarray screen, we investigated the upregula-
tion of potential subsidiary inhibitors in the spinal cord of adult
Nogo-A KO mice. We found an upregulation of several axon guid-
ance molecules, and identified EphrinA3 as a novel neuronal growth
inhibitor signaling via the receptor EphA4. Our results suggest a
role for EphA4 in partially mediating the residual inhibition
observed in Nogo-A KO mice.
Material and methods
Experimental animals
All animal experiments were performed with the approval and in
accordance with the guidelines of the Zurich Cantonal Veterinary
Office. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the Euro-
pean Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/
EEC). All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals
required. Postnatal day 5–8 (P5–8) and adult C57BL/6 male and
female wild-type (WT), Nogo-A KO (Simonen et al., 2003; Dimou
et al., 2006), EphA4 KO (Dottori et al., 1998; Kullander et al.,
2001) and Nogo-A/EphA4 double KO mice were used in this study.
All lines were backcrossed for at least ten generations and maintained
on a pure C57BL/6 background to exclude strain-specific effects.
EphA4 KO mice (Dottori et al., 1998; Kullander et al., 2001) were
kindly provided by R. Klein (Max-Planck Institute for Neurobiology,
Martinsried, Germany). Nogo-A/EphA4 double KO mice were gener-
ated by crossing Nogo-A KO with EphA4 KO mice. EphrinA3 KO
(Cutforth et al., 2003) spinal cord tissue was a generous gift from D.
Feldheim (University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

IgG-Fcc fragment (Cat. No. 109-005-098; Jackson Laboratories).
Affymetrix GeneChips
Lumbar spinal cords from three adult (3–4 months old) male WT
and Nogo-A KO mice were dissected and transferred into ‘RNA
later’ stabilization solution (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Total RNA
extraction, cRNA preparation, array hybridization on GeneChip®
Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays, data acquisition and analysis were
performed as described previously (Craveiro et al., 2008). Data were
analysed applying a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; P < 0.05).
A final threshold of ≥ 1.2-fold increase or decrease in the expression
level of each single transcript was applied. Regulated transcripts were
assigned to functional categories according to GeneOntology (http://
www.geneontology.org) as well as literature and database mining
(PubMed: http://www.pubmed.com; Bioinformatics Harvester EMBL
Heidelberg: http://harvester.kit.edu/HarvesterPortal). GeneChip data
are available online at the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=jlcnjkwuyccocxk&acc=GSE11276).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Primer and probe sets were designed through Primer Express Soft-
ware version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total
RNA from three Nogo-A KO and three WT adult (4 months old)
lumbar spinal cords was transcribed to cDNA using the TaqMan
Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan
qRT-PCR was performed. Target amplification with TaqMan Univer-
sal PCR Master Mix for three replicates per sample was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Signal was detected with
the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (software version
1.6). Relative quantification was performed using the comparative CT
method (Muller et al., 2002). The 18S ribosomal subunit was used
as an endogenous reference control. The following primers were

Rev 5′-GACCGGCTTCTCCCCG-3′); EphA4 (Fwd 5′-GGCTCCTT
GGATGCTTTCC-3′, Rev 5′-GCATGCCCACCAGCTGA-3′); Sema-
phorin3F (Sema3F, Fwd 5′-CATCAACCGAGAGCCCCTTA-3′,
Rev 5′-ATGCACTCCTCAATGCGCT-3′); Semaphorin4D (Sema4D,

CCAGT-3′, Rev 5′-GAGCCGCATGGGAAGC-3′); and 18S RNA
(Fwd 5′-CTTTGGTCGCTCGCTCCTC-3′, Rev 5′-CTGACCGGGTT
GGTTTTGAT-3′).
To determine changes in EphrinA3 and GFAP expression 7 days
after spinal cord injury (see below), a dissected spinal cord segment
spanning the lesion site (5 mm) was dissected from four WT mice.
Sham-operated mice were used as control (n = 4). Total RNA and
cDNA was processed as described above. cDNA was amplified using
the Light Cycler 480 thermocycler (Roche Diagnostics AG, Rotkreuz,
Switzerland) with the polymerase ready mix (SYBR Green I Master;
Roche Diagnostics AG). Relative quantification was performed using
the comparative CT method. cDNA levels were normalized to the re-
ference gene Gapdh (Fwd 5′-CAGCAATGCATCCTGCACC-3′, Rev
5′-TGGACTGTGGTCATGAGCCC-3′). The following primers were
used for GFAP (Fwd 5′-CCAC CAAACTGGCTGATGTCTAC-3′,
Rev 5′- TTCTCTCCAAATCCA CACGAGC -3′). Each reaction was
done in triplicate.
Immunoblotting
Tissues were homogenized and proteins extracted on ice in lysis
buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% 3-[(3-cholam-
idopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), protease
inhibitors cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)) and processed as
previously described (Montani et al., 2009). Twenty or 40 lg pro-
tein was loaded per lane. Densitometry analysis was performed with
IMAGEJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Values were norma-
lized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH and to the mean value of
the corresponding control group.
Cell culture
Dissociated cortical neurons
Cortices from P5–P8 mice were rapidly dissected in ice-cold Hiber-
nate A medium (BrainBits, Springfield, IL, USA) supplemented with
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2% B27
supplement (Gibco) and 200 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), and digested
for 35 min at 30 °C with 2 mg/mL papain (Worthington, Lakewood,
NJ, USA). After gentle trituration with a flame-polished Pasteur
pipette, cortical neurons were purified from oligodendrocytes and
microglial cells on an OptiPrep (Greiner, Monroe, NC, USA) density
gradient. Cells were plated at 15 000 cells/cm2 on glass coverslips
coated with 1 lg/mL poly-L-ornithine (poly(O); Sigma, St Louis,
MO, USA). Cultures were grown for 48 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 in Neu-
robasal A medium (Gibco) supplemented with 1% penicillin/strepto-
mycin (Gibco), 2% B27 (Gibco) and 200 mM L-glutamine (Gibco).
Dissociated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons
DRG were removed from P5–P8 mice and processed as previously
described (Montani et al., 2009). DRG neurons were cultured at a
density of 4500 cells/cm2 for 10 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 on glass cover-
slips coated with 20 lg/mL poly-L-lysine (PLL; Sigma) and
5 lg/mL laminin (Invitrogen).
Neurite outgrowth assays
For assays involving recombinant Fc chimeric proteins, EphrinA3-Fc
was clustered with goat anti-human IgG-Fcc in a ratio of 1 : 10 for
2 h at 37 °C. Glass coverslips were coated with poly(O) or PLL/lami-
nin (see above) and overlaid with 50 nM clustered EphrinA3-Fc or
control Fc in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.4) for 2 h
at 37 °C before plating of the cells. For outgrowth assays on myelin-
enriched spinal cord lysates, membrane-enriched spinal cord extracts
were prepared. Dissected spinal cords were homogenized and pro-
teins extracted on ice in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
60 mM CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini; Roche)). Lysates
were enriched in membrane proteins by centrifugation for 1 h at
100 000 g at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Glass co-
verslips were coated with poly(O) and 6 lg/cm2 spinal cord extracts
for 2 h at 37 °C before plating of the cells.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained
for bIII-Tubulin as previously described (Joset et al., 2010). Cul-
tures were imaged with a DFC 350 FX Leica camera in a Leica
DM 5500 B microscope equipped with a 10 9 objective (HCX PL
FLUOTAR, NA 0.3). Neurite outgrowth was quantified using Meta-
Morph software (Visitron systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany).
Spinal cord injury and corticospinal tract (CST) tracing
Twenty-week-old C57BL/6 WT (n = 11), Nogo-A KO (n = 12),
EphA4 KO (n = 13) and Nogo-A/EphA4 double KO (n = 11) mice
of either sex were deeply anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection
of Hypnorm (0.3 mg/kg body weight; Jansen Pharmaceuticals,
Titusville, NJ, USA)/Dormicum (0.6 mg/kg body weight; Roche). A
laminectomy was performed at thoracic level 8 (T8). The dura was
opened and a bilateral lesion of the dorsal and the dorsolateral funi-
culi and the dorsal horns was produced with iridectomy scissors
under a surgical microscope. Subsequently, back muscles were
sutured and the skin was closed with surgical staples. For antero-
grade tracing of the CST, mice received four injections (0.5 lL
each) of a 10% biotin dextran amine (BDA; 10 000 mol. wt; Invi-
trogen) solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.2) into the
right sensory-motor cortex immediately after spinal cord injury. Ani-
mals were killed 24 days post-injury. To determine changes in Eph-
rinA3 expression after spinal cord injury, four WT mice underwent
a dorsal hemisection surgery. Four sham-operated WT mice were
used as control. Tissue was dissected 7 days post-injury and pro-
cessed as described above.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue preparation
Animals were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal,
75 mg/100 g body weight; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL,
USA) and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA
containing 5% sucrose. Spinal cords were dissected and postfixed in
the same fixative overnight at 4 °C before they were cryoprotected
in 30% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura
Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan) and rapidly frozen in isopentane at
40 °C.
Immunofluorescence staining
Forty lm-thick cross or longitudinal sections were cut on a cryostat
and transferred to ice-cold PBS for free-floating immunostaining.

Genetic compensation in the CNS of Nogo-A KO mice 3569
Free aldehyde groups were quenched in antigen retrieval solution
(0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM glycine) for 3 min at 80 °C. After per-
meabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 20 min, sections were
blocked with 4% goat serum in 0.1 M PB for 1 h. Primary antibod-
ies were applied overnight at 4 °C. After washing, sections were
incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 h at room
temperature. Sections were then counterstained with Hoechst dye
33342 (Invitrogen), mounted on Superfrost-Plus slides (Menzel-
Gl€aser, Braunschweig, Germany) and coverslipped with Mowiol/2%
DABCO (Sigma). Images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera
(CoolSNAP HQ, Photometrics) on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and
collected using image analysis software MCID ELITE Software version
7.0 (Imaging Research). A 5 9 objective (Plan NEOFLUAR, NA
0.15) was used. Single-cell densitometry analysis was performed
using the IMAGEJ software (NIH; Version 1.44). The same exposure
time was used for all images of a given staining. Ten images were
taken from a region of interest and averaged for each animal. Mean
gray level values were background-corrected and normalized to the
mean value of the corresponding control group. Confocal images
were acquired by using a TCS SP2 AOBS spectral confocal micro-
scope (Leica Microsystems) with a 20 9 (HC PL FLUOTAR, NA
0.50) or 63 9 oil immersion objective (HCX PL APO Oil, NA
1.32).
Peroxidase diaminobenzidine staining
Thirty lm-thick sagittal sections comprising the lesion site and
~15 mm of the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site were cut on a
cryostat. The medulla oblongata was cut in the transverse plane to
control for labeling efficiency. Sections were stained for BDA
according to the nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine (DAB) protocol
as described previously (Herzog and Brosamle, 1997). Subsequently,
sections were dehydrated and coverslipped with Eukitt (Kindler,
Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany).
Quantification of regenerative properties of the CST
Animals showing a smaller or bigger (almost complete transection)
lesion of the CST were excluded from the study (WT: n = 1, EphA4
KO: n = 2, Nogo-A/EphA4 KO: n = 2). The number of CST sprout-
ing fibers 1 mm rostral to the lesion site was assessed using a 0–3
point scoring scale (0, no sprouting; 1, single and short fine fibers; 2,
longer fibers, rarely reaching the lesion center and rarely having
growth cones; 3, dense outgrowth of fibers from the main CST
toward and around the lesion, frequent growth cones) as previously
described (Liebscher et al., 2005; Dimou et al., 2006). The number
of labeled axons caudal to the lesion site was quantified on all adja-
cent sagittal sections of the traced half of the spinal cord using dorso-
ventral lines positioned at the lesion center and at 1, 3, 5 and 10 mm
caudal to the lesion as described previously (Liebscher et al., 2005;
Dimou et al., 2006). BDA tracing efficiency, expressed as the ave-
rage number of BDA-positive CST axons in the medullary pyramids,
was comparable between the genotypes (WT: 2126.38  72.00,
Nogo-A KO: 1958.06  52.75, EphA4 KO: 1995.33  47.22,
Nogo-A/EphA4 KO: 2013.19  78.16; F3,38 = 2.542, P > 0.05;
one-way ANOVA). Thus, the obtained sum of fibers at each distance
quantified was expressed as the raw number of axons per section.
Quantification of the lesion and scar volume
To visualize the lesion and the scar volume, all sagittal sections of
each animal were immunostained with an anti-GFAP antibody.
Lesion area was defined as the GFAP-negative area of the lesion
core, whereas the scar area was defined as the GFAP-positive region
surrounding the lesion core. Sections were reconstructed using a
Neurolucida software-controlled computer system (MBF Bioscience,
Williston, VT, USA) to estimate the lesion and scar volume. Images
were taken under a Leica DM 5500 B microscope equipped with a
10 9 objective (HCX PL FLUOTAR, NA 0.3).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical software
SPSS (IBM) and GRAPHPAD PRISM (GraphPad Software Inc., La
Jolla, CA, USA). For quantification of neurite outgrowth, the
mean  SEM of neurite length for each condition (150–200 cells)
was determined from multiple independent experiments. For quanti-
fication of immunoblots, the mean  SEM of normalized densi-
tometry values for each condition was determined from 3–4 mice.
For quantification of immunohistochemistry, the mean  SEM of
normalized densitometry values for each condition (ten cells) was
determined from three mice. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemi-
cal, neurite outgrowth and qRT-PCR data were analysed using an
unpaired Student’s t test (two-tailed). For quantification of regene-
rative growth, the number of BDA-positive axons at specified
distances was counted as described above. The mean  SEM of
CST axons per section was determined from 9–12 mice and
subjected to a Welch’s t test to account for unequal variances and
non-normal distributions. The mean  SEM of sprouting fibers
1 mm rostral to the lesion site was determined from 9–12 mice
and was analysed by a Welch’s t test. The mean  SEM of the
lesion and scar volume was determined from 5–10 mice and sub-
jected to a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Bonferroni’s
test; n identifies the number of independent experiments or mice.
A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
All data are shown as mean values  SEM with *P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
Results
Upregulation of developmental axon guidance molecules in
the spinal cord of adult Nogo-A KO mice
To investigate compensatory changes due to the constitutive genetic
ablation of Nogo-A, we compared the transcriptome of the intact lum-
bar spinal cord of adult C57BL/6 Nogo-A KO vs. WT mice. The
Affymetrix GeneChip analysis revealed the statistically significant
regulation of 606 transcripts above or below a 1.2-fold change thresh-
old (P < 0.05; ANOVA). In total, 554 (91.4%) genes showed an
increased expression, and 52 (8.6%) a decreased expression. The
main represented functional categories, with assignments based on
GeneOntology and literature mining, were – signaling (14%), tran-
scription and RNA processing (13%), transport (9%), cell growth
(9%), metabolism (7%), protein processing (6.5%), synapse related
and vesicles (5.5%), axon guidance and cell adhesion (5%), DNA
and chromatin processing (4.5%), proteolysis and peptidolysis (4%),
defense/immune response (4%), cytoskeleton (3%), apoptosis (3%)
and response to stress (1%; Fig. 1A, Supporting Information Table S1).
In accordance with our previously published data showing a role for
neuronal Nogo-A in remodeling of the growth cone cytoskeleton in
the intact CNS (Montani et al., 2009), we observed the upregulation

(1.51-fold)) (Table S1).
To address a possible upregulation of growth-inhibitory molecules
in Nogo-A KO mice, we focused on changes in the expression of
the known myelin-associated growth inhibitors as well as on devel-
opmental repulsive/inhibitory axon guidance molecules. Analysis of
the growth-inhibitory myelin proteins MAG and OMgp revealed a
1.46-fold upregulation of MAG mRNA, whereas no change was
observed for OMgp (Table S1). Interestingly, specific members
of the Sema/Plexin and Ephrin/Eph families of axon guidance
molecules responded to the ablation of Nogo-A: the mRNA levels
of Sema4D, Sema3F and the Sema receptor PlexinB2 were
significantly upregulated by 1.31-, 1.63- and 1.50-fold, respectively
(Fig. 1A). Among Ephrin/Eph members, EphrinA3 mRNA was
found to be 1.56-fold enriched, whereas the change for EphA4 was
below 1.2-fold (1.18) albeit significant (Fig. 1A). All observed tran-
scriptional changes in Ephrin/Eph and Sema/Plexin family members
were further verified by qRT-PCR. We confirmed significant
changes for EphrinA3, Sema3F and Sema4D, and additionally
showed a significant 1.36-fold upregulation of EphA4 (Fig. 1A),
whose role in inhibiting CNS regeneration has been the object of
recent studies (Goldshmit et al., 2004, 2011; Cruz-Orengo et al.,
2006, 2007; Fabes et al., 2006, 2007; Herrmann et al., 2010b;
Munro et al., 2012).

Genetic compensation in the CNS of Nogo-A KO mice 3571
EphrinA3 is upregulated in spinal cord oligodendrocytes and
neurons of adult Nogo-A KO mice
We hypothesized that MAG as well as the guidance cues EphrinA3,
EphA4, Sema3F and Sema4D might compensate for the lack of
Nogo-A in Nogo-A KO mice. Their upregulation was therefore fur-
ther investigated at the protein level by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B).
MAG protein levels did not change significantly in Nogo-A KO
spinal cord lysates (WT: 100.0  4.5%, KO: 114.6  7.6%;
P = 0.150, n = 4; unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test). However,
we found that EphrinA3 (t6 = 4.948, P = 0.003, n = 4), EphA4
(t6 = 4.613, P = 0.004, n = 4), Sema3F (t4 = 4.305, P = 0.013,
n = 3) and Sema4D (t6 = 8.180, P < 0.0001, n = 4) were signifi-
cantly upregulated in Nogo-A KO spinal cord lysates (unpaired two-
tailed Student’s t test; Fig. 1B). The large fold change in EphrinA3
mRNA and protein (WT: 100.0  9.1%, KO: 179.5  13.3%,
n = 4) expression as well as its unknown role for growth inhibition
in the adult CNS prompted us to select EphrinA3 for further analy-
sis. EphrinA3 can bind to several Ephrin receptors. Interestingly, a
number of signaling components known to be modulated by the
EphrinA3/EphA4 axis were also increased in the Nogo-A KO spinal
cord, e.g. the Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) regulators
p35-Cdk5, Cables1 and Fnbp2/Cdkrap2 (Table S1). Together, these
data point to a potential upregulation of EphrinA3/EphA4 signaling
following constitutive genetic deletion of Nogo-A in vivo.
Sema4D, Sema3F and EphA4 have been reported to be upregu-
lated following spinal cord injury and thereby to increase growth
inhibition (Moreau-Fauvarque et al., 2003; Goldshmit et al., 2004;
Lindholm et al., 2004; Fabes et al., 2006). To investigate changes
in EphrinA3 expression 7 days post-injury, a semi-quantitative
RT-PCR analysis of EphrinA3 in lesioned spinal cord tissue
including the lesion site was performed. As opposed to GFAP
(t6 = 6.399, P < 0.001, n = 4), denoting reactive astrogliosis fol-
lowing injury (Fawcett, 2006), EphrinA3 mRNA levels did not
significantly change when compared with sham-operated WT mice
(Fig. 1C).
The cell type-specific localization of EphrinA3 in the adult
spinal cord has not yet been addressed. Immunohistochemical
analysis of EphrinA3 in the spinal cord of adult WT and Nogo-
A KO mice revealed its expression in NeuN-positive neurons
(Fig. 2A–C) but not in GFAP-positive astrocytes (Fig. 2D–F).
Double immunostaining with the oligodendrocyte marker receptor-
interacting protein (RIP) showed that EphrinA3 is also expressed
in oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2G and H). Single-cell densitometric
quantification of EphrinA3 expression in the lumbar spinal cord
at level L4–L6 (Fig. 2I) revealed its significant upregulation in
both neurons and oligodendrocytes of Nogo-A KO mice (Fig. 2J).
The upregulation of EphrinA3 in the gray matter was reflected by
a marked increase in the analysed Rexed’s laminae I–III (~54%;
t4 = 3.479, P = 0.025, n = 3), IV (~46%; t4 = 4.513, P = 0.011,
n = 3), VII (~56%; t4 = 2.711, P = 0.054, n = 3) and IX (~71%;
t4 = 3.308, P = 0.030, n = 3; unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test;
Fig. 2J). In the white matter, EphrinA3 immunoreactivity in oligo-
dendrocytes was increased by ~120% (t4 = 4.193, P = 0.014,
n = 3) and ~97% (t4 = 4.501, P = 0.011, n = 3) in the dorsal
and ventral funiculus, respectively (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t
test; Fig. 2J). The predominant upregulation of EphrinA3 in mye-
linating oligodendrocytes, coupled to the known axonal expression
of EphA4 (Kullander et al., 2001; Leighton et al., 2001), sug-
gested that myelin-associated EphrinA3 might restrict axonal
growth and regeneration via EphA4 in the spinal cord of Nogo-A
KO mice.
EphrinA3 inhibits neurite outgrowth via EphA4 in vitro
We investigated the growth-inhibitory properties of EphrinA3 by
analysing the outgrowth of two neuronal cell types plated on a
clustered EphrinA3-Fc substrate. P5–P8 WT cortical neurons, which
endogenously express the EphA4 receptor (Fig. 3A; Benson et al.,
2005), were significantly inhibited by EphrinA3-Fc when compared
with the Fc control (t10 = 6.606, P < 0.001, n = 6; unpaired two-
tailed Student’s t test; Fig. 3B and C). By contrast, P5–P8 DRG
neurons, which do not express detectable levels of EphA4, were
not significantly inhibited by EphrinA3-Fc (P = 0.465, n = 3;
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test; Fig. 3A, D and E). To confirm
the role of EphA4 for EphrinA3-mediated growth inhibition, corti-
cal neurons were isolated from EphA4 KO mice and plated on
clustered EphrinA3-Fc. Notably, EphA4 KO cortical neurons were
not inhibited by EphrinA3-Fc when compared with control Fc
(P = 0.602, n = 6; unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test; Fig. 3B
and C), showing that EphA4 mediates EphrinA3-induced growth
inhibition.
We then addressed the inhibitory properties of membrane-
enriched EphrinA3 KO spinal cord extracts on neurite outgrowth of
cortical neurons. When compared with extracts prepared from WT
and Nogo-A KO mice, we found that EphrinA3 KO extracts were
significantly less inhibitory than WT (t12 = 3.046, P = 0.011, n = 7;
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test) but more than Nogo-A KO
extracts (t12 = 2.234, P = 0.047, n = 7; unpaired two-tailed
Student’s t test; Fig. 3F and G). Finally, we investigated whether
EphA4 KO cortical neurons grown on Nogo-A KO spinal cord
extracts would show a decreased inhibition as compared with WT
neurons. Indeed, EphA4 KO cortical neurons were significantly less
inhibited by Nogo-A KO spinal cord extracts than WT neurons
(t14 = 2.462, P = 0.026, n = 7; unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test;
Fig. 3H and I). These results support a functional role for the broad-
range Ephrin receptor EphA4 in mediating increased growth inhibi-
tion following constitutive Nogo-A ablation.
CST regeneration after spinal cord injury in WT, Nogo-A KO,
EphA4 KO and Nogo-A/EphA4 double KO mice
Given the increased EphA4-mediated growth inhibition in Nogo-A
KO mice, we reasoned that the combined deletion of Nogo-A and
EphA4 may have an additive or synergistic effect on axonal rege-
neration. This was addressed by analysing axonal sprouting and
regeneration following spinal cord injury in newly generated Nogo-
A/EphA4 double KO mice. As described for EphA4 KO mice, also
Nogo-A/EphA4 KO mice showed a majority of normally positioned
CST axons within the dorsal funiculus but these axons had aberrant
projections across the midline forming bilateral connections (Dottori
et al., 1998; Coonan et al., 2001; Kullander et al., 2001; Leighton
et al., 2001). In addition, Nogo-A/EphA4 KO mice showed a ven-
tral displacement of the mature CST termination pattern reaching
the intermediate zone of the spinal cord as described for EphA4 KO
alone (Coonan et al., 2001). Thus, the aberrant CST projections pre-
cluded a reliable comparison between EphA4-positive and -negative
genotypes, especially in the zone of regenerative sprouting at the
lesion site (surviving displaced CST axon branches could not be dis-
tinguished from sprouting fibers in the tissue bridge ventral to the
lesion) and in the caudal spinal cord. Therefore, WT mice were
compared with Nogo-A KO mice, and EphA4 KOs with Nogo-A/
EphA4 KOs. Similar to EphA4 KO mice (Herrmann et al., 2010b),
Nogo-A/EphA4 double KO mice also showed pronounced balance
problems manifested as lateral recumbency after spinal cord injury,

which made many behavioral tests difficult or impossible to per-
form.
In 20-weeks-old WT, Nogo-A KO, EphA4 KO and Nogo-A/
EphA4 double KO mice, the dorsal half of the spinal cord, including
the main CST and its minor components in the dorso-lateral funiculi,
was transected bilaterally. The volume of the GFAP-negative lesion
core was measured. No significant differences could be observed
among the mice of different genotypes (WT: 0.067  0.004 mm3
(n = 6), Nogo-A KO: 0.055  0.006 mm3 (n = 10), EphA4 KO:
0.059  0.006 mm3 (n = 7), Nogo-A/EphA4 KO: 0.065 
0.004 mm3 (n = 5); F3,24 = 1.007, P = 0.406; one-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni’s post hoc test) (Fig. 4A and B). In accordance with a
previous study (Goldshmit et al., 2004), the astrocytic scar volume,
defined as GFAP-positive tissue volume surrounding the lesion core,
was significantly smaller in EphA4 KO (P < 0.01) and Nogo-A/
EphA4 double KO (P < 0.05), but not in Nogo-A KO mice
when compared with WT mice (WT: 0.528  0.059 mm3 (n = 6),
Nogo-A KO: 0.413  0.061 mm3 (n = 10), EphA4 KO:

mm3 (n = 5)) (F3,24 = 7.245, P = 0.001; one-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni’s post hoc test; Fig. 4A and C).
Sprouting of CST axons 1 mm rostral to the lesion was assessed
using a 0–3 point scoring scale. As previously described by Dimou
et al. (2006), sprouting was moderate in WTs and significantly
increased in Nogo-A KO mice (WT: 1.24  0.18 n = 10, Nogo-A
KO: 1.86  0.21 n = 12; t13 = 2.604, P = 0.03; Welch’s t test;
Fig. 5A, A′, B and B′). In EphA4 KO and Nogo-A/EphA4 KO
mice, sprouting was further increased but comparable between the
genotypes (EphA4 KO: 2.20  0.24, n = 11; Nogo-A/EphA4 KO:
2.33  0.19, n = 9; t11 = 0.847, P = 0.69; Welch’s t test; Fig. 5C,
C′, D and D′). Many of these fibers extended laterally and ventrally
from the main CST into the adjacent gray and white matter and
below the lesion (Fig. 5A′–D′; arrows). In both EphA4 KO and
Nogo-A/EphA4 double KO mice, many sprouts ended very close to
or in the lesion itself (Fig. 5C′ and D′; arrowheads). Due to the
aberrant ventral course of some CST fibers in the EphA4 KO spinal
cord, an unknown proportion of the fibers curving around the lesion
in the ventral tissue bridge in EphA4 KO and Nogo-A/EphA4 KOs
may be intact spared CST fibers in addition to regenerating and
sprouting fibers (Fig. 5E ‘lesion site’). Nevertheless, the number of
fibers that bypassed the lesion on the ventral tissue bridges was lar-
ger in Nogo-A KO and Nogo-A/EphA4 KO mice than in the respec-
tive controls. CST axons that were present in the spinal cord caudal
to the lesion were quantified at 1, 3, 5 and 10 mm past the lesion
(Dimou et al., 2006). An irregular, tortuous and often branched
growth pattern of thin fibers typical of regenerative growth was
observed (Simonen et al., 2003; Liebscher et al., 2005; Fig. 5A″–D″).
As previously described, Nogo-A KO mice showed a significant
increase in the number of regenerating fibers at 1, 3 and 5 mm past
the lesion when compared with WT mice (Fig. 5E; Simonen et al.,
2003; Dimou et al., 2006). EphA4 KO mice displayed more fibers
than WT and Nogo-A KO mice up to 10 mm caudal to the lesion,
even though these fibers probably represent a mixture of regenerated
axons and branches/sprouts of spared axons (see above; Fig. 5E).
These results support previous evidence for a role of EphA4 in
restricting axonal regeneration in the adult CNS (Goldshmit et al.,
2004, 2011) and suggest that Nogo-A and EphA4 may additively
restrict axonal sprouting and regeneration in the adult CNS.
Discussion
We performed mRNA expression profiling of the intact spinal cord
of adult constitutive C57BL/6 Nogo-A KO (Simonen et al., 2003;
Dimou et al., 2006) vs. WT mice to identify compensatory altera-
tions that may account for residual growth inhibition in the absence
of Nogo-A. Our study shows that the repulsive axon guidance mole-
cules Sema4D, Sema3F, EphrinA3 and EphA4 are upregulated in
the adult spinal cord of Nogo-A KO mice at transcript and protein
level. We identify EphrinA3 as a novel, myelin-associated inhibitor
of neurite outgrowth in the adult CNS and we find EphA4-mediated
growth inhibition upregulated in Nogo-A KO mice. In vivo, we con-
firm a role for EphA4 in restricting axonal regeneration in the adult
CNS and show that combined deletion of Nogo-A and EphA4
results in increased regenerative growth after spinal cord injury
when compared with EphA4 KO mice.
EphrinA3 has been known mainly for its role in synaptic remod-
eling and plasticity in the hippocampus (Pasquale, 2005). Here we
show that EphrinA3 is also expressed in adult white matter oligo-
dendrocytes and inhibits neurite outgrowth of primary neurons in an
EphA4-dependent manner in vitro. The upregulation of three major

Cdk5 regulators (p35-Cdk5, Cables1 and Fnbp2/Cdkrap2), previ-
ously implicated in dendritic spine retraction upon EphrinA3-
induced activation of EphA4 in the hippocampus (Zukerberg et al.,
2000; Fu et al., 2007), suggests that Cdk5 might be a key down-
stream mediator of the EphrinA3/EphA4 inhibitory pathway. Further
studies will be needed to further address the role of Cdk5 in neurite
outgrowth inhibition. A chemorepellent function has also been pre-
viously attributed to Sema3F and Sema4D in the injured CNS and
scar tissue (Pasterkamp & Verhaagen, 2006). Sema4D is expressed
in oligodendrocytes, upregulated after CNS injury, and inhibits the
growth of postnatal sensory and cerebellar granule cell neurons
in vitro (Moreau-Fauvarque et al., 2003). Sema3F is secreted into
the glial-fibrotic scar by meningeal fibroblasts (Pasterkamp et al.,
1999; De Winter et al., 2002), upregulated after intraspinal moto-
neuron axotomy (Lindholm et al., 2004) and induces growth cone
collapse in vitro (Atwal et al., 2003). Together, these changes indi-
cate that Sema4D, Sema3F and EphrinA3 may also impact the
regenerative response observed in Nogo-A KO mice. Their relative
functional contributions remain to be determined. It would be of
particular interest to know whether similar compensatory changes
also occur in other targeted and gene trap Nogo mutants and how
closely they are associated with the observed, line-specific regenera-
tive phenotypes. Variations in the degree of upregulation of com-
pensatory mechanisms could play an important role for the observed
differential growth and regeneration capacity in the different
Nogo-A, Nogo-A/B and Nogo-A/B/C KO lines (Kim et al., 2003;
Simonen et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2003; Cafferty & Strittmatter,
2006; Dimou et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2009).
Our results point to a functional role for the broad-range Ephrin
receptor EphA4 in mediating growth-restricting signals in Nogo-A
KO mice. By using a dorsal bilateral hemisection spinal cord injury
model, we specifically assessed a potential additive or synergistic
role of Nogo-A and of EphA4 in axonal regeneration. It is of note
that signaling pathways induced by Nogo-A and EphA4 converge

Genetic compensation in the CNS of Nogo-A KO mice 3575
towards the activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which is central
to growth repulsion and inhibition of axonal regeneration (Pasquale,
2005; Schwab, 2010). In line with previous studies (Goldshmit
et al., 2004; Dimou et al., 2006), we observed a significantly larger
number of sprouting and regenerating fibers in single Nogo-A KO
and EphA4 KO mice rostral and caudal to the lesion site, respec-
tively, which was augmented in Nogo-A/EphA4 double KO mice.
These results suggest an additive role for Nogo-A and EphA4 in
restricting axonal regeneration post-injury. However, despite strict
quantification criteria, it is possible that an unknown proportion of

ing and reduced CST retraction from the lesion site in mutant mice. Numerous sprouting fibers extended laterally and ventrally from the main CST into the
adjacent gray and white matter (arrows). In EphA4 KO mice, fiber sprouts ended very close to the lesion edge (arrowheads). High-magnification views caudal
to the injury (A″–D″) and corresponding to the marked regions in A–D illustrate regenerating CST fibers extending past the lesion site. (E) Quantification of
the number of BDA-labeled CST axons in the lesion center and at 1, 3, 5 and 10 mm caudal to the lesion. Nogo-A KO mice exhibited significantly more CST
axons at the lesion site and up to 10 mm caudal to the lesion site. Regenerative sprouting and long-distance regeneration is significantly increased in Nogo-A/
EphA4 DOKO compared with single EphA4 KO mice. CST axon guidance defects in EphA4 KO and Nogo-A/EphA4 DOKO mice, which include an increased
number of ventrally misplaced fibers, precluded a reliable direct statistical comparison between EphA4-negative genotypes and WT or Nogo-A KO mice. Data

ventrally misplaced CST axons, inappropriately terminating within
the intermediate zone of the spinal cord, escaped the lesion in
EphA4 KO and Nogo-A/EphA4 KO mice. Fibers caudal to the
lesion might thus be a mixture of regenerating and spared, sprouting
fibers in these mutants. For this reason, cross-comparisons of EphA4
KO and Nogo-A/EphA4 KO mice with WT or Nogo-A single KO
mice could not be made and were not included in the analysis.
Importantly, these fibers do not arise from a different neuronal sub-
population but their misplacement is rather due to an axonal guid-
ance defect of the developing CST (Coonan et al., 2001). Further
studies using inducible conditional EphA4 KO mice without major
developmental defects will allow further clarifying the functional
role of EphA4 in axonal regeneration (Herrmann et al., 2010a).
EphA4 is expressed in astrocytes and neurons (including CST
axons) of the adult spinal cord (Kullander et al., 2001; Leighton
et al., 2001; Goldshmit et al., 2004; Herrmann et al., 2010b) and is
upregulated after spinal cord injury (Goldshmit et al., 2004; Fabes
et al., 2006). Previous studies showed that genetic deletion or func-
tional blockade of EphA4 using soluble ligands or receptors resulted
in enhanced axonal sprouting and in a variable degree of regenera-
tion and functional recovery 6 weeks after a spinal cord lesion in
vivo (Goldshmit et al., 2004, 2011; Cruz-Orengo et al., 2007; Fabes
et al., 2007). The mechanisms by which EphA4 modulates axonal
regeneration are probably complex given its ligand-binding promis-
cuity, its expression pattern and the occurrence of Ephrin/Eph bidi-
rectional signaling (Klein, 2009). EphA4 binds multiple EphrinA
and EphrinB ligand subtypes, thereby enabling a variety of molecu-
lar and intercellular interactions (Pasquale, 2005). Activation of axo-
nal EphA4 by Ephrin ligands expressed on astrocytes and/or on
myelin such as EphrinB2 and EphrinB3 has been proposed to result
in growth cone collapse via the Ephexin1/RhoA pathway (Shamah
et al., 2001; Bundesen et al., 2003; Benson et al., 2005; Sahin
et al., 2005). In vivo, genetic deletion of EphrinB3 resulted in
increased axonal regeneration and functional recovery after a dorsal
hemisection spinal cord lesion, suggesting that EphrinB3 also con-
tributes to the myelin-dependent inhibition of axonal regeneration
(Duffy et al., 2012). In addition, Ephrins expressed in axonal
growth cones may also induce growth cone collapse upon contact
with astrocytic EphA4 via reverse signaling (Goldshmit et al.,
2004). A different mechanism may also be the modulation of the
neuroinflammatory response in EphA4 KO mice after spinal cord
injury (Munro et al., 2012).
Goldshmit et al. (2004) reported decreased astrocyte reactivity in
the scar area as an additional mechanism that could positively influ-
ence regenerative fiber growth in EphA4 KO mice as opposed to a
similar study by Herrmann et al. (2010b). We obtained similar
results to those of Goldshmit et al. (2004) in our EphA4 KO and
Nogo-A/EphA4 double KO mice, indicating that increased regenera-
tion at the lesion site might rely on a reduction in astrocytic gliosis
as well as on reduced levels of and decreased axonal sensitivity to
myelin-associated inhibitors. In Nogo-A KO mice, astrocytic gliosis
was not affected, suggesting that the increased number of CST fibers
caudal to the lesion site are most likely the result of a reduced mye-
lin-mediated growth inhibition by genetic removal of Nogo-A.
In summary, our results show the upregulation of several known
repellent axon guidance family members and of their receptors in the
adult CNS of Nogo-A KO mice. In the injured spinal cord, these mo-
lecules, e.g. EphrinA3/EphA4, impede axonal regeneration and their
upregulation may partially account for the retained inhibitory proper-
ties observed in Nogo-A KO mice. Their modulation was detectable
in the intact adult spinal cord, further suggesting that these upregula-
ted repulsive cues may not only counteract regeneration following a
lesion, but also contribute to the growth- and plasticity-restricting, cir-
cuit-stabilizing function attributed to Nogo-A in the adult CNS
(Schwab, 2010; Akbik et al., 2012). Further studies will be key to
further clarify their specific role in this context.
