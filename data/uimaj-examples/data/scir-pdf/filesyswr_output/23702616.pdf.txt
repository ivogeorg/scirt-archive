Abstract Tissue engineered scaffolds and matrices have
been investigated over the past decade for their potential in
spinal cord repair. They provide a 3-D substrate that can be
permissive for nerve regeneration yet have other roles
including neuroprotection, altering the inflammatory cas-
cade and mechanically stabilizing spinal cord tissue after
injury. In this study we investigated very small lesions
(approx. 0.25 lL in volume) of the dorsal column into
which a phase-separated poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacry-
late) hydrogel scaffold is implanted. Using fluorescent
immunohistochemistry to quantify glial scarring, the
poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) scaffold group showed
reduced intensity compared to lesion controls for GFAP
and the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan neurocan after
6 days. However, the scaffold and tissue was also pushed
dorsally after 6 days while the scaffold was not integrated
into the spinal cord after 28 days. Overall, this small-lesion
spinal cord injury model provided information on the host
tissue reaction of a TE scaffold while reducing animal
discomfort and care.
1 Introduction
The loss of function after spinal cord injury (SCI) is due to the
destructive consequences of the primary injury combined
with the subsequent cascade of pathophysiological events,
termed secondary degeneration, which includes complex
inflammatory events [1, 2]. Due to the complexity of the
pathophysiological events and the variety of types of injury
(e.g. compression/contusion, laceration and transection),
many conceptual different treatment strategies have been
investigated, including drug-, cell- and biomaterial-based
strategies [3–5]. Depending on the treatment strategy, vari-
ous SCI models have been used, including contusion-type
injury models such as the New York University weight-drop
device [6–8], the infinite horizon impactor [9] and the elec-
tromagnetic spinal cord injury device (ESCID) [10], as well
as balloon [11] and clip compression models [12]. These
models are associated with a significant and measured loss of
function [6–8, 13]. This loss in locomotor function can
determine the effectiveness of a therapy to some extent, but
requires labor and cost intensive animal care.
Biomaterial-based treatment strategies most commonly
investigate experimental animal models in which part of
the spinal cord is resected to have physical space to
transplant scaffolds/hydrogels. Many different matrices
and tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds have been implanted
including hydrogels such as fibronectin [14, 15], fibrin
[16], pHEMA [17–19], or agarose [20, 21]. Such in vivo
studies of TE scaffolds/matrices focus mainly on their
capacity to support axonal regeneration [14, 15, 17, 20, 21],
or transplant cells [16, 22]. However, implanted scaffolds
potentially alter the injury cascade and affecting secondary
injury as well as gliosis [17]. Emphasizing that scaffolds
can provide more than a regenerative substrate for axons or
a vehicle for cell transplantation, fibronectin recently

demonstrated neuroprotective properties in addition to
promoting regeneration [14]. Such hemi-section models
remain difficult to translate into the clinic as spinal cord
tissue is resected or aspirated out of the area. Nonetheless
there are scientific elements in hemi-section models that
are important to investigate, including improving our
understanding of tissue response and material integration
into the spinal cord. For example, an intramedullary
implant model has been recently used to assess biocom-
patibility and long-term (1 year) degradation, using thin
pieces of a biomaterial [23]. Such approaches using smaller
injuries—even though they are not clinically relevant—
might assist fundamental understanding of biomaterial
integration while reducing animal discomfort and care.
While many models generally focus on axonal regen-
eration, in this study we aim to understand the early tissue
response after injury (6 days), and how this is affected by
the implantation of a TE scaffold. To contribute to our
understanding of how the scaffold affects the surrounding
tissue, acute implantations into small injuries of white
matter tracts of the dorsal column were investigated. Our
analysis focused on the astrocytic response, specifically
GFAP, and the distribution of neurocan—a chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) that prevents axonal regen-
eration, both which were down-regulated at the injury site
after pHEMA implantation. The small lesion SCI model
described in this study minimizes both the injury and post-
operative care and is aimed at studying tissue response to
the TE scaffold rather than being clinically relevant.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (China)
unless otherwise indicated. The monomer, 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (#477028), was 99 % purity and used as
received, while the PCL (#440744) had a molecular weight
of 70,000–90,000 g/mol. Methanol (99.5 % purity; #100
14118), chloroform (99 % purity; #10006818) and H2O2
(30 % solution; #10011208) were sourced from SCRC
(China). Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) (#AMR-
0761) was purchased from Mandel Scientific Company Inc.,
(Canada). Hypnorm (0.05 mg/mL) and Hypnovel (1 mg/
mL) were purchased from Yichang Humanwell Pharma-
ceutical Co., Ltd., (China) and Nhwa Pharma Corporation
(China) respectively.
2.2 Electrospinning
An artificial dura to be positioned between the exposed
spinal cord and dorsal muscle tissue was made by
electrospinning PCL using established formulations [24]
and methods [25]. Briefly, a 10 wt% PCL solution (75/25
vol.% chloroform/methanol) was electrospun for 5 min
onto a single aluminum foil collector, with a collector
distance of 10 cm, flow rate of 0.5 mL/h and applied
voltage of 10 kV.
2.3 Hydrogel scaffold
The pHEMA hydrogel scaffold was produced by phase-
separating HEMA through polymerization in excess water
[17, 26]. Briefly, 931 lL of HEMA was mixed with 4.67 g
H2O and 45.6 lL of a 10 % APS solution and cooled in a
refrigerator. TEMED (5.2 lL) was added and a total of
0.5 mL of the solution was injected through a 0.22 lm
PTFE filter into a sterile 1 mL syringe. After 1 h of poly-
merization in the refrigerator, the syringes were removed
and kept at room temperature overnight. Thin slivers
(approximately 0.2 mm) were sliced off the pHEMA
scaffold under a stereomicroscope using a no. 10 scalpel
and UV sterilized.
2.4 Scanning electron microscopy
Both the pHEMA scaffold and electrospun PCL were imaged
with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pHEMA
scaffold was frozen at -20 C, then sections of the hydrogel
cut using a scalpel. These pieces were placed in a 15 mL
Falcon tube and frozen further in liquid nitrogen and
lyophilized overnight. The lyophilized and electrospun PCL
mesh were mounted on stubs and sputter coated with gold
before being imaged (Quanta 200 scanning electron micro-
scope, FEI). A working distance of 13 mm and 10 kV were
used to view the samples. Fiber diameters of the electrospun
PCL mesh were measured by randomly imaging three dif-
ferent regions of the mesh, followed by averaging 20 fibers
per image (n = 60 in total).
2.5 Surgery
The investigations were performed at the Med-X research
institute (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China) and were
subject to the local ethics committee permission. Young
adult male Wistar rats (230–260 g; n = 5 for each group)
were used for the in vivo study. Body temperature under
anesthesia was regulated with a heated mat while surgery
itself performed using a surgical microscope (M651 MSD,
Leica). Under Hypnorm/Hypnovel (2 mL/1.6 mL) injec-
tion anesthesia/analgesia, the back of the rodent was
shaved and the skin sterilized with 70 % alcohol prior to a
2–3 cm incision along the midline, approximately above
T5/T10. Using blunt dissection, the superficial muscle
layers were cleared from the deeper layers, a midline
2002 J Mater Sci: Mater Med (2013) 24:2001–2011
123
incision was made and the superficial and deep muscle
layers retracted to expose the dorsal surface of the T6–T8
vertebrae. Fine bone rongeurs (16021-14, Fine Science
Tools, Germany) were used to perform a laminectomy of
the T7 vertebra, exposing the dorsal surface of the spinal
cord. The dura was cut and reflected with the sharp edge of
a beveled 26G needle tip (#301321, BD Biosciences), after
which a 0.2 mm (rostral/caudal) 9 0.3 mm (bilateral)
section of the cord was identified on the dorsal column
(Fig. 1) that minimized disruption of the spinal cord vas-
culature. A bilateral transverse incision was made in the
dorsal column of the spinal cord, excising out to a depth of
approximately 0.4 mm. A sliver of pHEMA scaffold was
placed next to the injury site and cut into a shape
approximately 0.2 mm 9 0.3 mm 9 0.4 mm in size
(0.24 lL). The scaffold was fitted into the lesion area,
minimizing the pressing down of the material into the
spinal cord. For lesion only controls, the scaffold was not
placed into position. For both the lesion only and pHEMA
scaffold groups, the PCL electrospun membrane was
placed over the exposed site, acting as a fine barrier to
minimize the infiltration of fibroblasts into the SCI paren-
chyma [27, 28]. The skin was closed using 4/0 coated
Vicryl-plus antibacterial sutures (VCP773D, Ethicon,
USA) and animals were socially housed on irradiated
sawdust, 2 animals/cage, in type RU polysulfone cages
(420 9 250 9 230 mm) as part of a rack-based ventilation
system (RU25S7-2, Suhang Technologies, China). Animals
had access to water ad libitum with a 12:12 h light regime.
The following day, all animals moved freely in their cage,
fed and drank without any indication of pain or discomfort.
Animals were sacrificed 6 and 28 days after injury.
2.6 Animal preparation for IHC analysis
Terminal anesthesia was induced with an intra-peritoneal
overdose of ketamine (200 mg/mL; 1.5–2 mL). The animal
was then transcardially perfused with 0.9 % heparinized
saline followed by 10 % formalin buffered saline (FBS).
After approximately 2–3 min of perfusion (approx.
40–60 mL), the injured part of the spinal cord was dis-
sected out and then post-fixed in FBS for 24 h. The spinal
cord was embedded in paraffin wax (Leica EG 1160) and
sagittal sections of 10 lm in thickness (Leica, RM2245)
were taken throughout the areas of interest, including the
pHEMA scaffold and the surrounding tissue.
2.7 Histology and immunohistochemistry
After fixation and embedding, samples were processed for
both histological and immunohistochemical staining as
described previously [29]. Paraffin-embedded sections
underwent sequential solvent exchange from xylene to
100 % ethanol to ethanol mixtures to PBS. The sections
were quenched using a 0.3 % H2O2 methanol solution, and
then heat-mediated antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate
buffer was performed. Primary antibodies were diluted in
PBS with 10 % goat serum and incubated with the prepa-
rations at room temperature for 45 min. Uninjured spinal
cords were stained with luxol fast blue, which identifies
myelin and was used to provide a schematic in Fig. 1.
To identify the maximum injury site, activated macro-
phages and microglia were identified using a monoclonal
antibody against CD68 (1:200, ED-1, MCA341R, Serotec,
USA) [29]. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was
detected with a polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Z0334,
DAKO, USA) while neurocan was identified with a
monoclonal antibody (1:2000, ab26003, Abcam, USA).
Primary antibodies were detected by biotinylated secondary
antibodies (1:200 dilution, #BA-1000 and 2000, Vector
Laboratories, USA). These sections were cover-slipped
with Vectorshield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories, USA) and imaged immediately. For non-
fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) of ED-1, antibody

binding was visualized with avidin–biotin–peroxidase
complex (ABC) (Vector Laboratories, USA) and 3,30-di-
aminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride used as a chromogen.
These sections were then sequentially dehydrated from
ethanol into xylene, followed by embedding with DPX
(#44581, Sigma Life Science), and left to dry overnight.

2.8 Evaluation
Using ImageJ (NIH, USA), the green (GFAP) or red (neu-
rocan) fluorescent images were converted to a grey-scale
image and the mean grey value (intensity) used for quanti-
fication. An approximate threshold was visually set that only
included the GFAP? signal while excluding the background.
This threshold methodology was repeated 3 times/animal,
with 4 animals/group studied, using slides next to the area of
greatest ED-1 immunofluorescence. Using the ventral side
intensity as a control we compared the GFAP? signal
(intensity/region) within a 2 mm (rostral/caudal) 9 0.5 mm
rectangle centered on the injury area. Each GFAP? intensity
measurement (intensity/region) was normalized to an unin-
jured area of the dorsal column to minimize any sample-to-
sample fluorescent staining variations.
For measurement of the spatial distribution of neurocan
across the injury site, a box was overlaid on the injury site
and separated in 200 9 500 lm areas. Each neurocan
intensity measurement (intensity/region) was normalized to
an uninjured area of the dorsal column to minimize any
sample-to-sample fluorescent staining variations. Statistical
tests for the GFAP and neurocan analysis were performed
using MS Excel software. An unpaired student t test was
performed between each groups (normal, lesion and pHE-
MA) using a two-tailed test to determine statistical sig-
nificance (P B 0.05).
3 Results and discussion
Biomaterial-based intervention strategies for bridging SCI
aim to replace damaged tissue with an axon growth pro-
moting substrate, which is able to integrate within the host
tissue. A range of different TE scaffolds have been
implanted in vivo using hemi-section injury models, the
majority of these disrupting a significant portion of the
spinal cord (scaffold volume 10–180 lL; median 36 lL)
and involving a loss of function [14, 17, 20, 21, 23, 30–36].
In the current study, a smaller volume of a TE scaffold
was implanted (approx. 0.25 lL); the objective was to inves-
tigate the integration and the surrounding microenvironment

microglia (ED-1?; red), astrocytes (GFAP?; green) and cell nuclei

of such scaffolds while minimize loss of function to the
animal. Additionally this surgical model disrupts the white
matter tracts of the dorsal column only, while other hemi-
section studies in cause damage to both white and grey
matter. A relatively short post-surgery time point of 6 days
was used for analyzing the inflammatory reaction while tissue
was taken at 28 days to observe integration after longer sur-
vival times to determine regenerative potential.
The choice of species, strain, sex and age (rat; Wistar;
male; young adult) is meant to minimize some of the
fluctuations that can occur after SCI. Male animals are
preferred over females as the latter have fluctuations in
oestrogen levels, which could affect the response to SCI
[37, 38]. The animals undergoing this SCI model required
no manual bladder expression and had minimal loss of
function. Each surgery took approximately 45–60 min,
depending on the extent of bleeding. The pHEMA hydrogel
scaffold fitted readily into the lesion site and fixation was
assisted with fibrin clot formation due to blood vessel

disruption. Figure 1a shows a SEM image of the pHEMA
scaffold, which has open, interconnected pores for cell
invasion. The electrospun PCL membrane (shown in
Fig. 1b) fitted well to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord.
SEM measurements showed that the electrospun membrane
had an average fiber diameter of 480 ± 170 nm. We chose
to implant a non-degradable scaffold, based upon pHEMA,
to establish this small lesion model of the spinal cord. A
degradable TE scaffold could release products that influ-
ence the microenvironment surrounding the implant, which
is not desired in establishing this small lesion model.
Furthermore, this phase-separated hydrogel scaffold has a
history of biomedical use [17, 39, 40], in more severe SCI
models. PHEMA scaffolds can also be readily surface
modified and morphology altered to improve their regen-
erative properties in the spinal cord [18].
In this small lesion model a dorsal relocation of the
pHEMA scaffold occurred after 6 days (Fig. 2a), accom-
panied by localized oedema, or swelling, of the spinal cord,
which occurs naturally shortly after injury [41]. This
oedema was observed in both scaffold and lesion groups.
At 28 days, the pHEMA scaffold was even more dorsally
relocated and it was difficult to find in spinal cord tissue
(Fig. 2b). Since pHEMA is not considerable biodegradable,
its absence in the spinal cord sections indicates that it was
dorsally pushed out of the tissue. It would be important to
understand whether reconstructing the dura as a mechani-
cal barrier will assist or inhibit scaffold integration,
including scarring and ECM production. In this small
lesion model, the pia/dura was not reconstructed to
mechanically prevent the scaffold from being dorsally
relocated. Instead an electrospun PCL non-woven mesh
was placed over the dorsal column, which provides a cell-
impermeable membrane that does not mechanically hold
the scaffold into place. Reconstructing the dura in this
instance would involve suturing the damaged membrane,
providing a mechanical barrier that prevents the oedema
from dorsally relocating the spinal cord tissue. This
approach of using a mechanical barrier could result in
further damage to the spinal cord, as the swollen injured
region compresses surrounding tissue. Even though the
injured tissue/scaffold was pushed dorsally, the microen-
vironment surrounding the implant and lesion could still be
investigated for the 6 days time point. While our goal is to

significantly ventral to the injury for controls (a and c) while the
fluorescent signal for both groups is increased rostral/caudal of the

establish a small lesion SCI model for TE scaffold inte-
gration, the robust dorsal relocation of the scaffold indi-
cates that unmodified pHEMA may not be well-suited for
regeneration in this tissue.
3.1 Immune response
Since SCI is partly driven by inflammatory processes, we
used ED-1 (CD68) staining to determine the center of the
injury so that GFAP and neurocan assessments can be
made at the sites of maximum injury. The ED-1 antibody
stains activated macrophages and microglia; fluorescent
and light micrographs are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 respec-
tively. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, b, the injury center,
immediate parenchyma and the dorsal surface contain the
majority of ED-1? cells while the pHEMA scaffold was
filled almost exclusively with ED-1? cells (Fig. 4d).
Quantitative analysis of ED-1? cells was not accurately
possible, as the tissue dorsal to the injury is structurally
weak and does not adhere well to the slides, with some
lifting off during IHC processing. Since this region con-
tains a significant amount of ED-1? cells, we were unable
to accurately quantify and compare the ED-1 response
between the scaffold and lesion groups. Therefore ED-1
was only used qualitatively to describe activated macro-
phage/microglia distribution and detect the lesion epicenter
for the GFAP and neurocan measurements. The transverse
tissue section shown in Fig. 3c provides a different per-
spective of the injury response, and the surgery. The extent
of ED-1? cells could be found well beyond the depth of
the lesion (0.3 mm).
3.2 Reactive gliosis
The extent of reactive gliosis in the injury parenchyma was
measured through GFAP intensity of fluorescently stained
sections (Fig. 5). GFAP, which is an intermediate filament
within astrocytes, is commonly known to be up-regulated after
injury and a measure of gliosis [42, 43]. However the role that
such intermediate filaments play in the mechanical stabiliza-
tion of CNS tissue is only recently being understood. A recent
article showed that an increase in the intermediate filaments of
astrocytes correlates with the stiffness of the tissue [44] pro-
viding a mechanical barrier to axon regeneration. In this study,
no GFAP labeled filaments can be seen within the injury area
of either group, while GFAP is clearly elevated compared to
Fig. 8 Calculation and comparison of neurocan expression in both
the scaffold and control group. The graph shows the comparison of
neurocan intensity (average intensity/area) between control and
scaffold groups, with significantly different intensities at 0, 200 and
400 lm (P B 0.05). The spinal cord section shown in this example is
from the pHEMA scaffold group

123
the rest of the cord in the injury parenchyma. There was no
GFAP signaling seen within the pHEMA scaffold (Fig. 5d)
indicating no migration of host astrocytes into this region.
Furthermore, the pHEMA group had a significantly lower
(P = 0.008) GFAP signal surrounding the implant area
(Fig. 6) compared to lesion control animals. As would be
expected, the pHEMA group had a statistically higher
(P = 0.01) average GFAP? intensity than uninjured controls.
One possible explanation to the lower GFAP expressions
is that the scaffold rapidly stabilizes the spinal cord
mechanically, before being pushes out by the oedema,
reducing the need for the astrocytes to arrest the extent of
injury. Since scaffolds are a porous material, endogenous
fibrin clots assist in mechanical stabilization through inter-
locking the scaffold pores with the natural tissue. Figure 5d
shows a magnified image of the pHEMA implant with
astrocytes that are approximately 50 lm away from the
pHEMA scaffold. Qualitatively, this compares to the lesion
controls where there is a more extended loss of GFAP signal
around the injury foci. The implantation of cell-invasive
scaffolds has shown a reduction in cystic cavity formation in
other studies including those with poly(hydroxypropyl
methacrylamide) [45], fibronectin [15], collagen [46–48],
and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) [22]. Such scaffolds allow the
infiltration and bonding with spinal cord tissue, possibly
reducing the need for astrocytes to form a dense scar that later
prevents regeneration. The mechanical stabilization of the
injured spinal cord by using injectable hydrogels or scaffolds
has a significant potential for research.
3.3 Distribution of neurocan extracellular matrix
Neurocan is an axon growth inhibitory CSPG that is produced
by astrocytes and is up-regulated after injury to the CNS [49,
50]. In this study we use IHC to determine the distribution of
neurocan at the scaffold/injury site and parenchyma. Figure 7
shows the distribution of neurocan (red fluorescence) in the
injured spinal cord control and pHEMA groups. Increased
neurocan expression could be found in an area surrounding
the lesion site. Interestingly, while neurocan expression was
highest ventral to the lesion site in the lesion-only group, this
area was the lowest in the pHEMA group (Fig. 7). There was
a statistically significant difference between the lesion only
and the pHEMA group in this area (0–400 lm, P \ 0.05,
Fig. 8). Furthermore, the region within the scaffold had very
low levels of neurocan as measured by IHC.
4 Conclusion
In summary, this small lesion animal SCI model allowed us
to investigate the cellular and ECM microenvironment
surrounding a TE scaffold without inflicting a severe injury
on the animal. While such lesion injuries are not widely
perceived as clinically relevant, our goal was to develop an
in vivo model that assesses the host tissue response to an
implanted material. Our approach differs from other hemi-
section models in that we implant a volume that is over 10
times smaller than other studies and into a region of white
matter only. Importantly, the SCI lesion was small and
post-operative care of the animal could be kept to a min-
imum. While the pHEMA scaffold reduced astrocyte gli-
osis and production of the inhibitory ECM protein
neurocan, it was also dorsally relocated at 6 days and
pushed entirely out of the spinal cord after 28 days. This
small lesion in vivo SCI model may allow us to understand
host tissue response to implants for the comparison of
various TE scaffolds.
