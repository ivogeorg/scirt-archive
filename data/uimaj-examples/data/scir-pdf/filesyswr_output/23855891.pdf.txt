Summary
The activation of a complement system can aggravate the secondary injury
after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, it was reported recently that the
activation of a complement could have both a secondary injury and a
neuroprotective effect, in which C5a is the most important factor, but there is
no direct evidence for this dual effect of C5a after SCI. In order to investigate
the potential neuroprotective effect of C5a after SCI, in this study ectogenic
C5a was injected intraperitoneally before/after SCI in vivo, or administrated
to mechanically injured neurones in vitro; following this, neurone apoptosis,
neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration and functional recovery were investi-
gated. The in-vivo experiments indicated that, following treatment with C5a
24 h before or immediately after injury, locomotor function was impaired
significantly. However, when treatment with C5a took place 24 h after injury,
locomotor function improved significantly. In-vitro experiments indicated
that a certain concentration of C5a (50–100 nM) could inhibit caspase-3-
mediated neurone apoptosis by binding to its receptor CD88, and that
it could even promote the neurite outgrowth of uninjured neurones. In
conclusion, delayed post-injury administration of C5a within a certain
concentration could exert its neuroprotective effect through inhibiting
caspase-3-mediated neurone apoptosis and promoting neurite outgrowth of
uninjured neurones as well. These data suggest that C5a may have opposite
functions in a time- and concentration-dependent manner after SCI. The
dual roles of C5a have to be taken into account when measures are taken to
inhibit complement activation in order to promote regeneration after SCI.

Introduction
The role of the complement system after spinal cord injury
(SCI) has received considerable attention. Inhibition of
complement activation can reduce the expression of inflam-
matory factors, improve neuroprotection and attenuate the
secondary injury following SCI [1–4]. Our previous work
indicates that the blocking of complement activation by C3
deficiency has a neuroprotective effect and can improve
regeneration and functional recovery after SCI [5], indicat-
ing that inhibiting complement activation may be a promis-
ing therapy for SCI.
However, it was reported recently that complement
activation had another neuroprotective role [6–9] in
addition to that involving the secondary injury [10,11], and
C5a was thought to be the most important factor in this
respect. Although C5a can induce the chemotactic response
and mediate the early phase of inflammation that is
harmful to cells at the lesion site [12,13], it can exert its
neuroprotective effect by inhibiting neurone apoptosis
[6,7,14] and promoting microglial phagocytosis [15,16],
which is beneficial in alleviating the secondary injury.
However, in terms of SCI, existing research is focused on
the secondary injury caused by C5a, and it is not known
whether it exerts a neuroprotective effect after SCI. If
it does, the favourable and unfavourable roles of C5a have
to be balanced following SCI in order to achieve greater
efficiency in neuroneal regeneration.

Therefore, in the present study the neuroprotective effect
of C5a after SCI was investigated. Our data indicated that
although exogenous C5a administrated before or immedi-
ately after injury exacerbated inflammation after SCI,
delayed post-injury C5a administration could attenuate the
secondary injury and improve regeneration after SCI.
Materials and methods
Spinal cord injury and C5a injection
The study was performed in accordance with protocols
approved by Third Military Medical University. All surgical
procedures were carried out in accordance with the Euro-
pean Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986
(86/609/EEC). Every effort was made to minimize the
number of animals used and their suffering. Female wild-
type C57/BL6 mice (weighing 18–20 g, 6–8 weeks old) were
purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the
Third Military Medical University. In order to minimize the
influence of the oestrogen level, a vaginal smear examina-
tion was performed and only animals in dioestrus were
used. A forceps crush injury was performed using the
procedure described in a previous report [17] after a
laminectomy at T12. Manual bladder expression was
performed twice a day after surgery.
The C5a protein (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was
solubilized in 0·01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). An
effective concentration of C5a (100 nM) was injected
intraperitoneally (10 μl/g body weight) 24 h before injury
(−24 h), immediately after injury (0 h) or 24 h after injury
(24 h), respectively. As for the control, PBS replaced C5a
protein for injection at different time-points.
Locomotor function analysis
Functional recovery after SCI was scored in an open field
using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale.
Animals were assessed daily before and after surgery by an
observer blinded to animal treatment.
Histology analysis
Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde 9 weeks
post-injury. Tissue segments extending from 3 mm rostral
to 3 mm caudal to the lesion site were sectioned in
the longitudinal plane (30 μm) on a cryostat.
Immunohistochemistry was performed for growth-
associated protein-43 (rabbit anti-GAP43, 1:500; Abcam)
according to the protocol described in a previous report
[18], and visualized with a species-specific rhodamine
(tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate: TRITC)-conjugated
antibody (1:500, Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA). The tissue seg-
ments were also used to perform haematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining.
Primary neurone culture and mechanical injury
Newborn mice (0 day) were used for the neurone culture.
After being digested in 0·125% trypsin for 15 min, cells
were collected and resuspended in neurobasal medium
A (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) with 10% B27, 2 mM
glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 10 ng/ml
nerve growth factor (NGF) and plated at a density of
1 × 106/ml.
The neurone mechanical injury was performed accord-
ing to the procedure described in a previous report [19].
In brief, the medium was refreshed 1 day before it was
used. Then ‘#’-like scuffing was performed on neurones
plated on a coverslip. The interval between scratch lines
was 5 mm.
Neurone apoptosis analysis
C5a treatment was performed with different concentra-
tions (50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM) 24 h after the mechanical
injury to the 5-day-old cultures. For the control, 0·01 M
PBS was added into the culture media instead of C5a. To
further confirm the effect of C5a, the C5a receptor antago-
nist AcF-[OP(D-Cha)WR] (PMX53; Shenzhen Jingmei,
Shenzhen, China) was added at the same concentration as
that of C5a in each group. Immunofluorescence staining
was performed 3 days after injury. The proportion of
caspase-3 positive cells (red) to 4′,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI)-positive nuclei (blue) was calcu-
lated by counting, respectively, from 10 random visual
fields under a microscope. The average proportion repre-
sented the ratio of apoptosis neurones to survival
neurones.
Neurite assay
When neurone adherence was completed, different con-
centrations of C5a (50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM) were added
into the culture media for 2 days or 6 days until the
neurite assay was performed. For the control, 0·01 M PBS
was added into the culture media instead of C5a. Three
different visual fields were selected randomly from each
concentration group, and the area occupied by neurites
was quantified using Image Pro. version 5.0 according to
the method described by Bilsland et al. [20]. The average
value of each group was used to represent the neurite
outgrowth.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance between groups was determined by
analysis of variance with repeated measures using Scheffé’s
test for post-hoc comparisons; P < 0·05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Recovery of locomotor function after SCI
Locomotor function was assessed using the BBB scale for 9
weeks after SCI (Fig. 1). The BBB scores of all mice were 0
immediately after SCI, and there was no difference in func-
tional recovery among each of the PBS-treated groups.
When mice were pretreated with C5a 24 h before injury,
locomotor function was impaired significantly in compari-
son with PBS-treated mice. Mice treated with C5a immedi-
ately after injury even showed a remarkable lower score
throughout the observation period. However, locomotor
function improved significantly only when mice were
treated with C5a 24 h after injury.
Analysis of histological recovery
To detect the level of histological recovery, H&E staining
was performed 9 weeks after injury. In mice treated with
PBS, the normal tissue of the spinal cord was damaged and
constricted, and several irregular cavities were formed in the
injured region (Fig. 2a). In mice pretreated with C5a 24 h
before injury (Fig. 2b), especially those treated immediately
after injury (Fig. 2c), the extent of the damage was exacer-
bated, and the areas where there were cavities were
enlarged. However, in mice treated with C5a 24 h after
injury (Fig. 2d) the integrity of the spinal cord was
improved, and the areas where there were cavities were
clearly smaller than those of the other three groups.
Axonal regrowth after SCI
Although several GAP43-positive fibres were observed in
the injured region in mice treated with PBS (Fig. 3a,a′),
fewer GAP43-positive fibres were detected in mice pre-
treated with C5a 24 h before injury (Fig. 3b,b′, P < 0·01
versus the PBS group). In mice treated with C5a
immediately after injury, very few GAP43-positive fibres
could be detected (Fig. 3c,c′, P < 0·01 versus the PBS group).
However, in mice treated with C5a 24 h after injury
(Fig. 3d,d′), more GAP43-positive fibres were observed

period. However, locomotor function improved significantly only when mice were treated with C5a 24 h after injury (C5a, 24 h); n = 5 per group.

than was the case with the PBS-treated mice (P < 0·05),
suggesting that delayed post-injury administration of C5a
can promote axonal regrowth in the injured spinal cord.
Neurone apoptosis
At lower concentrations of C5a (50 nM, 100 nM), neurone
apoptosis was inhibited significantly by 38% (P < 0·05)
and 45% (P < 0·01), respectively (Fig. 4b,b′,c,c′,i).
However, at a higher concentration (200 nM), the
apoptosis was no longer inhibited by C5a (Fig. 4d,d′,i).
The apoptosis cells increased significantly compared with
those in the 50 nM and 100 nM groups, and even exceeded
the level of the control group (P < 0·01) (Fig. 4a,a′,i). This
inhibition effect could be reversed by PMX53 administra-
tion (Fig. 4e–h,e′–h′,i).

Neurite outgrowth
Neurite outgrowth could be observed in each group at 2
days, with no significant difference in neurite areas being
observed between the control (Fig. 5a,i), 50 nM (Fig. 5b,i)
and 100 nM (Fig. 5c,i) groups. However, the neurite area of
the 200 nM group (Fig. 5d,i) was significantly lower than
that of the other three groups (P < 0·05). A large quantity of
interlacing neurites could be observed in each group at 6
days, with significantly larger neurite areas in the 50 nM
(Fig. 5f,i) and 100 nM (Fig. 5g,i) groups than in the control
(P < 0·05) (Fig. 5e,i). For the 200 nM group (Fig. 5h,i), its
neurite area was slightly smaller than that of the control,
but the difference was not significant.
Discussion
Among complement components, C5a is thought to be the
most effective inflammatory factor. Following central
nervous system (CNS) lesions, C5a exerts its role by binding
to its receptor, and CD88 is considered to be its main
functional receptor [21,22]. C5a can induce neutrophil
chemotaxis, up-regulate the expression of CD11b, interleu-
kin (IL-2) IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
and mediate the secondary injury after SCI [12,13,23,24].
Meanwhile, there is positive feedback between the expres-
sion of TNF-α and that of CD88 [25]. Administration of
C5a before or immediately after SCI will promote this feed-
back and increase the expression of endogenous C5a, CD88

and TNF-α, and ultimately aggravate the secondary injury
after SCI. The differing degrees of injury observed between
the −24 h and 0 h groups may be relevant in terms of the
metabolism of C5a. C5a in vivo is quickly metabolized by
carboxypeptidases to form C5adesArg [26]. It was thought
previously that both C5a and C5adesArg could be cleared
from the body with a half-life of 2–3 min, mediated partly
by internalization by CD88 and C5L2 [27,28]. However, a
recent study has indicated that the C5a internalized by
CD88 is not retained and degraded. Instead, it is released

into the extracellular medium in an intact state [28], so this
part of C5a is not really cleared and could still participate in
the secondary injury. Therefore, C5a administered 24 h
before SCI might be only partially cleared, and that still
remaining might participate in the secondary injury. When
C5a was administered immediately after SCI, all of it par-
ticipated in the secondary injury before it had time to be
cleared. This could probably explain why the degree of
injury in the −24 h group was more severe than that in the
control, but better than in the 0 h group.
It is worth noting that C5a administered 24 h after SCI
attenuated the secondary injury and enhanced the func-
tional recovery. Our previous work showed that the expres-
sion of both C5a and CD88 increased, and peaked at 24 h
after SCI [25]. Instead of exacerbating the secondary injury,
C5a administration at this time-point reduced it signifi-
cantly, suggesting an alternative role. Vidal et al. [29]
reported that the inhibition of peripheral TNF-α, starting
14 days after injury, had no effect on functional recovery
after SCI. Beck et al. [30] reported that late inflammation
14 days post-injury could promote functional recovery and
myelination after SCI, and the macrophage/microglia
response might prevent the further loss of function during
the early chronic phase (14–28 days after injury) of inflam-
mation. These studies indicated that the acute phase of
inflammation might exacerbate the secondary injury after
SCI, while the chronic phase could have a protective effect.
Even C5a could probably have an opposite role during this
second phase, as Beck et al. [30] predicted that the blocking
of subacute to chronic inflammation by the C5a receptor
antagonist would reduce functional recovery after SCI,
which was confirmed in CD88−/− mice by Brennan et al.
[9]. Perhaps for this reason, in our study the functional
recovery of control mice started from 15 days after injury.
When mice were treated with C5a 24 h after SCI the prob-
able neuroprotective effect of C5a, rather than its
proinflammatory effect, resulted in enhanced functional
recovery. However, the precise time window during which
C5a exerts this protective effect needs to be studied further.
To investigate further the neuroprotective role of C5a, we
observed its effect on neural survival and neurite outgrowth
and found that C5a within a certain concentration range
(50–100 nM) could reduce the apoptosis of injured neu-
rones and promote the neurite outgrowth of uninjured
neurones, which indicated that the effect of C5a on neu-
rones was related to the concentration range as well as to
the time window. The inflammatory effect of C5a could
convert to a neuroprotective effect as its concentration
changed. It was reported that the expression of the C5a
receptor in neurones remained weak under normal physi-
ological conditions but increased significantly when stimu-
lated by inflammation [25], which could be a self-
protection response. For example, Mukherjee and Pasinetti
[6] found that the neurones in the hippocampus that were
pretreated with C5a showed high tolerance to glutamate,
and Bénard et al. [7] reported that the C5a receptor antago-
nist could promote neural survival. Our data also showed
that a certain concentration of C5a could reduce the
caspase-3 mediated apoptosis of injured neurones, and that
this effect could be reversed by PMX53 administration.
Therefore, C5a could exert its neuroprotective effect by
binding to its receptor on the neurone surface, inhibiting
the expression of caspase-3 and ultimately reducing
neurone apoptosis. To our surprise, in the case of uninjured
neurones C5a could promote outgrowth of their neurites,
which was a further illustration of its promotion of neural
regeneration in vivo, although the mechanism is as yet
unknown.
Finally, it should be noted that the localized concentra-
tion of C5a in the spinal cord after injection of 100 nM C5a
into the peritoneum was much lower than the in-vitro con-
centrations. Why did it still work? The answer may involve
the positive feedback between C5a and inflammation in
vivo. On one hand, uncontrolled complement activation
can lead to excessive inflammation, tissue damage and
elevation of many cytokines [31]. On the other hand, par-
ticularly after stimulation with cytokines, glial cells and
neurones can produce almost all the complement proteins
(including C5) [32], and activation and over-expression of
C5a can be detected during inflammatory processes [33].
Exogenous administration of C5a will promote this feed-
back and generate more endogenic C5a. Therefore, the
C5a that really played a role in vivo might come from
two sources: exogenous administration and endogenic
generation.
Conclusion
C5a has been thought to be a chemotactic factor that par-
ticipates in inflammation and results in the secondary
injury after SCI. However, our study indicated that a certain
concentration of C5a administrated 24 h after injury could
reduce neurone apoptosis, promote neurite outgrowth and
improve functional recovery after SCI. These data suggest
that C5a may have opposite functions in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner after SCI. The dual roles
of C5a have to be taken into account when measures
to inhibit complement activation are taken in order to
promote regeneration after SCI.
