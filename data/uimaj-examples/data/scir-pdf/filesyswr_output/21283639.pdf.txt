Abstract
Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in permanent functional loss. This physical trauma leads to secondary
events, such as the deposition of inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) within astroglial scar tissue at the
lesion.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined whether local delivery of constitutively active (CA) Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and
Rac1 to the lesion site alleviated CSPG-mediated inhibition of regenerating axons. A dorsal over-hemisection lesion was
created in the rat spinal cord and the resulting cavity was conformally filled with an in situ gelling hydrogel combined with
lipid microtubes that slowly released constitutively active (CA) Cdc42, Rac1, or Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
Treatment with BDNF, CA-Cdc42, or CA-Rac1 reduced the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes, as well as CSPG deposition,
at the interface of the implanted hydrogel and host tissue. Neurofilament 160kDa positively stained axons traversed the glial
scar extensively, entering the hydrogel-filled cavity in the treatments with BDNF and CA-Rho GTPases. The treated animals
had a higher percentage of axons from the corticospinal tract that traversed the CSPG-rich regions located proximal to the
lesion site.
Conclusion: Local delivery of CA-Cdc42, CA-Rac1, and BDNF may have a significant therapeutic role in overcoming CSPG-
mediated regenerative failure after SCI.

Introduction
Physical injury to the spinal cord results in the damage and
death of neurons and axons, leading to loss of both sensory and
motor neuronal function. Injury triggers a cascade of events,
including the migration of macrophages and activation of resident
glial cells, microglia and astrocytes [1]. These cells express and
deposit chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that contribute
to regenerative failure by forming a repulsive barrier to growth
cones [2,3]. Besides CSPGs, myelin-associated inhibitory mole-
cules including myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) [4,5], Nogo
[6], and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) [7], located
on the inner myelin sheath, are exposed after physical injury,
further contributing to the inhibitory environment, thus impeding
axonal growth. Therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming these
inhibitory regions usually target one of these proteins.
However, as more than one ‘inhibitory’ entity exists after spinal
cord injury (SCI), we examined a strategy to alter the intrinsic
axonal responses to inhibitory cues using an in situ gelling hydrogel
system [8] to deliver constitutively active (CA) Rho GTPases and
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Our approach served
to: (1) physically bridge the lesion, providing an axon growth
permissive substrate for regenerating and sprouting nerve fibers,
and (2) allow the local, slow release delivery of protein(s), such as
CA-Rho GTPases or BDNF for a period of at least 2 weeks.
Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, are responsible for the
filopodial and lamellopodial extension of axonal growth cones
[9,10], whereas activation of Rho leads to growth cone collapse
[10]. One of the main pathways through which Cdc42 promotes
filopodial extension is the Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
Protein (N-WASP) and Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (ARP 2/3)
Complex [11]. Activation of Cdc42 in turn leads to an immediate
activation of Rac1 due to cross-talk [12]. The downstream
effectors for Rac1, which activates actin polymerization are Insulin
receptor substrate p53 and WASP famlily verprolin-homologous
protein (WAVE) [13]. When either CA-Cdc42 and CA-Rac1, or
inhibitors of Rho and its signaling pathways were transduced into
neurons in vitro, neurites extend through inhibitory, CSPG-rich
regions [14,15,16,17]. Additionally, when inhibitors to Rho and
ROCK were delivered in vivo, axonal regeneration was enhanced
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e16135
[18]. However, axon re-growth was not significant after C3
transferase, a bacterial toxin that inhibits Rho, was transduced
[19]. To date, the roles of CA-Cdc42 and CA-Rac1 have not been
examined in vivo after SCI. Therefore, to our knowledge this is the
first study to provide controlled release of Cdc42 and Rac1 in vivo.
Distinct from altering growth cone sensitivity to inhibitory
signals, it is important to promote neuronal survival and stimulate
axon growth. Neurotrophins, such as BDNF, neurotrophin-3 (NT-
3), and nerve growth factor (NGF), are neuroprotective in vivo [20],
as well as stimulate axonal growth [21,22]. We have previously
demonstrated that local sustained delivery of BDNF is a potential
strategy to promote axonal sprouting after SCI [8].
In this study, an agarose hydrogel scaffold embedded with lipid
microtube delivery vehicles that provide local, sustained bioavail-
ability in vivo was used to deliver CA-Cdc42, CA-Rac1, and BDNF
after SCI. Our results demonstrated that there was in vivo release
for at least 2 weeks, and all three treatments had an effect on the
reduction of reactive astrocytes and CSPG deposition, and axonal
growth within the inhibitory CSPG-rich regions. CA-Cdc42
significantly reduced the amount of reactive astrocytes and CSPG
deposition, and treatment with CA-Rac1 and BDNF had a
statistically higher number of axons growing within inhibitory
CSPG-rich regions compared to the untreated control.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal
practices as defined by the relevant national and/or local
guidelines. All animal procedures were approved (Protocol ID
A04016) by the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use (IACUC) Committee.
Fabrication and Loading of Lipid Microtubes for
sustained release of CA-Rac1, CA-Cdc42 and BDNF
Lipid microtubes were fabricated as previously described
[23,24]. Briefly, 1,2-bis-(tricosa-10,12-diynoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phos-
phocholine (DC8,9PC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was
dissolved in 70% ethanol at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The
lipid was placed in a water bath (Thermo NESLAB, Portsmouth,
NH) programmed to decrease from 50 to 20uC over 48 h and then
stored at room temperature to facilitate self-assembly of lipid
microtubes. Trehalose (18.9 mg/mL) was added to the microtu-
bule solution and then dehydrated using a rotary evaporator. For
the various treatments, 1 mg of dehydrated microtubes were
loaded with BDNF (Millipore, Temecula, CA), CA-Cdc42, or CA-
Rac1 and the loading concentrations were 500 mg/mL, 500 mg/
mL and 230 mg/ml, respectively. The protein loaded microtubes
were mixed into 2.6% agarose (w/v) at a 1:1 volume ratio.
Characterization of Microtubule Mediated Slow Release
of BDNF In Vitro
Eighty microliters of 500 mg/mL BDNF was loaded into 2 mg
of lipid microtubes by incubating the BDNF solution with
dehydrated microtubes. The BDNF loaded microtubes were
mixed into 2.6% agarose to obtain a microtubule concentration
of 8.33 mg/mL in 1.3% concentration of agarose. Forty
microliters of the BDNF loaded microtubes and agarose mixture
was added into well of a 96 well plate, allowed to gel, and 150 mL
of PBS was added to the above mixture. The 96 well plate was
placed in a 37uC oven and after the first 24 hours, the 150 mL of
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was removed and replaced with
150 mL of fresh PBS. This method was followed every 48 hours for
the following 13 days. The retrieved PBS solutions were stored in
220uC until they were ready to be analyzed for BDNF content.
The BDNF released from the microtubes was quantified using the
BDNF ELISA Sandwich Kit (Chemicon) and then the standard
and sample wells were placed in the Synergy HT Micro Detection
Microplate Reader (BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT)
and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. A standard curve was
obtained from the absorbances of the BDNF standards to
determine the concentrations of the BDNF released in the PBS.
Rhodamine Conjugation to BDNF for Characterization of
Lipid Microtube Mediated Slow Release In Vivo
To permit visualization and characterization of BDNF’s diffusion
through spinal cord tissue, Rhodamine was conjugated to BDNF.
The protocol provided with the EZ-LabelTM Rhodamine Protein
Labeling Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) that allows Rhodamine to be
conjugated to most biomolecules using primary amines was
followed to conjugate the Rhodamine to BDNF (BDNF/Rhoda-
mine). The BDNF/Rhodamine was diluted to 500 mg/mL and then
loaded to the microtubes as described above. The agarose/BDNF/
Rhodamine loaded microtubes mixture was injected into the spinal
cord as described below. After 2 weeks the spinal cords were
retrieved and processed, as described in further detail below.
TAT Rho GTPase Protein Expression and Purification
TAT Rho GTPase fusion proteins were prepared as previously
described [25]. The pTAT-HA vector contains an N9 terminal 6-
histidine leader followed by the 11 amino acid TAT protein
transduction domain flanked by glycine residues, a hemaglutinin
tag and a polylinker. Expression plasmids for constitutively active
(CA) and dominant negative (DN) Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 were
kindly provided by Dr. Steven Dowdy (UCSD, CA) [26]. The
expression plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS
competent cells (Novagen). A 100–200 ml LB overnight culture
was started, then the entire volume was inoculated into 1 L of LB
plus 200 mM IPTG and shaken for 5 hr at 37uC. The cell pellet
was washed in PBS. Cells were resuspended in 16PBS containing
2 ml/ml protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 1 ml/ml 1M
benzamidine, sonicated on ice three times for 30 s and centrifuged
at 4200 rpm for 25 min at 4uC. The supernatant was applied to
1 ml packed Talon Metal Affinity Resin (BD Biosciences,
Clontech) to bind to the His-tag of the Rho GTPase fusion
proteins and rocked overnight at 4uC. Beads were pelleted
(1500 rpm, 3 min, 4uC) and washed three times with 10 ml 16
PBS/protease inhibitor cocktail/benzamidine followed by 3
additional washes with 10 ml 16 PBS. Protein was eluted from
beads with 16 PBS containing 200 mM imidazole. Purified
proteins were dialyzed into appropriate buffers for the experiment.
Surgical Procedures
In situ gelling of Agarose-Protein Scaffolds in aDorsal Over-
hemisection Model In Vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley (Charles
River Laboratory) rats weighing 190–230 grams were anesthetized
with NembutalH. The skin and muscle were opened to expose the
thoracic vertebrae T8–T10 and the underlying spinal cord was
exposed. A modified dorsal-over hemisection was made by creating a
2 mm62 mm61.5 mm deep cavity thereby removing the dorsal
portion of the corticospinal tract (CST). Four microliters of a protein
loaded microtubes/agarose solution was injected into the cavity. A
cooling system was used to gel the agarose scaffold containing the
microtubes loaded with protein [8]. The muscle and the skin were
closed in layers. The animals were given Buprenoprhine post-surgery.
The animal bladders were manually expressed twice a day until
urinary function was recovered. There were 6 animals in each group.

Anterograde Neuronal Tracer Injection into the
Corticospinal Tract. Four weeks post-injury, biotinylated
dextran amine (BDA, Invitrogen) was bilaterally injected into the
motor cortex to trace the axons in the corticospinal tract (CST).
The animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and maintained
through the surgery at 0.5% isoflurane. The skin and the
periosteum were opened to expose the skull. Three injection
sites, located within each hemisphere 2 mm from the midline and
1 mm apart from each site, were used to inject 0.5 mL of BDA at
each site over 2 min. Six weeks post-injury (two weeks after BDA
injection), the animals were anesthetized with ketamine (1 mL/kg),
xylazine (0.17 mL/kg), and Acepromazine (0.37 mL/kg),
transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, the spinal
cords were retrieved, and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight and then stored in PBS containing 0.01% sodium azide.
Immunohistochemistry and Histological Evaluation of
Explanted Spinal Cords and Hydrogels. Serial sagittal
sections (25 mm) of the spinal cords were cut on a cryostat (Leica
CM 300, Leica, Bannockburn, IL) and mounted onto glass slides.
To visualize reactive astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, and
labeled axons, a triple-stain was performed using anti-rabbit glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Chemicon), ED-1 (mouse anti-rat
CD68, Serotec, Raleigh, NC), and BDA. The sections were
incubated in 4% goat serum in 0.5% Triton-X 100 for 1 hour.
GFAP (1:1000) and ED-1 (1:1000) in 4% goat serum and 0.5%
Triton-X 100 were added to the sections and incubated at 4uC
overnight. The secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 350 goat anti-
rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), Alexa
Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse (1:200 dilution) (Molecular Probes), and
Alexa Fluor 488 Streptavidin (1:200) were added for GFAP, ED-1,
and BDA, respectively, and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at
room temperature. The sections were rinsed twice with 0.1M PBS
and covered with glass coverslips.
A triple stain was also done with BDA, GFAP and CS-56, an
antibody to identify growth inhibitory CSPGs (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). Spinal cord sections were incubated overnight at 4uC with
anti-GFAP and CS-56 (1:250) in 4% goat serum and 0.5% Triton-X
100. The secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 350 goat anti-rabbit
(1:200), Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgM (1:200), and Alexa
Fluor 488 Streptavidin (1:200) were added as described above. In
addition, to help visualize the axons and neurons at the injury site a
double stain with BDA and anti-mouse Neurofilament 160 kDa
(NF-160 kDa, Sigma) was performed as described above. An anti-
rabbit calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP, Chemicon) was used
to identify sensory fibers around the lesion site. All images were taken
on the Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).
Quantitative Analysis of Cellular, Molecular, and Axonal
Response to Scaffold and Protein
Methodology for GFAP and CS-56 Analysis: Identifying the
inhibitory regions. The methodology to quantify the
fluorescent intensity of GFAP and CS-56 images has been
previously published [8]. All images were taken at the same
exposure time and conditions. A minimum of 60 images (4 images/
spinal cord section65 spinal cord section/each animal63 animals)
per experimental group was utilized to obtain the overall average
intensity profiles for each staining representing 1800 different
individual intensity profiles per condition. The overall average
intensity profiles for both GFAP and CS-56 as function of distance
from the interface was compared between experimental groups.
Quantification of Average Lesion Area. The lesion area
was identified as the cavity surrounded by the GFAP+ stained
boundary. Ten sections that were located at the epicenter of the
lesion were used to determine the lesion area. The lesion area was
measured using ImagePro software and the average was then
calculated for each of the conditions.
Quantification of ED-1+ Cells. The number of ED-1+ cells
in and around the lesion site was quantified. Two 106 images
were taken of each section using an Olympus digital camera
attached to the Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope. ImagePro
software (Media Cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA) was used to count the
number of cells that were present. Two parameters, (1) the
fluorescent intensity and (2) cell diameter, were kept constant for
all the images of the different conditions when counting the cells.
Quantification of BDA+ Axons. Spinal cord sections stained
for BDA+ axons were imaged at 106 on the Nikon Eclipse 80i
upright microscope using a Microfire CCD camera (Optronics,
Goleta, CA) that interfaced with the Neurolucida software
(MicroBrightField Bioscience, Williston, VT) to obtain a
montage of each section. The images were used to measure
axon distance from the lesion site for all of the conditions. The
distance between the 3 or more closest axons, with dystrophic
endbulbs, and the lesion site was measured using ImagePro
Software.
The beginning of the proximal side of the lesion was marked as
0 mm and every millimeter was marked and ‘binned’ up to a
distance of 4 mm rostral to the lesion site. The number of axons
4 mm proximal to the lesion site was considered to be the original
number of axons in the CST and is written as total number of
axons at 4mm in the equation below. The number of BDA+ axons,
from 0 to 1 mm, 1 to 2 mm, 2 to 3 mm, and 3 to 4 mm, proximal
to the injury site was counted using 106 montage images. The
percent of axonal outgrowth was determined by the following
equation:
(Number of axons at specific distance range/Total number of
axons at 4 mm) * 100
Distance of Axonal Growth Through and Within
Inhibitory Regions. CSPGs are present in the glial scar
around the lesion area at high levels in the immediate vicinity of
the lesion, but extending up to 400–500 microns away from the
lesion border. The fluorescent intensity values of CS-56 stained
regions were used to identify these ‘inhibitory regions’. To
determine the degree to which regenerating axons where able to
overcome CSPG-mediated inhibition, BDA+ axons were placed in
three categories: (1) axons that stopped before the CS-56+
inhibitory region, (2) axons crossed the proximal interface of the
inhibitory region but stopped within the inhibitory region, and (3)
axons that crossed the distal interface of the inhibitory region and
grew past it; and counted. A percent of axons in each region was
determined by the following equation:
(No. of axons in region/Total number of axons in all 3 regions)
*100
The axons that had stopped within the inhibitory region
mentioned in the section above were then measured to determine
the distance extended after crossing the proximal interface. The
shortest total distance extended by the axons within the inhibitory
region was measured and then averaged. The length of all the
axons that stopped their outgrowth within this region was
measured and then averaged for each condition. The percent of
the distance extended by the axons within the CS-56 region was
calculated by the following equation:
(Average Axonal Distance Extended/Total Length of Inhibitory
Region) *100
Statistical Analysis
GFAP, CS-56, and NF-160: The area under the curve of the
overall average intensity profiles was determined for four different
distance ‘bins’: 0 to 100 mm, 100 to 200 mm, 200 to 300 mm, and

300 to 400 mm from the interface extending into the spinal cord.
The area under the curve of the profiles was statistically compared
by ANOVA and the post-hoc test Tukey’s test (P,0.05). To
determine if there was significant difference amongst the
conditions and between different groups, ANOVA and Tukey’s
test (P,0.05) was performed for all other analysis.

extracellularly and has the potential to be taken up by both
resident and migrating cells.
Cellular and Molecular Response Around Lesion Site
Six weeks post injury, regions with reactive astrocytes (high
GFAP intensity) are generally correlated with increased CSPG
deposition (CS-56 intensity) (Fig. 2A). Untreated controls have
high levels of GFAP and CS-56. Use of the agarose hydrogel alone
caused a reduction in reactive astrocytes (GFAP). When quantified
(Figs. 2B–C), the GFAP and CS-56 intensity is statistically lower in
CA-Cdc42, CA-Rac1, and BDNF treated animals as compared to
the untreated controls. In addition, CA-Cdc42 delivery resulted in
significantly lower GFAP and CS-56 intensity compared to the
agarose control.

The average lesion area was measured for all the experimental
groups to determine if the treatments caused a greater secondary
injury. The average lesion area for the untreated and agarose
controls was greater than 1 mm2, which was significantly larger
than all of the treated groups, BDNF, CA-Cdc42, and CA-Rac1
that had an area approximately 0.7 mm2 (Fig. 3A). These data
indicate that treatment results in a smaller lesion cavity than even
in the agarose control.
Besides staining for GFAP and CS-56 for a cellular and
molecular response at 6 weeks, reactive microglia/macrophages in
and around the lesion site were quantified by counting the number
of ED-1+ cells (Fig. 3B). A statistical difference between
experimental and control treated animals was not observed.
Sprouting Axonal Tracts
NF-160 was used to observe whether there were axons located in
the hydrogel scaffold and the glial scar (Fig. 4A). The NF-160 stain
was quantified using the customMATLAB program utilized for the
GFAP and CS-56 analysis. In the untreated and agarose controls,
the NF-160 staining did not have measurable intensity beyond
150 mm into the scaffold (Fig. 4B). However, the treatment groups,
BDNF, CA-Cdc42, and CA-Rac1, had a significantly higher
fluorescent intensity compared to the controls and the intensity
levels remained consistent throughout the scaffold. NF-160+
neurons had extended significantly further through the hydrogel
scaffold in the treated animals compared to the untreated and
agarose controls (Fig. 4B). A significant difference was not observed
amongst the treatment groups. NF-160 staining identifies a variety
of axons within the spinal cord. An antibody against the sensory
neuropeptide CGRP was used. As it was observed that the scaffolds
in the treatment groups (BDNF, CA-Cdc42, and CA-Rac1) were
positive for NF-160, an antibody against CGRP was used to identify
the type of axons. It was observed that CGRP+ sensory axons were
present in the treated hydrogel scaffolds, which can be seen in the
fluorescent images (Fig. 5). Therefore, some of the NF-160+ staining
are CGRP+ sensory axons within the hydrogel scaffold.
BDA+ Axons are Present in Glial Scar after Treatment

the dorsal column were severed during the dorsal-over hemisec-
tion. The axons were labeled with BDA to visualize their location
in regards to the lesion site (Fig. 6A). The images on the right show
the closest axons to the lesion site. Axons with dystrophic endbulbs
retracted over 1 mm from the beginning of the lesion site in both
the untreated and agarose conditions (Fig. 6B). All treatments
showed a reduction in axonal retraction compared to controls.
However, in animals with BDNF and CA-Rac1 treatment, axons
were within 400 mm proximal to the lesion site, which is
significantly closer compared to the other conditions. These data
suggest that axonal dieback or retraction was altered by BDNF
and CA-Cdc42 and CA-Rac1 treatment of the lesion cavity.
In addition to measuring the distance from the lesion site to the
closest axons, the percent of axons every millimeter from 4 mm
proximal to the lesion site was determined (Fig. 6C). The number of
axons that were present at 4 mm was considered to be the total
number of axons present both before and after the lesion. By 2 mm,
there were greater percentage of axons in the treated groups, BDNF,
CA-Cdc42, and CA-Rac1, which were 58%, 68%, and 73%, respec-
tively, compared to the 40 and 44% of untreated and agarose controls
(Fig. 6C). Between the ranges of 0 to 1 mm, there were 20–35% axons
near the lesion in the treatment groups, where as in the controls, axons
were not present within 1 mm proximal to the lesion site.
Crossing of Axons through Inhibitory Regions In Vivo
CSPG containing regions (CS-56 positive) were identified
proximal to the lesion site in the treated and control groups. The
area was considered to be inhibitory if the CS-56 pixel intensity
values were within the range of those in the glial scar bordering the
lesion (Fig. 7). The numbers of axons which traversed the region,
stopped within the inhibitory region, or stopped proximal to the
inhibitory region interface were counted. The percentage of axons
that stopped in each of the 3 regions was determined (Fig. 7E). All
three experimental groups had significantly higher percentage of
axons that traversed the distal interface of the inhibitory regions
compared to the control groups. The animals treated with CA-Rac1
had the highest number of axons that crossed the proximal interface
of the inhibitory region compared to the untreated or agarose-
treated animals. This can be seen in Figure 7B–D. However, in all
the conditions, a high percentage of axons, 45–65%, stopped within
the inhibitory region (Figure 7F).
Discussion
This study was performed to determine whether utilizing the
hydrogel/microtubule scaffold delivery system to deliver BDNF,
CA-Cdc42, or CA-Rac1 would decrease the sensitivity of growth
cones to CSPGs, and promote axonal growth through CSPG-rich
regions at the lesion site. First, the use of the in situ gelling hydrogel
allows the lesion cavity to be conformally filled. Second, the lipid
microtubes allow slow release of therapeutics from the hydrogel
over time. Third, this strategy allows neuroprotective or axonal
migration stimulators to be delivered locally over time.
Lipid microtubes were embedded within in situ gelling hydrogels
that released CA-Cdc42, CA-Rac1, or BDNF over time. The
sustained release profile of BDNF was characterized in vivo. Two

weeks post-implantation, BDNF/Rhodamine is present around
the lesion site, demonstrating at least 2 week release, as well as
diffusion 2 mm from the lesion site (Fig. 1). This represents a
critical period due to the formation of the glial scar and axonal
retraction from the lesion site. Therefore, our delivery system
affects the inhibitory response and axonal regrowth due to the
proteins being available in the microenvironment and potentially
taken up by microglia, macrophages, astrocytes, as well as

and control spinal cords. The distance of 3 or more axons from the lesion site in each image was averaged. All the treated cords had axons within
1 mm of the lesion site and were significantly closer to the lesion site compared to the untreated and agarose treated cords. BDNF and CA-Rac1 were
the most effective treatments and were within 400 mm to the lesion site. The data represents mean 6 SEM. One way ANOVA and Tukey’s test were
used to statistically analyze the data. (A p,0.05 compared to untreated controls and B p,0.05 compared to agarose control). C. Percent of axonal
outgrowth towards the lesion site. The percent of axons was measured from 4 mm proximal to the beginning of the lesion site. The graph shows that
2 mm from the lesion site, the 68–72% of the axons are present in the conditions treated with CA-Cdc42 and CA-Rac1 compared to the untreated and
agarose controls, which had significantly lower percent of axons (45–50%). One millimeter away from the lesion site, there were not any axons in the
control conditions, where as there were 35–45% of the axons in the spinal cords treated with CA-Rac1. The data represents mean 6 SEM (A p,0.05
compared to untreated control and B p,0.05 compared to agarose).

neurons. The Rho GTPases are likely to display similar release
characteristics from the microtubes due to the molecular weight of
BDNF and the Rho GTPases both being approximately 25 kDa.
Previous data from our laboratory demonstrated that the
molecular weight determines the release characteristics from the
microtubes and the neurotrophins are bioactive after release for at
least two weeks in vitro [23,24].
Animals treated with CA-Cdc42, CA-Rac1, and BDNF had
significantly lower expression of GFAP and CSPGs than untreated
controls. BDNF and Cdc42 treated spinal cords had the greatest

significantly higher percentage than in the spinal cords treated with CA-Rac1. G. In the spinal cords treated with CA-Rac1, the axons extended a

reduction in CS-56 fluorescent intensity suggesting a reduction in
CSPGs. It has been shown that Rho-associated kinase (ROK), a
downstream effector of Rho, phosphorylates GFAP [27]. Cross-
talk among the Rho GTPases has been well established, where
activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 causes down-regulation of Rho.
Therefore, if Rho is down-regulated due to the delivery of CA-
Cdc42, CA-Rac1, and BDNF, then ROK may also be down-
regulated, which could influence the phosphorylation of GFAP.
Some studies have used chABC to digest the CSPGs in the
inhibitory environment [28,29,30,31]. This is a so called
‘‘extrinsic’’ strategy. While promising, there may be other
inhibitory entities in astroglial scar tissue, such as the myelin
inhibitory proteins. Therefore, the advantage of the ‘intrinsic’
strategy aimed at altering intracellular signaling that regulates
growth cone sensitivity to inhibitory cues is that it may act
independently of which inhibitors are present in the lesion. It was
seen in Figure 2 and Figure 3, that the agarose control group had
GFAP and CS-56 intensities and lesion volume that were
statistically higher than the treated conditions. However, agarose
statistically does not elicit a higher astrocytic response or CSPG
deposition compared to the injured control. Also, Figure 3B
demonstrates that the number of microglia and macrophages,
counted using ED-1+ stain, is not higher compared to the other
conditions. We believe that agarose is a neutral scaffold. That it
does not prohibit nor promote axonal growth or increase the
immune/inflammatory response.
In addition to the initial injury, secondary injury leads to the
increase in the lesion size. It is important that the therapeutic
strategies do not enhance lesion size. In a study using anti-
transforming growth factor-b, although the antibody reduced
astorycytosis, the lesion size increased [32]. In this study, the lesion
area was measured to observe whether there was a similar
occurrence. A difference in the reactivity of the astrocytes was
observed in the treatment conditions, therefore, we wanted to
quantify the lesion. However, the treated groups, BDNF, CA-Cdc42,
and Rac1, decreased the lesion area compared to the controls. This
suggests that BDNF, CA-Cdc42, and Rac1 may have influenced the
reactivity and migratory response of the microglia and macrophages,
which led to a decrease in inflammatory cytokine production.
Numerous NF-160+ axons were present in the treated animals.
CGRP+ sensory axons infiltrated the inhibitory glial scar and the
scaffold compared to the untreated and agarose controls. In vivo
studies have shown that BDNF helps stimulate axonal outgrowth
of sensory fibers [21,22]. In our study, BDNF and the Rho
GTPases, CA-Cdc42 and CA-Rac1, aid in axonal outgrowth of
the sensory fibers. After injury, axonal retraction occurs for both
ascending and descending tracts. Our data suggest that the
retracted axons in the ascending sensory tracts extended through
the glial scar surrounding the lesion site distal to the hydrogel/
microtube filled spinal cord cavity due to the delivery of Cdc42,
Rac1, and BDNF. This demonstrates that delivery of Cdc42,
Rac1, and BDNF may have a therapeutic effect on axonal
outgrowth after injury. The dosage of the three proteins may not
have been at an optimal concentration or duration to stimulate
axonal growth in the CST, however, the amount of protein was
sufficient to promote growth of ascending sensory tracts.
The effect of BDNF, CA-Cdc42, and CA-Rac1 on axonal
infiltration into the glial scar and scaffold-filled lesion was analyzed
using the anterograde tracer BDA. Although BDA+ axons were
not located within the scaffold-filled lesion, in the treatment
conditions axons were present within the glial scar, in the
inhibitory CSPG-rich regions, which was significantly increased
from the untreated and agarose controls. The Rho GTPases, as
well as BDNF, influence actin cytoskeleton dynamics by aiding in
actin polymerization. These treatments may have reduced
retraction or altered dieback of axons in the treated conditions
to allow axons to extend toward the lesion site despite the presence
of the CSPG inhibitory regions. Rather than promote actin
polymerization, CA-Cdc42, CA-Rac1, and BDNF may have
hindered actin depolymerization reducing the amount of axonal
retraction. Therefore, the axons in the treated groups remained
closer to the lesion site compared to the controls.
CSPG inhibitory regions, identified by the fluorescent intensity
of CS-56 were observed proximal to the glial scar in the spinal
cord at similar intensity values. When the astrocytes become
reactive after injury, these cells deposit CSPGs creating a glial scar.
The presence of the CSPG-rich inhibitory regions and the effects
of the Rho GTPases and BDNF on axonal growth proximal to the
lesion site, suggests that it is imperative to deliver therapeutics that
block inhibitory signals not only into the cavity, but also to areas
proximal to the lesion site, thereby increasing the number of axons
extending towards and possibly through the lesion site.
Quantification of GFAP, CS-56, BDA, and NF-160 stains
demonstrated a significant difference between the treatments and
the control groups. Treatment with CA-Cdc42, CA-Rac1, and
BDNF demonstrated NF-160+ axons through the hydrogel
scaffold, a reduction in GFAP and CS-56 fluorescent intensity,
thereby reducing astrocytes reactivity and CSPG deposition, and a
higher percentage of BDA+ axonal extension towards the lesion
site. This suggests that the Rho GTPases and BDNF may
influence the inflammatory response possibly affecting the
macrophage/microglia and astrocyte responses and neuronal
axonal extension. The double combination of CA-Cdc42/CA-
Rac1 or delivery of CA-Cdc2, CA-Rac1, and BDNF in
combination was not performed in this study due to cytotoxic
effects that were observed in the neurons when CA-Cdc42 and
CA-Rac1 were transduced together [17]. The NF-160+ and
CGRP+ axonal growth also demonstrates that local delivery of
Rho GTPases and BDNF promotes axonal infiltration through
CSPG-rich regions and into the lesion site filled with the hydrogel
substrate after SCI. These findings suggest that there exists a
significant potential for strategies aimed at modulating Rho
GTPases alone, and in combination with each other or BDNF to
overcome CSPG-mediated inhibition after SCI.
