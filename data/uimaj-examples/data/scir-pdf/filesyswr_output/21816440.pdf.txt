I/R groups. Kidney samples fromHBOD I/R group rats
revealedmarkedly reduced histological damage under
histopathological examination. The animals treated
with HBO showed significantly elevated heme
oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein and mRNA levels expres-
sion compared with I/R group (P< 0.05).
Conclusions. Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning
(HBO-PC) can protect renal I/R injury against oxida-
tive stress, and the up-regulation of HO-1 expression
esis of ischemia-reperfusion injury involves calcium
overload, generation of oxygen free radicals, activation
of the apoptosis gene, and the disorder of mitochondria
function. Oxygen free radicals are considered to be one
of the important factors involved in the pathophysiol-
ogy of ischemia-reperfusion. Thus, reducing the pro-
duction of oxygen free radicals in the kidney after
reperfusion may alleviate the I/R injury.
Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning induces toler-
ance against brain ischemia reperfusion injury by
up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes [4], and induces
ischemia tolerance in other organs including the spinal
cord [5], myocardium [6], and liver [7]. The HO-1 sys-
tem, the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme,

Objective. Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury
occurs in both native and transplanted kidneys. Hy-
perbaric oxygen (HBO) has been shown to prevent I/R
injury in different tissues. The aim of this study was
to evaluate the effect ofHBOon renal I/R injury in rats.
Materials and methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats
were randomly assigned to three groups. The sham
group (n [ 8) received right nephrectomy. The I/R
(n[ 8) and HBOD I/R groups (n[ 8) received 45 min
left renal ischemia followed by 24h of reperfusion after
right nephrectomy. The HBO D I/R group (n [ 8) re-
ceived 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmosphere absolute (ATA),
for 1 h at every 12 h interval for 2 d. Reperfusion was
performed 24 h later after the last HBO exposure.
Results. In HBO D I/R group, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) and creatinine levels decreased significantly
compared with the sham and I/R groups (P< 0.01). Ac-
tivities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased
in renal tissue in the HBOD I/R groups. The content ofe27plantation, acute renal arterial occlusion and

JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH: VOL. 170, NO. 2, OCTOBER 2011e272HBO Treatment Procedure
A special animal hyperbaric chamber was used for HBO-PC. The
HBO-PC procedure was conducted by consecutive four times of 1 h
HBO exposure (2.5 ATA, 100% O2) at an interval of 12 h. The sham
group was not exposed to HBO in order to determine the basal levels
of antioxidative enzymes. Before pressurization, 100% medical oxy-
gen was flushed through the chamber for 10 min to displace ambient
air. Oxygen pressure was then increased slowly and reached 2.5 ATA
in 5 min. The chamber was ventilated during HBO therapy to avoid
carbon dioxide accumulation. After 60 min at 2.5 ATA, the chamber
was decompressed to normal atmospheric pressure in 5min. Accumu-
lation of CO2 was prevented by using a small container with calcium
carbonate crystals. Chamber temperature was maintained in the
range 22–25C. No seizures were observed in any animals during
all HBO-PCprocedures. I/R group ratswere placed in the same rodentis one of themost critical cytoprotectivemechanisms ac-
tivated during cellular stress [8]. HO-1 protein overex-
pression protects the kidney from free radical-mediated
injury [9]. To induce the overexpression of HO-1 chem-
ically or physically is an effectivemethod for preventing
or treating I/R injury. Huang et al. [10]. found thatHBO
pretreatment significantly induced the expression of
HO-1 in lung injury. However, the effect of HBO pre-
treatment on HO-1 expression in the kidneys of rats ex-
periencing renal I/R injury remains unstudied. The aim
of the current study was to determine whether HBO
preconditioning could induce tolerance against on renal
I/R injury, and, if so, to identify the mechanism for the
tolerance induction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
A total of 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 225–250 g were
used in the present study, which was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. All experiments were performed
in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines (NIH
pub. no. 86-23, revised 1985). Before the experiments, the animals
were fed a standard rat chow, drank water ad libitum, and were
housed in metabolic cages under controlled temperature in 12-h
light/dark cycles for at least 1 wk. The rats were randomly assigned
to one of three groups. The sham group (n¼ 8) received right nephrec-
tomy. Animals in the I/R (n¼ 8) group received 45min left renal ische-
mia followed by 24 h of reperfusion after right nephrectomy. In the
HBO þ I/R (n ¼ 8) group, 1 h at every 12 h interval for pretreatment
with hyperbaric oxygen was performed for 2 d. I/R models were per-
formed 24 h later after the last HBO.
Surgical Procedure
All procedures were performed aseptically. The animals were anes-
thetized with a combination of ketamine hydrochloride (85 mg/kg)
and xylazine hydrochloride (15 mg/kg), and placed on a heating pad.
Laparotomy was performed through a midline incision. The right re-
nal artery and right ureter were ligated and right nephrectomy was
performed. The left renal pedicle was exposed and occluded with
a non-traumatic vascular clamp for 45 min (except for the sham
group) and left kidneys were reperfused for 24 h in the I/R and
HBO þ I/R groups. Twenty-four hours after the initiation of renal is-
chemia, rats were sacrificed under anesthesia, blood was drawn, andchamber for 1 h at 12 h interval for 2 d in room air without increased
pressure. All HBO-PC administrations were started at the same time
in the morning (08:00 AM) to prevent biological rhythm changes.
Analysis of Renal Function
Twenty-four hours after renal ischemia, blood was used to assess
renal function by measuring serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and
creatinine (Cr). The samples were analyzed on a COBAS Mira chem-
ical analyzer (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with commercial kits from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Histopathologic Evaluation
Four-micron-thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (HE). Samples were blindly analyzed by a pathologist who
determined the extent of kidney injury based on a technique outlined
by Erdogan et al. [11]. Briefly, 24 areas corresponding to the kidney
proximal tubules were graded for the degree of renal damage based
on each of the following parameters: tubular cell necrosis, cytoplasmic
vacuole formation, hemorrhage, and tubular dilatation. Specifically,
one whole deep coronal section was examined under the microscope
and graded according to the extent of damage, based on the percent-
age of involvement of the kidney.Higher scores representmore severe
damage, with maximum score being 4. [0, normal kidney; 1, minimal
damage (0%–5% injury); 2, mild damage (5%–25% injury); 3, moder-
ate damage (25%–75% injury); and 4, severe damage (75%–100% in-
jury)]. The mean score for each parameter was determined and
subjected to statistical analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
Kidney tissue sections (4-mm thick) were subjected to immunohisto-
chemical analyses. Sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated
through graded ethanol solutions, rinsed in PBS for 5 min, and im-
mersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min to block en-
dogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were then rinsed in PBS
for 5 min, blocked with 5% BSA at room temperature for 15 min,
then incubated with primary monoclonal antibody against HO-1
(1:100 dilution; Boster Biotechnology Ltd. Co., Wuhan, China) at
4C overnight. Rabbit IgG Isotype was used as the negative control.
The slides were then incubated with biotinylated mouse anti-rabbit
IgG secondary antibody (Maixin Biotechnology Ltd. Co., Fuzhou,
China). Finally, incubated with H2O2-DAB for 1 min. Sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin. The estimates were performed by
a blinded observer on coded sections (3 to 4 sections per kidney and
10 to 12 fields per section). The observer performed light microscopy
and scored semiquantitatively the quantity of HO-1 staining in the
whole section (0 ¼ none, 1 ¼ weak, 2 ¼ moderate, 3 ¼ strong).
Measurement of Antioxidant Enzyme Activity and
Malondialdehyde Content
Kidney MDA and SOD content were performed according to the
technical manual of the detection kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Biochemis-
try Co., Nanjing, China). Kidney tissue was homogenized in phos-
phate buffer (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min,
the MDA and SOD content in the supernatant were measured using
the corresponding kits. MDA content wasmeasured with thiobarbitu-
ric acid (TBA) reaction. The method was used to obtain a spectropho-
tometric measurement of the color produced during the reaction of
TBA with MDA at 532 nm; estimated MDA level was expressed as
nmol/mg-protein. SODactivitywasmeasured using nitroblue tetrazo-
lium (NBT) reduction assay following the reduction of nitrite by a
xanthine-xanthine oxidase system, which is a superoxide anion
generator. One unit of SOD is defined as the amount that shows
50% inhibition.
The mRNA levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR methods.

tracted from tissues using a total RNA purification kit (Shenergy Bio-
color BioScience and Technology Co., Shanghai, China) according to
themanufacturer’s instructions. The purity and concentration of total
RNA was measured by spectrophotometer. With the first strand
cDNA synthetic kit (Fermantas, Vilnius, Lithuania) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, 2 mg total RNA was reverse tran-
scribed to cDNA. All PCRs were performed in the LightCycler (Roche,
Switzerland) with a final volume of 25 mL. Optimum conditions were
obtained with 2.5 mL buffer, 1.5 mLMgCl2, 0.5 mL dNTPs, 0.25 mL Taq
DNA polymerase, 0.1 mL of specific sense primer(s), 0.1 mL specific an-
tisense primer(s), 0.1 mL specific probe(s), and 2 mL template cDNA.
Finally, 17.95 mL ddH2O was added to the reaction mixture. The cy-
cling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95C for 3
min, followed by 40 cycles at 95C for 5 s and 60C for 12 s, collecting
the fluorescence signal at 40C. The standard substances for target
gene were performed using PCR with templates at the same time.
From each amplification plot, a threshold cycle (Ct) value (defined
as the number of PCR cycles where the fluorescence signal exceeded
the detection threshold value) was calculated while the number of
molecules of the genes was calculated. All samples were amplified
in duplicate and the average values were then exported to aMicrosoft
Excel for further analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 4.0
software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). All
data were expressed as mean 6 SD. Statistical analyses were made
using one-way ANOVA, followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls
(SNK) test for multiple comparisons. A P value <0.05 was considered
as statistically significance.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the effect of HBO on re-
nal I/R injury and demonstrated that HBO efficiently
suppressed I/R-induced renal dysfunction and tissue
injury. We used a two-day short term HBO-PC in this
study which is clinically feasible. Both renal function
tests and histopathologic scores were relatively better
in hyperbaric oxygen group. We found that this short
term HBO-PC protocol decreased the content of MDA,
and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes.
Moreover, renal tissues HO-1 protein and mRNA levels
were increased in rats treated with HBO.
In our experiment, repeated HBO-PC induced an in-
crease in the activity of SOD in the kidney and there
was significant difference between theHBOþ I/R group
and I/Rgroupat 24hafter I/R injury. Inmammals, three
isoforms of SODs are known: cytosolic copper-zinc SOD,
mitochondrial manganese SOD (Mn-SOD), and extra-
cellular SOD, which are products of distinct genes but
catalyze the same reaction. Among themMn-SOD local-
izes inmitochondria and is considered to be a first line of

that the 50-flank region of the Mn-SOD gene contains
a putative binding site for NF-kB, which is activated
by ROS and this suggests that Mn-SOD expression
can be regulated by ROS through NF-kB [13]. Even
though we measured total SOD activity, it is likely
Mn-SOD is involved in HBO-PC.
Although the precise mechanisms of renal injury
caused by ischemia-reperfusion have not been defined.

group and the I/R group. These data indicated that
HBO against renal I/R could have a relationship with
decreased lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative stress.
One of the possible explanations is that elevated activ-
ities of CAT and SOD scavenged excessive ROS and at-
tenuated the lipid peroxidation.
The IARF injury is thought to be due to ROS gener-
ated by reperfusion, which has been suggested to be
a result of the rapid release of heme from microsomal
cytochrome P450 [15]. Yogaratnam et al. [16] found
that bothHO-1mRNA and its enzyme activity were sig-
nificantly increased in the reversible IARF model . Up-
regulation of HO-1 confered increased resistance
against oxidative threat [17–20]. Inhibition ofHO activ-
ity by Sn-MP resulted both in a marked increase in
intracellular heme content and the aggravation of renal
function in this model. HO-1 induction thus played an
important role in the protection against renal dysfunc-
tion due to oxidative damages caused by heme. Using
a cultured lens epithelium model, Padgaonkar et al.
[21] showed that HBO induced HO-1 expression.
Rothfuss et al. [22] further indicated that HBO in-
creased the level of HO-1 in human lymphocytes consis-
tent with previous studies. We found that both HO-1FIG. 4. The mRNA levels of HO-1 in the kidney at the end of 24 h

ent, *P < 0.05, versus I/R group; **P > 0.05, versus sham group.mRNA and protein levels in the kidney of the HBOþ
I/R group were significantly enhanced after exposure
to HBO. The mechanism by which HO-1 exerts its ben-
eficial effects via several mechanisms. Increased HO-1
activity results in degradation of the heme moiety,
which is a pro-oxidant and potentially toxic to several
cellular targets, including lipid bilayers, mitochondria,
cytoskeleton, and components of the nucleus [23, 24]. In
addition to detoxifying heme, elevated HO-1 activity
results in the increased generation of bilirubin, an
antioxidant capable of scavenging peroxy radicals and
inhibiting lipid peroxidation [25]. Finally, HO-1 gener-
ates CO gas as a byproduct of the breakdown of heme.
Several studies have demonstrated the protective role
of CO itself in limiting renal damage in ischemia-
induced acute kidney injury [26, 27].
The results also demonstrated that insufficient HO-1
expressed in the I/R group was not able to prevent the
injury, presenting with the compromised renal func-
tions and kidney oxidative injuries. While theHBOpre-
conditioning induced significant HO-1 expression after
the kidney ischemia and reperfusion with less kidney
injuries and better kidney functions, which provided
experimental evidence for renal ischemia and reperfu-
sion injury prevention and treatment.

exists during which the tissue is vulnerable to reperfu-
sion injury. Reperfusion leads to complete recovery be-
fore this critical window. However, if it is exceeded
reperfusion leads to no recovery [28]. Some investiga-
tors have speculated that the altered microcirculatory
environment after HBO therapy changed the response
to ischemia-reperfusion by inactivating radical genera-
tion in parenchymal cells and endothelium [29, 30].
HBO-induced oxidative effects depend not only on ther-
apeutic time windows but also on the exposure protocol.
The salvage rate has been 100% if HBO treatment was
initiated within 24 h of ischemia, compared with 0%
when treatment was delayed 72 h after ischemia-
induced skeletal muscle injury [31]. Another study
ture compared with other techniques such as ischemia

In conclusion, HBO preconditioning has a protective
effect on I/R by reducing the free oxygen radical perox-
idation of lipid membranes, and increasing the activity
of antioxidative enzymes. The up-regulation of HO-1
expression plays an essential role in HBO induced pre-
conditioning effect.

was performed at 24 h before renal ischemic. However,

cal practice. In nephrolithotomy, nephron-sparing sur-
gery for renal tumor and living donor nephrectomy,
ischemia reperfusion injury could lead to ARF. Some
patients could develop into end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) gradually after the surgery. HBO precondition-
ing has been proved to be able to induce ischemia toler-
ance, which ushers in a new way of prevent renal
ischemia injury. Due to the mild toxicity, side effects
and easy acceptability, HBO has a more promising fu-9. Shimizu H, Takahashi T, Suzuki T, et al. Protective effect of
