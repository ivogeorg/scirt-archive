Abstract
The L1 cell adhesion molecule promotes neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival in homophilic and heterophilic
interactions and enhances neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival homophilically, i.e. by self binding. We investigated
whether exploitation of homophilic and possibly also heterophilic mechanisms of neural stem cells overexpressing the full-
length transmembrane L1 and a secreted trimer engineered to express its extracellular domain would be more beneficial for
functional recovery of the compression injured spinal cord of adult mice than stem cells overexpressing only full-length L1
or the parental, non-engineered cells. Here we report that stem cells expressing trimeric and full-length L1 are indeed more
efficient in promoting locomotor recovery when compared to stem cells overexpressing only full-length L1 or the parental
stem cells. The trimer expressing stem cells were also more efficient in reducing glial scar volume and expression of
chondroitin sulfates and the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2. They were also more efficient in enhancing regrowth/
sprouting and/or preservation of serotonergic axons, and remyelination and/or myelin sparing. Moreover, degeneration/
dying back of corticospinal cord axons was prevented more by the trimer expressing stem cells. These results encourage the
view that stem cells engineered to drive the beneficial functions of L1 via homophilic and heterophilic interactions are
functionally optimized and may thus be of therapeutic value.

Introduction
The adhesion molecule L1 has been shown to favour conducive
processes in a generally inhibitory environment [1,2,3]. L1 is a
member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and promotes neurite
outgrowth in a homophilic (i. e. self-binding) manner [4]. In vitro
and in vivo studies support the view that homophilic interactions of
L1 not only promote neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration,
but also neuronal survival [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Furthermore, L1 is
involved in modification of synaptic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo
as well as in learning and memory [11,12]. L1 also promotes
myelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems
[13,14,15,16], and thus adds to functional recovery after lesioned
axons have re-grown. L1 also acts via heterophilic binding
mechanisms [17,18,19,20,21,22].
In previous studies, it has been shown that soluble, recombi-
nantly expressed dimeric L1 containing the extracellular domain
of the molecule in fusion with the Fc portion of human
immunoglobulin (L1-Fc) promotes locomotor recovery in adult
rats after contusion spinal cord injury [2,15]. Furthermore, retinal
ganglion cell axons regrow in an L1-Fc conducive environment
after optic nerve transection [3,16]. Embryonic stem cells
transfected to overexpress full-length L1 at the cell surface support
regrowth and reduce dying-back of corticospinal tract axons after
spinal cord injury in adult mice, in addition to enhancing survival
of L1 overexpressing stem cells versus non-overexpressing stem
cells [23]. Enhanced functional recovery and regrowth of
serotonergic axons from the brain, reduced dying-back of
corticospinal tract axons, reduced expression of the neurite
outgrowth inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan glycan
NG2, and reduced expression of the astrogliosis driven increase
of glial fibrillary acidic protein were observed [1]. Furthermore,
L1-mediated changes in signal transduction pathways of regrowing
axons and/or cells resident in the lesioned spinal cord showed a
pronounced influence of L1 on growth-related molecules [24].
The combined results have encouraged further use of L1 in lesion
paradigms, not only relating to spinal cord injury, but also in other
types of central nervous system trauma [23,25,26,27] and
peripheral nerve injury [28].
Given the potential of L1 to be of therapeutic value in nervous
system diseases and that its homophilic interactions are conducive,
it deemed important to improve L1’s efficacy in injuries of the
central nervous system. We hypothesized that secretion of a trimer
presenting its extracellular domain by stem cells constitutively
overexpressing full-length L1 at the cell surface under the control
of a universal promoter would enhance regeneration after spinal
cord injury even more so than the L1 overexpressing cells. A
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e46223
trimer of the extracellular domain of L1 was constructed for
expression with the aim to enhance L1’s capacity to cluster cell
surface expressed full-length L1 via homophilic interactions, thus
inducing signal transduction events conducive to neurite out-
growth and neuronal survival and conditioning the cellular
environment of the injured host spinal cord to enrich the hostile
host tissue with a regeneration-conducive adhesion molecule. Here
we report that the thus engineered stem cells are more potent in
recovery of locomotor functions than the parental cells not
expressing L1 or overexpressing full-length L1.
Materials and Methods
Generation and characterization of embryonic stem cells
stably secreting the trimerized extracellular domain of L1
The construct p901-L1-ccCMP-His6 was generated using
pECE L1-ccCMP-His6 as a template which was kindly provided
by Dr. Heike Hall (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zuerich).
In this construct, the mouse L1 extracellular domain (amino acid
residues 1 to 1,131) is connected at the carboxy-terminus with a
sequence encoding the cartilage matrix protein’s (CMP’s) coiled-
coil domain (CMPcc) to generate L1 homotrimers by covalently
assembling the CMPcc domains [29]. Considering the necessity of
antibiotic selection after transfection into the parent embryonic
stem cell (ESC) line overexpressing full-length L1, which was
constructed with neomycin resistance, the trimer encoding
sequence was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo vector by PCR
for zoecin antibiotic selection. The phosphoglycerokinase (PGK)
promoter was also introduced. Sequence identity of the construct
and secretion of L1 trimer was confirmed by DNA sequencing and
transfection of CHO cells followed by Western blot analysis of the
culture medium collected as the supernatant of the transfected cells
two days after subculture. ESCs constitutively expressing full-
length L1 [30] were then transfected with this construct and two
stable ESC lines were established. The ESC line, the ESC line
overexpressing full-length L1 and the ESC cell line overexpressing
full-length L1 and secreting the L1 trimer (hereafter designated wt
ESCs, L1 ESCs and tL1 ESCs, respectively) were subjected in
vitro to the same neural lineage differentiation protocol [31] to
generate neural stem cells (NSCs). More than 95% of these cells
were positive for nestin as described [25].
To verify secretion of the trimer in full-length L1 overexpressing
ESCs two stably transfected ESC lines were maintained for eight
days in culture and the supernatants and cell lysates were
collected, dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and
150 mM NaCl, and concentrated ,10-fold in an Amicon Ultra
centrifugation filter device (Millipore, Jaffrey, NH). Samples were
subjected to 7.5% reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE and
probed for by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody
against full-length mouse L1, kindly provided by Dr. Martin
Grumet (Rutgers University). Protein was determined by BCA
protein concentration assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rock-
ford, IL).
Animal surgery and cell transplantation
Female C57BL/6J mice, 3 months old, were deeply anaesthe-
tized by intraperitoneal injections of ketamine and xylazine
(100 mg of Ketanest and 5 mg of Rompun per kg body weight).
Surgery was performed as described [1]. In brief, laminectomy
was performed at the T7–T9 level and the spinal cord was lesioned
using a compression device which controls compression force
(degree of closure of the forceps) and duration of compression. The
spinal cord was maximally compressed (100%, according to the
operational definition of Curtis and colleagues [32,33]) for 1 s by a
time-controlled current flow through the device. One ml of tL1, L1
and wt NSCs (16105 cells in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3
(PBS)) was injected 0.5 mm both rostral and caudal to the lesion
site using a glass micropipette (tip diameter 100 mm) 1 mm deep
into the spinal cord [23]. The locomotor behavior was assessed
weekly after the injury until six weeks. Mice were then sacrificed
for histological and biochemical analyses in a blinded manner. All
surgical procedures and post-operative care were approved by the
Rutgers University Animal Care Committee (permit number:
95051) following the guidelines of the National Institutes of
Health.
Evaluation of locomotor behavior
Ground locomotion was evaluated every week from 1 week to 6
weeks after injury using the Basso Mouse Score (BMS) rating scale
[34]. Twelve mice evaluated for locomotor activity before surgery
were randomly assigned to each group that received an intraspinal
injection of tL1, L1, wt NSCs, or PBS only. In addition to BMS
assessment, locomotor recovery was analyzed using a single-frame
motion analysis including evaluation of three parameters in two
different tests: a beam walking test (foot-stepping angle and rump-
height index) and a test for voluntary movements without body
weight support (extension–flexion ratio) [35]. In addition to
analyzing the values for these parameters, recovery indices were
calculated [35]. The recovery index (RI) is an individual animal
estimate for any given parameter described above and is calculated
in percent as: RI= [(X7+n2X7)/(X02X7)]6100, where X0, X7
and X7+n are experimental values prior to injury, 7 days after
injury, and a time-point n days after injury, respectively. Values
for the left and right extremities were averaged. Only animals that
showed a foot-stepping angle of 160u or more 7 days after injury
were considered severely lesioned. All other animals were excluded
from further analysis. One animal each was excluded from the tL1
NSC group and PBS vehicle only group, respectively.
Animal perfusion and immunocytochemistry
Animals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine and xylazine (100 mg of Ketanest and 5 mg of Rompun
per kg body weight) and perfused transcardially with cold
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (0.1 M) followed by 4% paraformalde-
hyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. A 3 cm long tissue piece of the
spinal cord centered at the lesion site was dissected out and
processed for the different types of analysis as follows.
For cryotomy, the spinal cords were post-fixed in the perfusion
solution plus 10% sucrose overnight at 4uC, and then cryopro-
tected in 20% sucrose in PBS for 48 h at 4uC. Then, the spinal
cord centered at the lesion site was dissected and embedded in
mounting media (HistoPrep, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) on
dry ice. Cryostat sections (30 mm thick) were cut and stored at
270uC.
For immunohistochemistry, sections were permeabilized with
0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature.
Non-specific adsorption was minimized by incubating the sections
in 2% (v/v) normal goat serum in PBS for 20 min at room
temperature. Sections were incubated in the blocking solution with
primary antibody at 4uC overnight. For control, non-immune
mouse IgM and IgG as well as rabbit IgG were used as primary
antibodies. Slides were washed three times with PBS and
incubated with Alexa 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or
Alexa 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800, Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 2 h at room temperature.
Sections were then washed with PBS, and some sections were
incubated with 49-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min-
utes, rewashed with PBS, mounted with Aqua Poly/Mount

medium (Polysciences, Warrington, PA), and imaged with an
Axiovert200 Fluorescence Live Cell Imaging Workstation (Zeiss).
Control sections did not yield detectable signals.
Estimation of lesion volume
Lesion volume was estimated in parasagittal sections spaced
200 mm apart and stained with polyclonal antibodies against
GFAP (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and fibronectin (1:500,
Sigma) to estimate the scar volume using the Cavalieri principle.
Quantification of serotonergic axons
Parasagittal sections were double-immunostained for serotonin
(5-HT) (1:400, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and fibronectin (1:500,
Sigma, St. Louis, MI) to determine 5-HT+ fibers which had
sprouted/regrown into lesion site and caudal beyond the
fibronectin-immunostained lesion site 6 weeks after the injury. 5-
HT+ fibers were imaged with the Axiovert 200 Fluorescence Live
Cell Imaging Workstation (Zeiss) and quantified by AxioVision
software (Zeiss). Background intensity from an area with no 5-HT
immunoreactivity was subtracted from the intensity value. The
values are presented as the area of 5-HT+ fibers from 2 mm
rostral to the lesion site and the % ratio of fluorescence measured
1 mm caudal to the lesion over the background immunofluores-
cence measured rostral (1 mm) to the lesion site, respectively.
Quantification of axon density in the corticospinal tract
For the assessment of axons in the corticospinal tract (CST) by
PKC-c immunostaining, free-floating cross-sections (50 mm thick)
were blocked and then incubated with anti-PKC-c antibody
(1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at
4uC. After washes in PBS, the sections were incubated with
fluorescent Alexa 555 goat-anti mouse secondary antibody (1:800,
Invitrogen). Images were taken of the dorsal spinal cord columns
at 106magnification using Axiovert 200 Fluorescence Live Cell
Imaging Workstation (Zeiss) at 3, 6, 9, and 11 mm rostral to the
injury center. Using ImageJ Software (NIH), the relative intensity
of PKC-c immunoreactivity was measured in a traced area within
the dorsal columns. Background intensity from an area with no
PKC-c immunoreactivity was subtracted from the intensity value.
Automatic thresholding for each image using ImageJ software was
performed to determine the threshold for specific immunoreac-
tivity. After setting the threshold, the immunostaining intensities
above the threshold were quantified.
Western blot analysis
Spinal cords were dissected, placed in ice-cold artificial CSF
(124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM NaHPO4, 26 mM NaHCO3,
1.5 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM glucose pH 7.0),
and cleaned from meninges and nerve roots. A 1 cm long tissue
piece of the cord centered at the lesion site was dissected and
homogenized (in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1%
SDS, 100 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and
100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For slot blotting, 100 mg
of total protein/well was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes using a Bio-Dot slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). The membranes were then incubated with rat
L1 monoclonal antibody (555) (1:5000, R&D Systems, Minneap-
olis, MN), mouse monoclonal chondroitin sulfate antibody (CS56)
(1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), mouse monoclonal NG2
antibody (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit polyclonal glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO), rat monoclonal myelin basic protein antibody
(1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal neurofila-
ment H (NF200) antibody (1:500 Millipore, Temecula, CA),
mouse monoclonal beta-III tubulin antibody (1:1000, Covance,
Emeryville, CA), rabbit polyclonal numb antibody (1:50, devel-
oped by Dr. Catherine Saner and obtained from the Develop-
mental Studies Hybridroma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City,
IA) and mouse monoclonal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-
genase (GAPDH) antibody (1:5000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA).
Secondary mouse, rat or rabbit antibodies conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase with ECL illuminescence intensification
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) were used for detection.
The grey value of each band was measured and normalized to the
grey value of the corresponding GAPDH band using Gel-Pro
Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD).
Statistical analysis
All numerical data are presented as group mean values with
standard error of mean (SEM). Statistical analyses for locomotor
behavior were performed by one-way repeated-measures ANOVA
comparing groups followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. The statistical
significance of differences for mean immunoreactivity intensities,
grey values of bands in Western blots and ELISA for each group
was estimated by analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA), followed
by Tukey’s post-hoc test. The p-values,0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Identification of secreted trimeric L1 in stably transfected
embryonic stem cells
Western blot analysis was performed to test L1 as full-length
transmembrane molecule and as secreted trimer in cultured
embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The expression and secretion of the
trimeric L1 was observed in the cell lysate and supernatant of a
stably transfected ESC line overexpressing trimeric L1 (tL1) with
an apparent molecular mass of 380 kD in SDS-PAGE under non-
reducing conditions (Fig. 1A, B). The results indicate that the
trimeric L1 is secreted.
tL1 NSCs improve locomotor function better than L1
NSCs and wt NSCs after transplantation into the lesioned
spinal cord
Spinal cord compression injury caused severe locomotor
disabilities in all four experimental groups as estimated by the
Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) score one week after injury (Fig. 2A).
Between 3 and 6 weeks after injury, mice transplanted with tL1
NSCs showed increased mean BMS score values when compared
to the other groups transplanted with L1 NSCs at 5 and 6 weeks
(p,0.01) or wt NSCs at 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks (p,0.01) at the
different time points indicating superior locomotor recovery with
the maximal mean score values being 5.160.16 at 5 weeks
(Fig. 2a).
We also analyzed the plantar stepping ability of the animals by
measuring the foot-stepping angle which was in agreement with
the BMS scores. Superior locomotor recovery was observed in
mice transplanted with tL1 NSCs when compared to the mice
transplanted with L1 NSCs at 6 weeks (p,0.01) or wt NSCs at 3
weeks (p,0.05) and at 6 weeks (p,0.01) (Fig. 2B, E). As the foot-
stepping angle is a measure of involuntary movement rather than
of more complex motor functions, the rump-height index, a
parameter to estimate the ability to support body weight during
ground locomotion, was analyzed (Figs. 2C,F). The results show
that mice transplanted with tL1 NSCs had a higher rump-height
index and smaller foot-stepping angle than the mice transplanted

with L1 NSCs at 6 weeks (p,0.05) or wt NSCs at 3 weeks (p,0.05)
and at 6 weeks (p,0.01) (Fig. 2C, F). Moreover, the extension-
flexion ratio, a parameter to judge voluntary movements without
body weight support, showed improvement in the mice trans-
planted with tL1 NSCs when compared to mice transplanted with
wt NSCs at 3 and 6 weeks (p,0.05). No differences were observed
between the mice transplanted with tL1 NSCs or L1 NSCs,
although the former showed a tendency towards improved motor
function than the latter three and six weeks after injury (Fig. 2D,
G). Based on two independent measures, these results indicate that
transplantation with tL1 NSCs improves the abilities for ground
locomotion after spinal cord injury. A good association between

the BMS score and the foot-stepping angle has been described
previously [1,26,35]. Overall recovery indices for each animal
revealed a better overall outcome in mice transplanted with tL1
NSCs compared to mice transplanted with L1 NSCs (p,0.01) or
wt NSCs (p,0.01) at six weeks after transplantation (Fig. 2H).
tL1 NSCs reduce the lesion volume
Six weeks after transplantation, the lesion area was compared
between mice transplanted with tL1 NSCs, L1 NSCs or wt NSCs
(Fig. 3). Mice grafted with tL1 NSCs showed a reduced lesion
volume when compared to mice grafted with wt NSCs (p,0.01)
and showed a slightly, although not significantly reduced lesion
volume in comparison with mice grafted with L1 NSCs (Fig. 3).
tL1 NSC transplantation promotes regrowth/sprouting of
serotonergic (5-HT+) axons into and across the lesion site
5-HT immunoreactive fibers were quantified in the areas 2 mm
rostral to the lesion site in parasagittal sections. The results showed
higher values in mice grafted with tL1 NSCs in comparison to
mice grafted with L1 NSCs (p,0.05) or wt NSCs (p,0.01)
(Fig. 4F). It was further examined whether 5-HT+ fibers entered
the lesion site and passed beyond the site which was demarcated
by fibronectin immunolabeling (Fig. 4). 5-HT+ profiles at the
caudal border of the fibronectin-immunoreactive lesion site were
observed in five out of six mice grafted with tL1 NSCs (Fig. 4C,
E), only in three out of six mice grafted with L1 NSCs (Fig. 4B,
D), but none in an animal grafted with wt NSCs (Fig. 4A).
Quantification of 5-HT+ fibers that had penetrated beyond the
caudal border of the lesion site, expressed as a % ratio of the 5-
HT+ immunofluorescence intensity measured caudally to the
lesion over the fluorescence measured rostrally (1 mm). The ratio
showed a difference in mice grafted with tL1 NSCs when

protein (GFAP) expressing astrocytes (red) six weeks after transplantation of tL1, L1 or wt NSCs. Five mice per group were analyzed. Shown are mean
values with SEM from Image J. The scar volume in the wt NSC group was set to 100%. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s post-hoc test (** p,0.01). Scale bar = 150 mm.

compared to the mice grafted with L1 NSCs (p,0.01) or the mice
grafted with wt NSCs (p,0.01) (Fig. 4G).
tL1 NSCs prevent demyelination and/or promote
remyelination after spinal cord injury
To monitor the de-/remyelination resulting from tL1 NSCs
transplantion, Luxol Fast Blue staining was performed on cross-
sections. Mice transplanted with tL1 NSCs showed larger
myelinated areas at the lesion site and 1 or 2 mm rostral and
caudal to the lesion site, when compared to the group of mice
transplanted with L1 NSCs or wt NSCs (Fig. 5A, B). Also more
neurofilament immunoreactive fibers were myelinated in the area
rostral to the epicenter of the injury, as shown by colocalization
with staining of myelin basic protein (MBP) in mice transplanted
with tL1 NSCs (Fig. 5C). Quantitative evaluation of MBP
expression by Western blot analysis showed that expression of the
two larger MBP isoforms (21.5 kDa and 18.5 kDa) was upregu-
lated in mice grafted with tL1 NSCs, when compared to mice
grafted with L1 NSCs (p,0.05 for 21.5 kDa) and (p,0.01 for
18 kDa) or wt NSCs (p,0.01 for 21.5 kDa and 18 kDa) (Fig. 5D,
E). No differences between the groups were found for the other
MBP isoforms (17.0 and 14.0 kDa) (Fig. 5D). Both, Luxol Fast
Blue staining and MBP expression indicate that tL1 NSCs prevent
demyelination and/or promote remyelination.
tL1 NSCs promote axonal preservation and/or regrowth/
sprouting of corticospinal tract axons after injury
To investigate whether grafting of tL1 NSCs would promote
axonal sparing and/or regrowth/sprouting, the integrity of the
corticospinal tract (CST) was analyzed. Axons caudal to the lesion
site were observed to undergo Wallerian degeneration, whereas
axons in the rostral segment were observed to undergo retrograde

immunohistology in the areas 2 mm rostral to the lesion site and beyond the caudal border of the lesion site (indicated by fibronectin (FN)
immunostaining) in parasagittal sections of mice transplanted with tL1 (C, E) at 6 weeks after transplantation when compared to mice grafted with L1

axonal degeneration (‘‘dying back’’). Integrity of the CST was
assessed by immunostaining for PKC-c [36,37], which specifically
marks the main CST at the base of the dorsal columns of
uninjured mice (Fig. 6). No PKC-c immunoreactivity was
observed in the dorsal columns 3 mm caudal to the lesion site at
six weeks after injury. PKC-c immunostaining intensities were also
decreased at the base of the dorsal column at rostral distances
between 3 and 12 mm in parasagittal sections compared to the
uninjured spinal cord, suggesting axonal degeneration in the
rostral part of the CST (Fig. 6A–E). Injured CST fibers frequently
appeared swollen, indicating dystrophic, ‘‘dying back’’ axonal
terminals. All injured mice showed a reduction in intensity of the
PKC-c immunostaining rostral to the lesion in comparison to the
uninjured animals (Fig. 6A–F). This reduction was more
pronounced in mice grafted with wt NSCs or L1 NSCs than in
mice grafted with tL1 NSCs (Fig. 6E, F). Higher intensities of
immunostaining for PKC-c was seen rostral to the lesion site in
mice grafted with tL1 NSCs than in mice grafted with L1 NSCs at
3, 6 mm (p,0.01) and 9 mm (p,0.05) (Fig. 6D, F) or wt NSCs at
3, 6 and 9 mm (p,0.01) (Fig. 6C, F).
Western blot analysis of neurite outgrowth inhibitory
and beneficial molecules
Western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions identified
tL1 in homogenates from 1 cm long spinal cord segments
containing the lesion site one week after transplantation with tL1
NSCs. The homogenates from these segments obtained 6 weeks
after the injury and NSCs transplantation were probed by Western
blot analysis using antibodies against chondroitin sulfate (ChS),
GFAP and the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) NG2.
Reduction in the levels of CSPGs, GFAP and NG2 expression was
observed in mice grafted with tL1 NSCs, when compared to mice
grafted with wt NSCs (p,0.01) (Fig. 7). Analysis of axon–related
molecules showed higher expression levels of both neurofilament
H and beta-III tubulin in mice grafted with tL1 NSCs, when
compared to mice grafted with L1 NSCs or wt NSCs (Fig. 7). The

expression levels of the cell fate determinant factor numb which
had been found to improve neurite outgrowth by promoting L1
endocytosis at growth cones [38] were higher in mice grafted with
tL1 NSCs than in mice grafted with wt NSCs (p,0.01).
Discussion
The present study was undertaken to probe the need for
improving the efficacy of the functions of L1 by engineering stem
cells to overexpress full-length L1 and, in addition, a secreting the
trimer of the extracellular domain of L1 in order to optimize not
only for the beneficial homophilic and also heterophilic interac-
tions benefitting the transplanted stem cells in a fashion that could
be perceived to act via ‘‘autocrine’’ mechanisms (L1 interacts with
itself in trans-interaction), but also to favourably condition the
hostile tissue environment in a ‘‘paracrine’’ fashion to tip the
balance towards regeneration-conducive cues. The hypothesis was
that stem cells with this configuration of L1 expression would not
only be stimulated in L1 signal transduction mechanisms leading
to a combination of beneficial events in the full-length L1
overexpressing stem cells triggered by the L1 trimer, but also lead
to diffusion of the trimeric L1 away from the engineered cells into
the host tissue and thus condition it rostral and distal to the lesion
site for tissue preservation and overcoming the inhibitory cellular
environment of the host, respectively. An example of this
conducive effect is that the transmembrane form of L1 is able to
overcome its inhibitory signaling complex with neuropilin-1 in
vitro by addition of L1-Fc [39].
Our study lends support to the view that we have optimized the
beneficial functions of L1 in neural stem cells. It is noteworthy in
this context that L1 not only interacts via homophilic mechanisms,
but has many ways of interacting in heterophilic modes, one of
which relates to its heterophilic cis-interactions resulting in neurite
outgrowth and homophilic trans-interactions which results in
neuronal survival, via distinct, but also more down-stream similar
signal transduction cascades [17]. Also the differentiation of neural
stem cells into neurons is enhanced by L1 in a trans-interaction

that are likely to involve homophilic and heterophilic interactions
in cis and trans [40]. A distinction between hemophilic and
heterophilic interaction mechanisms of the secreted L1 is not
possible in the complex molecular and cellular context of an
injured tissue.
We have shown previously that full-length L1 overexpressing
embryonic stem cells differentiated into the neural lineage are
able, without trimer expression, to promote murine corticospinal
tract axons regrowing into the lesion site of spinal cord and, in
some cases, extending beyond it one month after transplantation.
These results indicated that L1 expressed by stem cells may confer
beneficial properties to the stem cells themselves by presenting a
favorable substrate to the severed axons so that they would cross
the lesion site and lend to them trophic support [23]. Homophilic
interaction of these stem cells were most likely not optimal since
the adult host tissue expresses low levels of L1 which is most highly
expressed during ontogenetic development of the nervous system.
It is noteworthy in this respect that astrocytes and oligodendro-
cytes do not express detectable levels of L1, whereas the
regeneration-conducive Schwann cells express L1 when they de-
differentiate into proliferating Schwann cells and differentiate to
initiate L1-mediated remyelination after nerve transection caudal
to the lesion site of peripheral nerves, thus contributing to
successful regrowth and myelination of severed axons. Based on
these findings we engineered astrocytes - in addition to neurons -
to express L1 via adeno-associated viral transduction and found
that this manipulation enhanced spinal cord regeneration after
injury [1]. We have also infused L1 in the dimeric form of its
extracellular domain into the contusion-lesioned rat spinal cord
and observed enhanced functional recovery [2]. The interpreta-
tion of this result was that a diffusible L1 molecule conditions the
tissue environment such that it overcomes the inhibitory cues of
the host such that neuritogenesis is not compromised [41].
Based on these observations we sought to combine the
regeneration-promoting effect of transmembrane-anchored L1
with diffusible L1 to promote regeneration after injury. We
observed beneficial effects of this combination by assessment of
locomotor recovery using the BMS score and quantitative
evaluation of hind leg posture indices and, as observed previously
[1,26,35], found a good correlation between the BMS score and,
in particular, the foot-base angle as seen in video-recordings. The
locomotor parameters correlated with histological/immunohisto-
logical parameters as quantified by glial scar formation - being
reduced because of L1-mediated neuronal/axonal protection -
and the following parameters: enhanced density of serotonergic
fibers in and beyond the glial scar, sparing of axons of the

corticospinal tract rostral to the lesion site, and sparing of myelin
and/or enhancing remyelination. The size of glial scar was taken
into account, since it correlates positively with the extent of the
lesion and neuronal/axonal injury. The other parameters were
chosen as characteristic features of correlation between locomotor
recovery and cellular disposition. The corticospinal tract does not
contribute to locomotor recovery, when spinal cord lesions are
carried out at the thoracic level, but sparing of these axons is an
indicator of protective effects and was thus added to the
parameters measuring the influence of L1 in the injured host. It
is plausible to expect that other cellular parameters of successful
locomotor recovery would be beneficially influenced by the L1
overexpressing stem cells and by soluble L1, but since they have
been described before, they were not reiterated in the present
study. As in our previous studies, there were no indications that
animals suffered from allodynia or hyperalgesia, neither in the
mice transplanted with the parental NSCs nor in mice
transplanted with L1 NSCs or tL1 NSCs.
The results of the present study encourage the view that neural
stem cells can be used to optimize the beneficial functions of L1
and thus contribute to an improved amelioration of the behavioral
deficits after injury in the acutely lesioned spinal cord. Based on
our previous studies we hope that the optimized cells would also
ameliorate the deficits in mouse models of neurodegenerative
diseases, such as Huntington’s [25], Parkinson’s [26] and possibly
other nervous system diseases.
