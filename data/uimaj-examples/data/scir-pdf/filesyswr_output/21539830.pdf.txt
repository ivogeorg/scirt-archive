Introduction
In amniotes, such as birds andmammals, the ability to significantly
regenerate the central nervous system (CNS) is lost with develop-
ment. Comparative analysis of injury responses at permissive and
non-permissive stages of regeneration can therefore shed light on the
cellular and molecular basis underlying such loss. The chick spinal
cord provides an excellent model for these comparative studies, given
its accessibility in ovo and the fact that at non-regenerating stages of
The chick spinal cord displays remarkable regenerative ability,
even at rather advanced stages of development, but this is eventually
lost around embryonic day 13 (E13) (Ferretti and Whalley, 2008;
Hasan et al., 1991; Shimizu et al., 1990). The ability to regenerate the
spinal cord, as well as the loss of it with development, is most likely
due to a combination of several factors, including changes in early
response to injury (involving events occurring within hours rather
than days after injury), progression of myelination and possibly
intrinsic properties of neurons and of neural stem/progenitor cellsdevelopment it appears to respond to traum

Spinal cord regenerative ability is lost with development, but the mechanisms underlying this loss are still
poorly understood. In chick embryos, effective regeneration does not occur after E13, when spinal cord injury
induces extensive apoptotic response and tissue damage. As initial experiments showed that treatment with a
calcium chelator after spinal cord injury reduced apoptosis and cavitation, we hypothesized that
developmentally regulated mediators of calcium-dependent processes in secondary injury response may
contribute to loss of regenerative ability. To this purpose we screened for such changes in chick spinal cords at
stages of development permissive (E11) and non-permissive (E15) for regeneration. Among the
developmentally regulated calcium-dependent proteins identified was PAD3, a member of the peptidylargi-
nine deiminase (PAD) enzyme family that converts protein arginine residues to citrulline, a process known as
deimination or citrullination. This post-translational modification has not been previously associated with
response to injury. Following injury, PAD3 up-regulation was greater in spinal cords injured at E15 than at
E11. Consistent with these differences in gene expression, deimination was more extensive at the non-
regenerating stage, E15, both in the gray and white matter. As deimination paralleled the extent of apoptosis,
we investigated the effect of blocking PAD activity on cell death and deiminated-histone 3, one of the PAD
targets we identified by mass-spectrometry analysis of spinal cord deiminated proteins. Treatment with theatic injury in a similar

206 S. Lange et al. / Developmental Biology 355 (2011) 205–214stages of development, with the latter showing much more extensive
apoptosis and cavitation by 24 h after spinal cord injury (McBride
et al., 2003; Whalley et al., 2006). Changes in calcium homeostasis
following neural trauma play a critical role in the progression of
secondary injury in mammals, including triggering an apoptotic
response (Norberg et al., 2008; Orrenius et al., 2003; Velardo et al.,
2000; Wang et al., 1999). Therefore, we wished to assess whether
developmentally regulated calcium-dependent processes might also
play a role in the changes in secondary injury response, and con-
sequently in the regenerative ability of the chick spinal cord, and used
a microarray-based analysis to identify such genes.
Among differentially regulated calcium-dependent proteins, we
identified a member of the rather neglected calcium-dependent
protein peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family. Enzymes of the PAD
family, of which 5 members (PAD1–4 and PAD6) are known in
mammals and 3 (PAD 1–3) in chick, convert protein arginine residues
to citrulline (deimination/citrullination) (Balandraud et al., 2005;
Chavanas et al., 2004). It has been suggested that deimination plays a
role in a number of diseases including skin diseases, rheumatoid
arthritis and allergic encephalomyelitis (Cao et al., 1998; Doyle and
Mamula, 2005; Gyorgy et al., 2006; Mastronardi et al., 2006; Nicholas
et al., 2005; Raijmakers et al., 2006; Vossenaar et al., 2003;Wood et al.,
2008; Ying et al., 2009). Deimination is a post-translational modifi-
cation that leads to a charge loss that can alter protein conformation
and consequently their structure, function and interaction with other
proteins. We show here that PAD3 is developmentally regulated in
response to injury and that PAD inhibition results in a reduction in
apoptosis and cavitation, supporting a role for PAD and deimination in
modulating secondary injury response with development following
spinal cord damage. This study also points at PADs as potential ther-
apeutic targets.
Materials and methods
Animals, surgery and pharmacological treatments
Fertilized Brown Leghorn eggs (Needle Farm, Cambridge, UK)were
incubated at 37 °C in a humidified forced flow incubator. All pro-
cedures were approved under the Animals Scientific Procedures Act
1986. Surgery and tissue collection was carried out as previously
reported (Shimizu et al., 1990; Whalley et al., 2006).
Different concentrations of the Ca++ chelator BAPTA-AM solubi-
lized in DMSO or of the PAD inhibitor, Cl-amidine (Knuckley et al.,
2008; Luo et al., 2006), solubilized in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), or
of the carrier alone were applied in ovo immediately after spinal cord
injury at E15 and their effect on survival assessed at 24 h (Whalley
et al., 2006). Selected concentrations were tested for their effect on
apoptosis and deimination. The extent of cavity formation was
assessed in hematoxylin and eosin stained longitudinal spinal cord
sections and apoptosis detected by TUNEL as previously described
(Whalley et al., 2006). Briefly, montages of images of longitudinal
sections of spinal cord stained with H&E or TUNEL were created at a
level close to the center of the injury and the size of visible cavitation.
Tissue damage extending cranially and caudally from the site of injury
wasmeasured at 24 h using ImageJ; apoptosis was assessed by scoring
the density of apoptotic cells on a scale of 1–4 using the criteria
exemplified in Fig. 6F at different distances from the injury site (1, 2, 3,
4 mm). Statistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA and Student's
t-test and pb0.05 was taken to be significant.
RNA analysis
Total mRNA was extracted from the cervical peri-injury region or
the equivalent region from sham-operated embryos of five individual
spinal cords for each treatment group (E11 and E15 24 h post-surgery)
following the protocol of ARK genomics (www.ark-genomics.org/protocols). mRNA quality was checked using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
and mRNA expression assessed using chick GeneChip according to
manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). RNA (1 μg) from individual
spinal cordswas used to provide independent replicates for each array.
GeneSpring software (Agilent Technologies) was used for expression
analysis and filteringwas performed byVolcano plot (1.5 fold changes,
pb0.05) and verified using functional annotation clustering in David
6.7.
PAD3 and Gapdh gene expression was determined by quantitative
real time PCR (7500 Fast Real Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems)
using the SYBR GreenER reagent kit (Invitrogen) (Gögel et al., 2010).
Each sample was run in duplicate. Primers were designed to amplify
specific regions to the chickPAD3flanking region987–1123: PAD3chick
forward: 5′ CGTGAAGGACAATGAGGACT 3′; PAD3 chick reverse: 5′
GCACATAGCCAAACTCCACT3′. All results were normalized with respect
to Gapdh expression; GAPDH chick forward 5'CCAGGTTGTCTCCTGT-
GACT3′; GAPDH chick reverse 5'CACAACACGGTTGCTGTATC3′.
Protein analysis
Immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting were carried
out as previously described (Whalley et al., 2009). Sections were
imaged either under a Zeiss Axioplan or by confocal laser scanning
microscopy (LSM 710, Zeiss, Germany). Complete “z” series optical
sections were collected and projected onto a single plane using Zeiss
software and ImageJ. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions were
obtained by homogenizing pools of three cervical spinal cords in ice-
cold hypotonic buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
KCl, 0.5 mM DTT) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma). Lysis was achieved using QIAshredder spin columns
(QIAGEN) at 500 g. Cytoplasmic fractions were stored for further
analysis. Nuclear pellets resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold high salt
buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM
EDTA, 350 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT) containing protease inhibitors and
TritonX100 were kept on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at
13,000 g (30 min, 4 °C), supernatant containing nuclear proteins were
collected. Proteins (2–4 μg/lane) resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE were
analyzed by Western blotting.
A pool of 5 spinal cords per treatment group was used for immu-
noprecipitation of deiminated proteins, using the Catch and Release®
v2.0 Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate). An
identical amount of proteins (5 μg) from each treatment group pool
was immunoprecipitated. Immunoprecipitated protein fractions were
analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Candidate bands
were excised from silver stained gels, and analyzed by liquid chro-
matography electrospray tandemmass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS)
as previously described (Gögel et al., 2010).
Primary antibodies were: F95 monoclonal mouse IgM antibody
(Nicholas and Whitaker, 2002) (2 μg for immunoprecipitation; 1/200
for immunohistochemistry; 1/5000 for Western blotting); rabbit anti-
PAD3 (Chemicon, 1:200 for immunohistochemistry; 1:1000 for West-
ern blotting), mouse anti-NeuN (1:50, Millipore); rabbit anti-GFAP
(1:1000, Sigma); rat anti-MBP, and rabbit anti-deiminated histone 3
(citH3; 1:100 and 1:250, Abcam). Secondary antibodies were: HRP-
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Serotec, USA 1:2000), HRP-conjugat-
ed goat anti-rabbit (DAKO, 1:2000); Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-
mouse IgM and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:400;
Molecular Probes), Cy5-conjugated anti-rat (Invitrogen, 1:50).
Results
To establish whether inhibition of calcium influx at the time of
injury reduces injury response in E15 spinal cords, we administered
25 mg/kg of the calcium chelator BAPTA in ovo either in sham-
operated or injured embryos; this dose did not impair embryonic
survival, and slightly increased it (not shown). By 24 h after injury
207S. Lange et al. / Developmental Biology 355 (2011) 205–214E15 control embryos displayed an extensive apoptotic response, as
indicated by TUNEL, and significant tissue loss was already evident
(Fig. 1A). In contrast, in BAPTA-treated embryos little tissue damage
was observed and apoptotic cells were restricted to the region close
to the injury site (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, at 4 days after injury only
small cavities were observed and axonal tracts were present in the

molecules, PAD3 was expressed at higher levels at E15 than E11 and
also differently up-regulated in response to injury at these develop-
mental stages. Expression of PAD3 transcript in the spinal cord
increased six-fold after spinal cord injury at E15, but less than two-
fold after injury at E11 as compared to sham-operated controls
(Table 1). To confirm that the chick PAD identified in our screen was
homologous to mammalian PAD3, we designed primers specific for
chick PAD3 and assessed immunoreactivity using an anti-PAD3

in the chick spinal cord, increased significantly from E15 to E16 and
was greatly up-regulated after injury at E15 (Fig. 2A). As observed in
the microarray study, only a small PAD3 mRNA up-regulation was
observed in response to injury at E11 by qRT-PCR (not shown).
Expression of PAD3 proteinwas also assessed byWestern blotting and
immunohistochemistry. The anti-PAD3 antibody reacted with a chick
protein of molecular weight consistent with that of human PAD3
(Nachat et al., 2005) and reactivity was detected both in the nucleus
and in the cytoplasm, with a main band of approximately 70 kDa
being detected (Fig. 2B). Consistent with both nuclear and cytoplas-
mic localization of PAD3 was the identity of proteins immunopreci-
pitated by the PAD3 antibody identified by mass spectrometry, which
included histones and tubulin (Supplementary Table 1). Given the
high sequence similarity between PADs and the fact that both PAD2
and PAD3 are expressed in the spinal cord, we cannot fully rule out
that the antibody we used might to some extent react also with other
PADs. However, the difference in staining pattern observed with an-
tibodies to PAD3 and PAD2 (Fig. 2B), with the latter detecting a higher
molecular weight band, suggests specificity of the PAD3 staining
observed in the chick spinal cord. In spinal cord sections (Figs. 2C–G),
PAD3 reactivity in cells surrounding the central canal was mainly
nuclear (Figs. 2C and D) and appeared to be stronger at E12 (Fig. 2C)
than at E15 (Fig. 2F). At E11, PAD3 was also detected in a subset of
neurons, as indicated by co-labeling with the neuronal marker NeuN,
and in the white matter (Fig. 2E). At E15 PAD staining was still
observed in the gray matter and had increased in the white matter
(Fig. 2F). Double-staining for MBP and PAD3 showed PAD3 expression
immunohistochemical staining,Western blotting showed that protein
deimination was greatly increased in protein extracts from individual
sham-operated and injured E15 spinal cords, but not following injury
at E11 (Fig. 4).
Deiminationoccurred both in the injuredgray andwhitematter 24 h
after injury, as shown by double-staining with F95 and neural markers
(Figs. 5A–C). Notwithstanding the extensive tissue damage and the
rapid loss of NeuN reactivity observed following injury (Fig. 5A) that
couldmake precise co-localization difficult to assess, some cells double-
stained for F95 and neuronal (NeuN) or glial (GFAP,MBP)markerswere
detected, suggesting that deimination was activated in both lineages,
consistent with PAD3 expression (Figs. 2C, E, G, and 5D).
The more extensive deimination observed after injury at E15 than
at E11 paralleled the previously reported differences in apoptosis at
these developmental stages. Therefore, injured spinal cord sections
were double-labeled for deimination and TUNEL at different times
after injury. Some double-labeled cells were indeed observed in
injured spinal cords at 8 h (Supplementary Fig. 2A) and at 24 h after
surgery both at E11 and E15 (Figs. 5E and 6D). By 4 days after spinal
cord injury at E15, both apoptosis and F95 reactivity was greatly
reduced, but some hot spots of F95 reactivity were still observed in
clumps of tissue debris sometimes found within cavities, and some
double labeled-cells were still observed (Supplementary Figs. 2B and
C-C″). Consistent with a role in apoptosis, PAD3 expression could be
detected in several TUNEL-positive cells 24 h after injury, though it
was undetectable in very intensely labeled apoptotic cells, probably
due to its degradation at the late apoptotic stages (Fig. 5F).

tive cells, presumably astrocytes, were also observed in the white
matter (Fig. 2G).
To determine whether elevated PAD abundance resulted in in-
creased deimination activity, we used an antibody, F95, that spe-
cifically recognizes the citrulline in proteins (Nicholas et al., 2003). No
F95 reactivity was detectable in sham-operated spinal cords either at
E11 or E15 (Supplementary Figs. 1A and B). Following injury at E11
some F95 reactivity was detectable in the peri-injury region by 24 h
(Figs. 3A and B). In contrast, extensive deimination was observed
as early as 2 h after injury at E15 (Figs. 3C, D, D′). Consistent with

be detected at 2 h after injury, before apoptotic cells were detectable by
TUNEL, and was hardly visible in BAPTA-treated embryos (not shown),
consistent with deimination being a calcium-dependent process.
Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that PAD may play a role in
early injury response by treating E15 spinal cords with the PAD
inhibitor, Cl-amidine (80 mg/kg; Supplementary Table 2). Treatment
was performed immediately after injury and changes at the morpho-
logical level and in apoptosis were assessed 24 h later (Fig. 6). All
embryos treated with Cl-amidine displayed a significant reduction
in cavity size at 24 h after injury (Figs. 6A–C). Apoptosis was also

regulated following injury at E15, the Ca++-dependent transcripts
differently expressed in response to injury were up-regulated. Among
them, only annexin 1 displayed greater up-regulation after injury at
E11 than at E15. The precise role of annexins in neural injury remains
to be elucidated (Liu et al., 2004), but given suggestions that annexin 1
plays a neuroprotective role following cerebral ischaemia (Gavins et
al., 2007; Solito et al., 2008), its up-regulation in injured E11 spinal
cord may contribute to the high regenerative ability at this stage of
development. Significant up-regulation of members of the S100
family was observed in E15 injured spinal cords. The greater up-
regulation at E15 of calcyclin (S100A6), that has been associated with
astrogliosis (Lesniak et al., 2009; Yachnis et al., 1993; Yamashita et al.,
1999), may be due to the increase in astrocyte number with devel-
opment and consequently greater astrogliotic response following
injury. Altogether, the changes in the expression of Ca++-dependent
molecules revealed by our screen reflect the changes in apoptosis and
the degree of spinal cord damage occurring at the two developmental
stages studied, strengthening the view that early response to injury is
developmentally regulated and plays a crucial role in neural repair.
PAD and deimination modulate secondary injury response
PAD activity, resulting in protein deimination, has been recently
suggested to play a role in a number of autoimmune diseases, including
210 S. Lange et al. / Developmental Biology 355 (2011) 205–214significantly reduced in Cl-amidine treated embryos (Figs. 6D–F), as
observed following treatment with BAPTA (Fig. 1). Furthermore,
whereas NeuN staining was largely reduced at the injury site in
controls, its expression was still high in Cl-amidine treated injured
spinal cords (Figs. 6G-I). Reduction in apoptosis and tissue loss was
observed also when Cl-amidine was applied two hours after injury,
when up-regulation of deimination and tissue disruption is already
observed rather than at the time of injury (Figs. 7A–F).
We also examined the effect of Cl-amidine treatment on abun-
dance of deiminated histone 3 (CitH3) that was identified as a PAD
target by mass-spectrometry analysis of deiminated proteins immu-
noprecipitated by F95 (Fig. 8A) and also by the anti-PAD3 antibody
(Supplementary Table 1). Immunostaining for CitH3, was greatly
reduced in Cl-amidine-treated spinal cords as compared to untreated
controls (Figs. 8B–C).
Discussion
This study has identified PAD3 as a developmentally-regulated
enzyme, expressed both in progenitors and mature neural cells that
appears to be an important player in the early spinal cord injury
response and in modulating its severity.
Secondary injury in non-regenerating chick spinal cord is reduced by

Reduction in the secondary injury response is a first crucial step
towards improving repair within a damaged central nervous system.
It is well established that initial necrotic cell death induced by
mechanical injury is followed by more extensive tissue loss due to a
secondary injury response involving apoptotic neural cell death, both
in mammals and birds, and that its extent is related to functional
recovery (Basso et al., 1996; Beattie et al., 2000; Liu et al., 1997;
McBride et al., 2003; Whalley et al., 2006). The elevation in intra-
cellular free calcium levels following neural injury is known to play a
key role in this response in non-regenerating mammalian models. We

to that observed at stages of development permissive for regenera-
tion. Furthermore, reduced tissue loss and continuity of axons, though
somehow less well organized, is observed 4 days after spinal cord
crush in BAPTA-treated spinal cords. Whether this is due to axon
sparing or axon regeneration, or both, is currently not clear, and it will
require further investigation.
Ca++-dependent molecules are differently up-regulated following
neural injury at permissive and non-permissive stages for regeneration
Ca++ influx can affect several apoptosis associated molecules.

central nervous system(Chavanas et al., 2004;Doyle andMamula, 2005;
Gyorgy et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2007). All members of the PAD family
are expressed to some extent in the mammalian nervous system, with
theexceptionof PAD6 (also knownasePAD), thoughPAD2 is considered
to be the main brain PAD (Esposito et al., 2007; Keilhoff et al., 2008;
Shimada et al., 2010; Vossenaar et al., 2003). PAD4, like PAD2, has been
detected in myelin, and it has also been shown to translocate to the
nucleus where it can deiminate histones, while PAD3 expression was
found in Schwann cells and nuclei of some cultured cerebellar neurons
(Keilhoff et al., 2008; Mastronardi and Moscarello, 2005; Mastronardi
et al., 2006; Wood et al., 2008). Only 3 PAD genes, the homologues
of mammalian PAD1, 2 and 3, appear to be present in the chick
(Balandraud et al., 2005; Chavanas et al., 2004; Vossenaar et al., 2003).
Chick PAD3 protein shares a similar degree of amino acid identity with
humanPAD3andPAD4, 57%and55%, respectively.Wehave shownhere
that chick PAD3 is expressed in the spinal cord and its expression
increases between the regeneration-permissive and non-permissive
stages of development examined. PAD3 protein is detected both in
nucleus and cytoplasm, and identification of nuclear and cytoplasmic
targets by mass spectrometry analysis of PAD3-bound proteins is
consistent with PAD3 activity in both cell compartments. In addition to
its expression in the nervous system, PAD3, like its mammalian
counterpart (Chavanas et al., 2006), is strongly expressed in the skin
(not shown). Nuclear localization of PAD3 suggests similarities with
PAD4, which has been shown to deiminate histones (Cuthbert et al.,
2004; Wang et al., 2004, 2009). Altogether, chick PAD3 expression
appears to encompass some features of mammalian PAD2, 3 and PAD4,

cord; note that NeuN reactivity is maintained close to the injury site unlike in PBS controlsand it will be interesting to establish whether there is a correlation
between expansion of this gene family and the function of individual
members with evolution.
In the context of spinal cord repair in the chick, PAD3 mRNA is up-
regulated to a greater extent in response to injury at the non-
permissive stage for regeneration, and this is mirrored by increased
enzyme activity, as indicated by the extensive deimination observed
after injury at E15. Altogether, the regenerative ability of the spinal
cord appears to be associated with low levels and a later onset of
deimination, since in E11 injured cords, unlike in E15, deimination is
not detectable at two hours and is relatively low at 24 h. Additional
evidence for an early role of protein deimination in response to injury
comes from analysis of deimination in relation to the apoptotic
response previously reported in non-regenerating spinal cords
(McBride et al., 2003; Whalley et al., 2006). Apoptotic cells identified
by TUNEL are not yet detectable six hours after injury at E15, but the
injured region contains many TUNEL-positive cells by eight hours
(Whalley et al., 2006), while cells labeled for deimination are detected
several hours earlier. Although TUNEL is a relatively late marker of
apoptosis, these results suggest that up-regulation of deimination
represent an early response to spinal cord damage. This is also
consistent with in vitro experiments in which increase in intracellular
Ca++ following thapsigargin treatment of cultured neural cells was
found to induce a rapid increase in protein deimination (not shown).
Conversely, when intracellular Ca++ is decreased by BAPTA in injured
E15 spinal cords, neural damage is reduced, as reported in other injury
models (Tymianski et al., 1993). Significantly, the reduction in

212 S. Lange et al. / Developmental Biology 355 (2011) 205–214is comparable to that observed following BAPTA treatment. Impair-
ment of Ca++ homeostasis following injury is known to affect several
intracellular processes, including release of free radicals from mito-
chondria, leading to activation of a number of independent death
programs. It is therefore remarkable that PAD inhibition is able to
counteract much of this response. Indeed whereas the neuronal
marker, NeuN, rapidly disappears almost completely at the peri-injury
site in untreated spinal cords, it is still detectable in Cl-amidine
treated spinal cords. Altogether, our findings suggest that PAD3 is an
important mediator of Ca++-dependent damage both in neurons and
oligodendrocytes, where PAD3 is also detected. The large population
of mature oligodendrocytes and myelination present at E15 but not at
E11 is likely to contribute to the extensive tissue loss observed in E15
injured spinal cords (McBride et al., 2003). This together with the fact
that myelin-associated proteins are known PAD targets (Harauz and
Musse, 2007) suggests that oligodendrocyte sparing following PAD
inhibition may greatly contribute to reduced cavity size. The possible

in cavity size as indicated by boxed area. C-D) F95 labeling of injured control (C) and Cl-a
treated (F) spinal cords. Note that both deimination and apoptosis are greatly reducedinvolvement of deimination in astrocytic response is currently not
clear, as poor staining in injured spinal cord sections due to the
extensive tissue damage and the lack of suitable antibodies to double-
stain for GFAP and PAD3 did not allow extensive analysis of this cell
population.
We cannot rule out at this stage that other PADs may also play a
role in the calcium-dependent secondary injury response, as the
inhibitor used is not highly selective for PAD3. However, the dif-
ferential up-regulation of PAD3 in regenerating and non-regenerating
spinal cords is consistent with a crucial role for this PAD in the early
response to injury at least in the chick. While PADs have been im-
plicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, this to our
knowledge is the first evidence that they can be key mediators of
secondary injury response.
Given the limited repair ability of the CNS, the prospect of ad-
ministering pharmacologic agents shortly after injury to reduce cellular
and functional loss is very attractive. Several cellular processes arefinely
tuned by Ca++ levels, and disruption of Ca++ homeostasis occurs
within minutes after injury contributing to secondary injury response,
for example by activating apoptotic pathways and impairingmitochon-
drial function. In a clinical context, modulation of Ca++-dependent
effectors of neural damage that display prolonged activity following
spinal cord injury can represent a more viable and effective alternative
than modulation of Ca++ levels, that has not proven very successful in
clinical trials (Horn and Limburg, 2001; Szydlowska and Tymianski,2010). Indeed, both PAD mRNA levels and PAD activity are still much
higher in injured E15 spinal cords than in normal tissue several hours
after injury, when apoptosis is still occurring. The fact that administra-
tion of the PAD inhibitor after injury can still reduce tissue loss and
apoptosis suggests that there may be a window for intervention for
targeting PAD following spinal cord injury. This important issue will
require in depth evaluation.
Analysis of PAD targets can both provide valuable information on
mechanisms underlying changes in injury response with develop-
ment and help to identify additional potential targets for intervention.
Histone modifications are important modulators of several key
processes including cell death and survival. Significantly, PADs have
been recently proposed as regulators of other histone modifications
(Cuthbert et al., 2004; Denis et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2004). The fact that H3 is deiminated in response to spinal cord injury
and that reduction in H3 deimination following Cl-amidine treatment
parallels reduction in apoptosis suggests a possible epigenetic role for

that will deserve further investigation.
Conclusions
Developmentally regulated mediators of calcium-dependent pro-
cesses in secondary injury response may contribute to loss of
regenerative ability. In particular, this study has identified PAD3 as
one of these mediators in the developing spinal cord and highlighted
the importance of deimination in spinal cord injury response. Indeed,
post-translational modifications are emerging as key players in the
regulation of many cellular processes and we propose a role for
deimination in modulating the extent of injury-induced neural tissue
damage with development. Identification of this novel role for PAD
activity in spinal cord injury, together with the possibility of mod-
ulating it pharmacologically with a compound that appears to display
little toxicity in vivo (unlike calcium chelators), may open new
avenues to reducing tissue damage in injured spinal cords.
