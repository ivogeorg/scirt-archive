Following spinal trauma, the limitedphysiological axonal sprouting that contributes topartial recoveryof function isdependentupon the
intrinsic properties of neurons as well as the inhibitory glial environment. The transcription factor p53 is involved in DNA repair, cell
cycle, cell survival, and axonal outgrowth, suggesting p53 as key modifier of axonal and glial responses influencing functional recovery
following spinal injury. Indeed, in a spinal cord dorsal hemisection injury model, we observed a significant impairment in locomotor
recovery in p53/ versus wild-typemice. p53/ spinal cords showed an increased number of activatedmicroglia/macrophages and a
larger scar at the lesion site. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments suggested p53 as a direct regulator of microglia/macrophages
proliferation. At the axonal level, p53/ mice showed a more pronounced dieback of the corticospinal tract (CST) and a decreased
sprouting capacity of both CST and spinal serotoninergic fibers. In vivo expression of p53 in the sensorimotor cortex rescued and
enhanced the sproutingpotential of theCST inp53/mice,while, similarly, p53expression inp53/ culturedcorticalneurons rescued
a defect in neurite outgrowth, suggesting a direct role for p53 in regulating the intrinsic sprouting ability of CNS neurons. In conclusion,
we show that p53 plays an important regulatory role at both extrinsic and intrinsic levels affecting the recovery of motor function
following spinal cord injury. Therefore, we propose p53 as a novel potential multilevel therapeutic target for spinal cord injury.
Introduction
Following spinal cord trauma, there is a very limited potential for
axonal sprouting and regeneration as well as related functional
recovery due to the formation of a spinal glial inhibitory environ-
ment and to deficient intrinsic pro-regenerative properties of
neurons (Yiu andHe, 2006; Giger et al., 2008; Di Giovanni, 2009;
Liu et al., 2011). However, in the case of incomplete lesions of the
spinal cord, some physiological axonal sprouting and plasticity
that contribute to partial recovery of motor function does occur
(Raineteau and Schwab, 2001; Raineteau et al., 2002; Bareyre et
al., 2004). The identification of factors that play a role in both the
neuronal intrinsic and extrinsic spinal environment after lesion
may affect the proaxonal regenerative response and functional
recovery. Recently, we have shown that the transcription factor
p53 is required for axonal regeneration of the injured facial nerve
and for neurite outgrowth of cultured cortical and dorsal root
ganglia neurons (Di Giovanni et al., 2006; Tedeschi et al.,
2009a,b; Floriddia et al., 2011).
In mitotic cells and in cancer, p53 has been shown (1) to
negatively regulate cell proliferation through the transcriptional
regulation of cell cycle arrest genes, such as p21 (Liebermann et
al., 2007; Abbas andDutta, 2009), and (2) tomediate cell death in
highly damaged cells following a variety of stressors, including
oxidative stress, DNA damage, and growth factor deprivation
(Aloyz et al., 1998; Sakaguchi et al., 1998; Culmsee and Mattson,
2005).
Previous reports have suggested that p53 (Saito et al., 2000)
and p53-dependent signaling (Carmel et al., 2001; Di Gio-
vanni et al., 2003; Byrnes et al., 2006) are activated in both
neuronal and glial cells following spinal cord injury (SCI). In
addition, we previously found that p53-dependent target
genes, including DNA damage, cell cycle, and axonal plasticity-
related molecules are triggered mainly between 1 and 7 d
following injury (Di Giovanni et al., 2005a,b). Thus, we hy-
pothesize that p53 may be important for the regulation of
axonal sprouting in the injured spinal cord, for physiological
recovery of locomotion, as well as for the establishment of the
postinjury glial environment.

To this end, we performed a T10 bilateral dorsal hemisec-
tion of the spinal cord in wild-type (wt) and p53/ mice.
Strikingly, we found that physiological recovery of motor
function was impaired in p53/mice, which showed a more
pronounced dieback of the corticospinal tracts (CST) as well
as a clear impairment of serotoninergic (5-HT) and CST
sprouting. In addition, p53/mice displayed a larger fibrotic
scar and an increased number of activated microglia/macro-
phages at the lesion site, due to aberrant proliferation. More-
over, the impairment in CST sprouting in p53/ mice could
be rescued by p53 gain of function, supporting a direct role for
p53 in the modulation of the intrinsic neuronal response of
the CST.
Together, these data suggest that p53 affects the natural neu-
ronal and glial adaptive response to spinal injury that leads to
partial spontaneous recovery of motor function.
Materials andMethods
Mice
Mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Wild-type and
p53/, B6.129S2-Trp53 tm1Tyj/J (Jacks et al., 1994) mice used in this
study were male and strain matched. The age of the mice used for exper-
iments was 8 weeks. p53/ mice did not show any visible phenotype.
We did not observe any behavioral or learning difference compared with
wild type during the training for the behavioral assessments.
Surgical procedure and postoperative care
Mice were kept under anesthesia with 2% isoflurane/1% O2 mixture.
Body temperature was maintained by keeping the mice on a heating pad
(37°C) during the whole procedure. The skin over the thoracic area was
shaved and cleaned three times with Softasep N (Braun). The skin was
incised, the superficial fat shifted apart, and themuscle tissue dissected to
expose laminae T9–T11. A T10 laminectomy was performed, the dura
materwas removed, taking care not to damage the spinal cord during this
procedure. A dorsal hemisection until the central canal was performed
with a microknife (FST). To ensure that the lesion was complete, the
microknife was passed throughout the dorsal part of the spinal cord
several times. This kind of injury damages the dorsal and lateral CST, the
dorsal columns, the rubrospinal, the dorsal and lateral raphe-spinal, and
part of the reticulospinal tracts. For the laminectomy control surgery, the
dura mater was removed, but the dorsal hemisection was not performed.
After surgery, mice were placed back in their cages warmed up with an
infrared light to prevent hypothermia.Mice underwent daily check for gen-
eral health, mobility within the cage, wounds, swelling, infections, or au-
tophagy of the toes throughout the experiment. The animals showedneither
skin lesions nor autophagy throughout the study.Micewere injected subcu-
taneously with 1 ml of 0.9% saline twice daily for 3 d and once daily from
days4 to7after surgery.Bladdersweremanually expressed twicedaily for the
first week after operation and once daily until needed.
Tracer and virus injections
To trace the CST, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) mini-ruby (10% in
0.01 M PBS; 10,000MW; Invitrogen) injectionwas performed in the right
sensorimotor cortex (SMC) 14 dbefore killing. To infect layerVneurons,
Adeno-GFP or Adeno-GFP-p53 dual promoter viral constructs (5.3 
107 pfu) were injected through a glass capillary connected with a 5 l
Hamilton syringe in the right sensorimotor cortex on the day of the
spinal injury. Mice were anesthetized, and the head was shaved and
cleaned as above. Mice were placed on a stereotaxic device, the scalp was
incised, and a craniotomy on the right sensorimotor cortex was per-
formed with a drill. The viruses or the tracer were injected in a total of
four sites (0.4l per site over a period of 3–5 min, plus 3 min of the glass
capillary in place to avoid spillover), coordinates were 1.0mm lateral, 0.5
mm deep, and 0.5, 0.2, 0.7, and 1 mm with respect to bregma
(Steward et al., 2008).
Tissue preparation and sectioning
At the end of the survival period, the animals were deeply anesthetized
with ketamine (120 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (14 mg/kg body
weight) and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, and 4% PFA
in PBS, pH 7.4. Dissected brains and spinal cords were further postfixed
in 4% PFA in PBS at 4°C overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for
at least 48 h. After embedding in Tissue-Tek OCT compound, sagittal or
coronal spinal cord and coronal brain sections were cut to a thickness of
20 m. Sections were stored at20°C until further use.
Behavioral assessments
Training. All animals received training before surgery. The animals
were gently handled and then acclimated to the open field for the
locomotor test once daily for 10 sessions. They were also trained on
the grid walk and CatWalk runaway once daily for seven sessions;
each animal repeated three to four runs per session for each appara-
tus. For acclimation in the plantar heat test, each animal was allowed
to remain in an acrylic box (11.5 11.5 14 cm) on a glass floor for
10 min daily for four sessions.
Open-field test. The Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) (Basso et al., 2006) was
used to assess open-field locomotion for all injury group. Each animal

was allowed to freely move in the open field for 4 min while two inde-
pendent investigators blinded to the genotype scored it. The BMS score
and subscore were given. Mice were tested before the surgery and 1, 3, 7,
14, 21, and 28 d following injury. Only the animals that showed frequent
or consistent plantar stepping in the open field (BMS score 5) were
tested on the grid walk, CatWalk, and heat plantar test.
Grid walk. The grid walk test was used to evaluate the sensorimotor
coordination of the hindlimbs (Behrmann et al., 1992; Ma et al., 2001).
The animals were allowed to cross a 50 cmmetal grid of 1.2 1.2 cm grid
spaces for three times for each testing day. The number of missteps was
counted for each run. A misstep occurs when the animal cannot find or
properly position his paw on the grid and his foot slips through the grid.
Mice were tested before surgery and 14, 17, 21, 23, and 28 d following the
injury.
CatWalk automated quantitative gait analysis test. The CatWalk test was
used to evaluate basal motor behavior and coordination during continuous
locomotion along a walkway (Hamers et al., 2001). The CatWalk apparatus
andCatWalkXT 8.1 software (Noldus) were used. Each animal was allowed
to cross the runway, 8 50 cmwide with a glass floor, in a darkened room.
The green LED light internally reflected in the glass floor illuminates the
animal’s paws at the contact area only, producing a footprint. The CatWalk
apparatus also presents an illuminated ceiling with a red LED light that
makes thebodycontourof theanimalvisible.Ontheexperimentalday, three
runs for each animal were recorded from below the glass by a digital video
camera [50 (PAL) fields per second]. The runs were then analyzed to mea-
sure the average speed, the step length, and the stand time parameters. Ani-
mals were tested before surgery and 14, 21, and 28 d following injury.
Plantar heat test. This test was used to measure basal sensitivity to
noxious thermal stimulation. Thermal sensitivity of the plantar hind-
paws was tested according to Hargreaeves’ method (Hargreaves et al.,
1988; Mogil et al., 1999), with a plantar test device (Ugo Basile).
On the experimental days, the animals were handled and placed unre-
strained in an acrylic box for 10–15 min to acclimate before testing. An
infrared radial source (26W)was applied through a glass floor to themiddle
of theplantar surfaceof thehindpaw,between the footpads,when theanimal
was stationary. Eachmouse was tested for five times for each hindpaw, with
at least 30 s between trials, in a randomized order of testing to minimize
avoidance behavior. A 30 s cutoffwas set to avoid tissue damage. The timeof
withdrawals and any other behavior indicating a supraspinal response, such
as licking, looking at the affected paw, or attacking the stimulus, were re-
corded. Highest and lowest latencies for each paw were dropped, and the
remaining six latencies for each mouse were averaged. Animals were tested
before surgery, at 22, and 29 d following injury.
Histology
Antibody control experiments. Control experiments for antibody specificity
were performed using secondary antibody alone for each staining per-
formed. For the rabbit anti-p53 (CM5; Leica) antibody, spinal cord and
brain sections fromp53/micewere also stained. No specific stainingwas
seen in any condition. Full details of the primary antibodies used are re-
ported in Table 1.
Immunofluorescent staining. Sections of wt and p53/ spinal cords
were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 1 h at
room temperature and then incubated with rat anti-GFAP (Invitrogen)
or rabbit anti-fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies in 2% BSA, 0.2%
TBS–Triton at 4°C overnight. This was followed by incubation with Al-
exa Flour 488-conjugated goat anti-rat or anti-rabbit antibodies at room
temperature for 1 h. Counterstaining was performed with DAPI (1:
10,000) (Invitrogen) in PBS, and sections were coverslipped.
Immunofluorescent double staining. Spinal cord sections from wt
and p53/ mice were blocked with 10% BSA in TBS at room tem-
perature for 1 h and then incubated with rat anti-GFAP (Invitrogen)
in 2% BSA, 0.2% TBS–Triton or rat anti-CD11b (AbD Serotec) in 2%
BSA in TBS antibodies at 4°C, overnight. This was followed by incu-
bation with rabbit anti-rat biotinylated antibody (1:200) (Vector Lab-
oratories) in 2% BSA in TBS at room temperature for 1 h and
protection with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1:500) (In-
vitrogen) in 2% BSA in TBS at room temperature for 1 h. Antigen
retrieval with 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 6.2, at 98°C for 20 min was
performed, followed by blocking in 10% BSA in 0.2% TBS–Triton for
1 h at room temperature and incubation with mouse anti-Ki67 (BD
Biosciences Pharmingen) or rabbit anti-p53 (CM5; Novacastra) an-
tibodies in 2% BSA in 0.2% TBS–Triton at 4°C, overnight. Then the
sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-
mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1500) in 2% BSA in TBS for 1 h at
room temperature. Counterstaining was performed with DAPI (1:
10,000) (Invitrogen) in PBS, and sections were coverslipped. For p53
immunostaining, the antigen retrieval with 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH
6.2, was followed by proteinase K treatment at 37°C for 15 min.
Immunofluorescent staining for CD16/32, CD206, and Iba1. Spinal cord
sections from wt and p53/mice were blocked in 4% BSA, 0.1% TBS–
Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with rat
anti-CD16/32 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), goat anti-CD206 (R&D
Systems), or rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako Chemicals) in 2% BSA, 0.1% TBS–
Triton X-100 overnight at room temperature. This was followed by se-
quential incubation with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated donkey anti-goat
or anti-rat or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000) (In-
vitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were counterstained with
DAPI (1:10,000) for 15 min and coverslipped.
DAB immunostaining. Spinal cord or brain sections from wt and
p53/ mice were used. Antigen retrieval with 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH
6.2, at 98°C for 20min, followed by proteinase K treatment at 37°C for 15
min were performed in case of p53 staining. The peroxidase activity was
blocked in 0.3% H2O2 in TBS for 15 min at room temperature, the
sections were incubated in 10% BSA in TBS for 1 h at room temperature
and then with rabbit anti-p53 (CM5; Leica) antibody in 2% BSA 0.3%
TBS–Triton or rat anti-CD11b antibody (AbD Serotec) in 2% BSA TBS
at 4°C overnight. This was followed by incubation in biotinylated goat
anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-rat secondary antibodies (1:200) (Vector Lab-
oratories) in 2% BSA TBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by
incubation in ABC complex for 90 min at room temperature. Staining
was revealed with DAB. Counterstaining was performed with hematox-
ylin/eosin. Sections were dehydrated and coverslipped.
5-HT immunostaining.We followed a protocol for the detection of the
serotoninergic fibers optimized byMüllner et al. (2008). In brief, follow-
ing a second postfixation of the sections on slide (4% paraformaldehyde,
0.1% glutaraldehyde), antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (0.1 M), pH 4.5,
by microwave irradiation was performed. The sections were incubated
with rabbit anti-5-HT (4% normal goat serum in 0.3% TBS-TX; Immu-
noStar) antibody for 4 d at 4°C, followed by ABC complex and secondary
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:300; 2% normal goat serum in
0.3% TBS-TX) incubations. Then, the signal was further amplified with
biotinylated tyramide [50 mM borate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.25% biotin (long
arm) NHS; Vector Laboratories]. The signal was detected by incubation
in diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Vector Laboratories),
and the slides were dehydrated and coverslipped.
Reverse transcriptase qPCR. The lesion sites of the spinal cords fromwt
and p53/ mice were collected separately and snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen. The frozen tissues were ground with a pestle to a fine powder.
TotalRNAwasextractedwith theHighPureRNAParaffinkit (Roche).After
RNAquantification,1gof totalRNAforeachsamplewas retro-transcribed
into cDNA with the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase system (Invitro-
gen). The cDNAobtained from this reactionwas diluted 1:5, and 1l of the
diluted cDNA was used as template for each qPCR. Primers for p53, p21,
GAP-43, GADD45, Fibronectin, Collagen 12 and 41, and GAPDHwere
used (primer sequences are reported in Table 2). qPCRs were run in tripli-
cates using SYBRGreen probe (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and anABI Prism
7500system(AppliedBiosystems).Meltingcurveanalysiswasperformed for
each reaction to ensure single amplified products. Expression of the genes of
interest following the injurywas calculatedwith theCts analysis, normal-
izing to GAPDH and to the expression of the genes of interest in laminec-
tomy control operation for each gene.
Western blotting. The lesion sites of the spinal cords from wt and
p53/ mice were collected separately in RIPA buffer supplemented
with protease inhibitorsmixture (Roche) and sonicated. Protein concen-
tration was then determined by BCA assay kit (Pierce). Protein extracts
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane
(Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 8% skimmed milk or 5%

BSA in 0.1% TBS-T, accordingly to the first antibody used. Incubation
with rabbit anti-GFAP (Millipore) in 5% skimmed milk TBS, rabbit
anti-caspase-3 (Santa Cruz) in 2% BSA, 0.1% TBS-T, mouse anti-
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Merck) in 3% BSA in 0.1%
TBS-T, mouse anti-GAPDH (Millipore) in 3% skimmed milk TBS anti-
bodies was performed at 4°C overnight. This was followed by incubation
with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) at room temperature for 1 h. Protein bands were visualized on film
(GE Healthcare) using ECL-detecting reagents (Pierce). Full details of the pri-
mary antibodies used are reported inTable 1.
Anatomical analysis
All anatomical analyses were performed in a
blinded fashion.
Quantification of the lesion core and reactive
astrocytic areas. The area of the digitally ac-
quired images was determined with the mea-
sure outline option of the AxioVision software
(Zeiss). Three to five sagittal sections for each
spinal cord for each animal were analyzed. Sec-
tions were serially chosen (1:12) in the medial
part of the spinal cord, where the lesion tends
to be more consistent. The lesion core and the
reactive astrocytes area were identified as
fibronectin-, GFAP-immunopositive areas, re-
spectively. GFAP-negative tissue was defined as
tissue that shows absent or little GFAP immuno-
reactivity with only sparse GFAP-positive cells or
processes (Camand et al., 2004; Park et al., 2005).
Stereological analysis of activated microglia/
macrophages. Ten to 11 sagittal sections for
each spinal cord for each animalwere analyzed.
Sections were serially chosen (1:8), and the Ste-
reoInvestigator 7 (MBF Bioscience) software
was used to stereologically estimate the num-
ber of CD11b cells with the optical fractiona-
tor probe. Cells were counted within the lesion
site in anunbiased fashionby ablinded investiga-
tor. Inclusion criteria to determine activated
macrophage/microglia cells were the CD11b im-
munoreactivity and the round shape.
Quantification of proliferating astrocytes and
microglia/macrophages. Five to six sagittal sec-
tions for each spinal cord for each animal were
analyzed. Sections were serially chosen (1:8) as
representative of the most ventral part of the
lesion for consistency reasons. Photomicro-
graphs in z-stack were acquired with the Axio-
Vision software (Zeiss) through the Imager.Z1
microscope equipped with Apotome (Zeiss).
GFAP or CD11b positive and double positive
for Ki67 cells were counted within the reactive
astrocytic area at the lesion site.
Analysis ofM1/M2macrophagepopulations.To
determine the percentage of Iba1macrophages
thatwere expressingCD16/32orCD206, fluores-
cent images were collected at 20 on a Zeiss Ax-
ioScope2 equipped with Apotome. Two images
were collected per section (from five to six sec-
tions per animal) from regions just rostral and
caudal to the injury center. Total target areas of
Iba1, CD206, and CD16/32 staining were quan-
tified for each image using theMCIDElite image
analysis software (InterFocus Imaging). Target
area for CD206 and CD16/32 was normalized to
Iba1 target area for each image to calculate the
proportion of double-labeled cells.
Densitometry analysis of 5-HT immunoreactiv-
ity. Bright-field pictures were taken from four to
six random sections for each distance (2mmros-
tral, 1, 3, and5mmcaudal to the injury site) from
each spinal cord for each animal at constant illumination intensity (Faden et
al., 1988;Saruhashi et al., 1996;Oatwayetal., 2005).For laminaeVII–IX, care
was taken to exclude any fibers from the intermediolateral nucleus (IML) to
avoid redundant quantification. The digitalized images were converted in
grayscale format (8 bit), and the densitometry analysis was performed with
the software ImageJ (NIH). The area measured was held constant and the
background level was determined from an area of the ventral funiculus that
did not exhibit immunoreactivity. This background level was used to set the
threshold between labeled and background pixels.

genotypewere tested in the open field andwhen the animals show frequent or consistent plantar stepping (BMS score 5)were
tested in the other tasks (n 6–10 for each genotype). During test, scoring was performed by two investigators blinded to the
genotype. All measures are averages SEM.

Quantification of CST dieback, sprouting, and end bulbs. For each animal,
four to six consecutive sagittal sections from the most ventral part of the
spinal cord using the central canal as landmark were chosen and analyzed
with the software AxioVision (Zeiss) tomeasure the CST dieback or Stereo-
Investigator 7 (MBF Bioscience) to count axons, sprouts, and end bulbs.
Dieback of the dorsomedial CST was measured as the distance be-
tween the axon bundle and the border of the lesion site identified by
GFAP immunoreactivity (Shen et al., 2009). The quantification of the
sprouting and end-bulb indexes of the dorsomedial CST was performed
proximal to the lesion site at rostral and caudal level. For each section, the
BDA-labeled sprouts, end bulbs, and axons were counted live. The sum
of the total number of labeled sprouts or bulbs was normalized to the
total number of labeled axons above the lesion site counted in all the
analyzed sections for each animal, obtaining an interanimal comparable
ratio considering the individual tracing variability (Schnell and Schwab,
1993; Simonen et al., 2003). Sprouts and regrowing fibers were defined
following the anatomical criteria reported by Steward et al. (2003).
Briefly, we considered as a sprout or a regrowing axon fibers that origi-
nate at or near an amputation site, take unusual paths through the tissue
environment, are tipped with growth cones, or present unusual mor-
phology (e.g., unusual branching pattern).
Primary microglia cultures
Purified microglia was prepared from neonatal P1–P3 wt and p53/
mice as described previously (Saura et al., 2003). Briefly, cortices were
dissected out, the meninges were carefully removed, and the tissue was
mincedwithmicroscissors. After incubationwith 0.125% trypsin EDTA/
HBSS for 10–15 min at 37°C, a single-cell suspension was obtained by
trituration through a fire-polished glass pipette. The suspension was fil-
tered through a 40 m filter to remove debris. After a subsequent wash,
cells were plated in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks at 62,500 cells per cm2.
Cultures were incubated in standard cell culture conditions until conflu-
ency. At this stage, flasks were maintained for an additional 2 weeks.
Cultures maintained for 20–25 DIV were incubated with 0.25% tryp-
sin in DMEM/F-12 (1:4) until the top layer of cells has detached. The
remaining microglia were detached with undiluted trypsin and vigorous
pipetting. These cells were used for all subsequent assays and were typi-
cally95% microglia as assessed by CD11b staining.
Proliferation assay
In vitro cell proliferation was assessed in microglia cultures by using a
fluorometric BrdU cell proliferation assay (Calbiochem). The assay was
performed per the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, freshly purified cells
were plated at 8000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. BrdU was added to the
cell culturemedium (10%FBS/DMEM) for a period of 48 h, at the end of
which the plate was processed to read in a fluorescence plate reader.
Proliferation assay with adenovirus infection
For these experiments, freshly isolated cells were plated at 5000 cells per
well in 96-well plates and incubated in standard cell culture conditions
for 24 h. Cells were then infected with Adeno-GFP virus or Adeno-p53
virus at 100 MOI. A no-virus control was also included. After an addi-
tional 24 h, BrdU was added to the cell culture medium for 24 h, and the
plate was processed at the end of this 24 h period.
Cell survival
In vitro cell death was assessed using the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis
detection kit (Calbiochem) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,

freshly purified microglia was plated at 150,000 cells per well in a 24-well
plate. Cells were incubated under standard cell culture conditions for
48 h similar to the proliferation assay. At the end of this time period, the
apoptosis assaywas performed.Wellmedia containing floating dead cells
were removed and kept. Cells were detached after an incubation with
0.25% trypsin and the suspension added to the media from before. The
staining protocol allows identification of Annexin V (early apoptotic)
and AxV/PI double-positive cells (late apoptotic and necrotic cells) by
FACS analysis.
Immunocytochemistry
For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated in 96-well plates or 12 mm
coverslips in 24-well platesmaintained in standard culture conditions for
24 h. Cell were fixedwith 4%PFA and permeabilizedwith 0.1%TritonX.
After several PBS washes, cells were incubated with primary antibody for
30 min at room temperature or in some cases
90 min at 4°C. After subsequent PBS washes,
cells were incubated with secondary antibody
for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were
washed and stained with DAPI to visualize nu-
clei, and coverslips were mounted. The follow-
ing antibodies were used: rat anti-CD11b
(Serotec), rabbit anti-p53 (Novocastra), and
rabbit anti-cleaved caspase (Cell Signaling).
Primary cortical neurons and transfections
Briefly, cortices from 17- to 18-d-old embryos
were cleaned from their meninges and blood
vessels in Krebs’–Ringer’s bicarbonate buffer
containing 0.3% BSA. Cortices were minced
and dissociated in the same buffer with 1800
U/ml trypsin at 37°C for 20 min. Following the
addition of 200 U/ml DNase I and 3600 U/ml
soybean trypsin inhibitor to the suspension,
cells were triturated through a 5 ml pipette.
After the tissue was allowed to settle for 5–10
min, the supernatant was collected, and the re-
maining tissue pellet was retitrated. The com-
bined supernatants were centrifuged through a
4% BSA layer, and the cell pellet was resus-
pended in NSM (neuronal seeding medium),
which consisted of B27–Neurobasal medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 1.1% 100
antibiotic–antimycotic solution, 25 M Na-
glutamate, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 2% B27
supplement (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded
at a density of 5  10 5 cells/ml onto poly-D-
lysine-coated (70–150 kDa) 96-well plates
(Corning) or 60mmPetri dishes (Falcon; BD
Biosciences Discovery Labware). Arabino-
furanosyl cytidine (Ara-C) was added 24 h
after plating (5 M). Briefly, transfections
with CMV GFP or CMV p53-GFP plasmid
DNA were performed using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) 24 h after plating follow-
ing standard procedures. Cells were fixed
72 h following transfection.
Neurite outgrowth
Neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons was eval-
uatedby calculating the lengthof the longest pro-
cess per cell. Measurements were taken from
three individual experimentsby twodifferentop-
erators. For each experimental condition, at least
30–40 cells were counted. Cells were viewed us-
ing a CCD camera and analyzed with the image
analysis software AxioVision 3.1 (Zeiss). Trans-
fected neurons and neurites were identified by
double labeling for GFP and 3-tubulin.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using PASW
Statistics 18 software. Student’s t test with or without Bonferroni’s cor-
rection or repeated-measurement ANOVA was used as indicated.
Results
p53/mice show impaired recovery of motor functions
following spinal cord injury
To investigate whether the transcription factor p53 plays a rele-
vant role in the pathophysiological response following SCI, we
first evaluated the effect of the absence of p53 on the recovery of
motor functions following SCI in mice. wt and p53/ mice
underwent a T10 spinal cord bilateral dorsal hemisection (Fig.
1A) and their functional recovery was evaluated for 4 weeks with
a set of motor and sensory behavioral tasks, including the open

field, scored with the BMS (Basso et al., 2006), the grid walk, the
automated CatWalk, and the Hargraeves’ plantar heat test. Al-
though p53/ mice were indistinguishable from wt during the
training period and the preinjury test sessions, they showed a
significant impairment in the recovery of motor functions fol-
lowing spinal cord injury (Fig. 1B–F).
Specifically, in the open-field task, p53/ mice scored signifi-
cantly worse than wt at 21 and 28 d following SCI. The impairment
was mainly due to the frequency of plantar stepping, the grade of
coordination, the paw position during stance, and the degree of
trunk instability (Fig. 1B,C). In the grid walk, p53/mice placed
the hindpaws less accurately than wt when crossing the grid, result-
ing in statistically significantlymoremistakes at all timepoints tested
afterSCI (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, takingadvantageof theautomated
CatWalk, we also analyzed parameters that allowed us to evaluate
finer locomotor functions. In particular, the average speed of the
walkway crossing aswell as the average stride length of the hindpaws
were significantly reduced in p53/ compared with wt mice fol-
lowing SCI (Fig. 1E,F). Finally, to determine whether p53 was in-
volved in the postinjury adaptation of the sensory response, we used
theHargraeves’ heat plantar test.We did not observe a difference in
the hindpaw withdrawal time between the two genotypes and be-
tween preoperation or postoperation at the tested time points (Fig.
1G), suggesting that p53 does not play amajor role in the rearrange-
ment of the sensory fibers following SCI. The absence of a difference
in wtmice between preoperative and postoperative time points is in
accordance with the observation of Hill et al. (2009) for the dorsal
spinal cord hemisection.
p53/mice show increased CST dieback and reduced CST
and 5-HT sprouting following spinal cord injury
The degree of functional recovery following SCI depends on the
reorganization and the formation of new circuits due to synaptic
plasticity and collateral sprouting of lesioned and unlesioned de-
scending tracts (Raineteau and Schwab, 2001; Cafferty et al.,
2008).
Since the absence of p53 leads to a significant impairment in
functional recovery following SCI, we investigated the role of p53

on axonal sprouting of the functionally relevant serotoninergic
(5-HT) fibers and the CST (Faden et al., 1988; Bregman et al.,
1995; Saruhashi et al., 1996; Maier et al., 2009). Indeed, by 5-HT
immunostaining, we observed a significant reduction in sprout-
ing of the 5-HTaxons in the laminaeVII and IXof the graymatter
and in the IML at 1, 3, and 5mm below, but not 2 mm above, the
injury site in p53/ compared with wt mice (Fig. 2A–D). The
layer V neurons were labeled by BDA tracer injection in the SMC,
and, at the spinal cord level, the CST sprouting and retraction
bulb indexes were calculated normalizing the total number of
sprouts or retraction bulbs to the total number of labeled axons,
since the total number of BDA-labeled axons varies from animal
to animal (Schnell and Schwab, 1993; Simonen et al., 2003). We
first found that p53/mice displayed reduced CST sprouting 5
mm above the injury site, suggesting impaired axonal plasticity
compared with wt (Fig. 3A). Then, we observed a more pro-
nounced dieback of the CST, decreased sprouting, and an in-
creased number of retraction bulbs just rostral to the lesion site in
p53/mice (Fig. 3B–E).
Collectively, these data support a role for p53 in the regulation of
5-HT and CST sprouting following SCI and partially explain the
impairment in the recovery of motor function following SCI in ab-
sence of p53. However, they do not exclude that p53 may influence
the inhibitory extrinsic response to the injury, which affects growth
cone collapse and retraction of the damaged axons and therefore the
degree of axonal dieback and sprouting (Yiu andHe, 2006).
p53/mice display increased number of activated
microglia/macrophages and enhanced scar formation
following spinal cord injury
Given the role of p53 in the cell cycle arrest checkpoint in dividing
cells and in apoptosis in cells under several stressors (Pietenpol
and Stewart, 2002; Oren, 2003), we hypothesized that p53 would
also affect the formation of the glial scar. The glial scar is in fact
highly dependent upon the proliferation of reactive astrocytes
and microglia/blood-derived macrophages as well as on the de-
gree of cell death at the lesion site (Tian et al., 2006, 2007; Wu et
al., 2011).
In accordance with previous data (Saito et al., 2000), high
nuclear expression of p53 in the spinal cord is induced following
injury in a time-dependent manner, with a peak between 2 and
3 d after injury, in several glial cells such as astrocytes and acti-
vated microglia/macrophages (data not shown). More impor-
tantly, we ascertained by RT-qPCR that p53was transcriptionally
active, as shown by an enhanced expression of p53 target genes
p21 (cell cycle arrest gene), GADD-45 (DNA damage sensor),
and GAP-43 (axonal outgrowth and regeneration gene) in wt
versus p53/ cords after SCI (Fig. 4A).
To investigate the role of p53 on the scar formation, we per-
formed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for fibronectin and GFAP
on spinal cord sections from p53/ versus wtmice, 28 d follow-
ing SCI. We observed an enlarged deposition of fibronectin re-
sulting in a bigger lesion core area and a larger area of reactive
astrocytes surrounding the lesion borders in p53/ compared
with wt spinal cords (Fig. 4B–F). Furthermore, immunoblot
analysis of the lesion site showed an increased expression of
GFAP in absence of p53 comparedwith wt following SCI, but not
in laminectomy control conditions (Fig. 4G,H).
As observed by RT-qPCR analysis of spinal cord lesion site,
the absence of p53 resulted in an increased gene expression of
several scar-related genes, including fibronectin, collagen 12
and collagen 41 (Fig. 4 I), but not of others such as TGF1,
tenascin-c, or neurocan 3 d following SCI (data not shown). Fur-
thermore, immunoblot analysis of the protein expression levels
of the abundant chondroitinase sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) ag-
grecan was not significantly different between the two genotypes
at 3 and 28 d after SCI (data not shown). These data suggest an
involvement of p53 in regulation of the expression of fibrotic
scar-associated extracellular matrix components but not of pro-
teoglycans (Moore and Goldberg, 2011).
Given that glial scar formation is in part dependent upon the
postinjury inflammatory response, including the contribution of
rapidly dividing activatedmicroglia andmacrophages, and the rele-
vance of this response in the recovery ofmotor functions (Popovich
et al., 1999; Jones et al., 2005; Loane and Byrnes, 2010), we assessed

the potential influence of p53 on the num-
ber of activatedmicroglia andmacrophages
following SCI. To this end, we performed
anti-CD11b IHC on spinal cord sections of
p53/ and wt mice, 28 d following SCI,
and we stereologically counted the number
of activated microglia/macrophages. Im-
portantly, we found a significant increase in
the number of these cells at the lesion site in
p53/ versus wt spinal cords (Fig. 5A–C),
suggesting the presence of amore aggressive
postinjury inflammatory response.Notably,
we did not observe any difference in the
number of CD11b cells between geno-
types following laminectomy control sur-
gery (Fig. 5C). As the polarization of
microglia/macrophages toward an M1 or
M2 phenotype can influence their proin-
flammatory properties (Kigerl et al., 2009),
we investigated whether p53 may regulate
the commitment toward M1 versus M2
phenotype of microglia/macrophages fol-
lowing SCI. To this end, we quantified the
percentage of the CD16/32- and CD206-
positive cells at the lesion site 28 d following
SCI. We did not observe any difference be-
tween p53/ and wt mice, ruling out a
possible role of p53 in regulating the polar-
ization ofmicroglia/macrophages following
SCI (Fig. 5D).
p53 regulates glial proliferation at the
lesion site following spinal cord injury
Furthermore, we investigated the poten-
tial role of p53 in the regulation of the
proliferation of astrocytes and microglia/
macrophages in vivo. We performed im-
munoblotting for the cell proliferation
marker PCNA and double immunofluo-
rescent staining for GFAP/Ki67 and
CD11b/Ki67 at 3 d following SCI on wt
and p53/ spinal cords, a time point at
which nuclear p53 is highly expressed
(Saito et al., 2000). We observed an in-
creased protein expression of PCNAat the
lesion site in p53/ compared with wt
mice following SCI, but not following
laminectomy (Fig. 6A,B), and an in-
creased number of CD11b/Ki67, but not
GFAP/Ki67 double-positive cells in
p53/ comparedwithwt spinal cords af-
ter SCI (Fig. 6E–J). Importantly, PCNA
expression was not detectable by Western
blotting (WB) analysis at 28 d after injury,
when the number of double-positive GFAP/Ki67 and CD11b/
Ki67 cells was also dramatically reduced in a comparable fashion
in both genotypes (data not shown), supporting the concept that
p53 is transiently activated in proliferating cells in the injured
spinal cord.
In addition, to assess a role for p53 in the regulation of cell
death at the lesion site following SCI, we performed immuno-
blotting analysis for procaspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 on pro-
tein extracts form the lesion site fromp53/ andwt spinal cords
at 1 and 3 d following SCI, a time window of high expression of
cleaved caspase-3 (Knoblach et al., 2005).We did not observe any
difference in caspase-3 protein expression levels between the two
genotypes at 1 d (Fig. 6C,D), while we did not detect cleaved
caspase-3 at 3 d after injury (data not shown), supporting a spe-
cific role for p53 in the regulation of cell proliferation rather than
apoptosis in this spinal cord injury model.
So far, we have shown that p53 plays an important role in
regulating axonal sprouting and glial proliferation as well as in

scar formation following SCI. However, it is not clear yet whether
p53 is able to directly control axonal sprouting following spinal
cord injury or whether impairment in sprouting and enhanced
axonal dieback are only due to the increased glial scar.
p53 regulates microglial proliferation but not apoptosis
To clarify the cellular mechanisms through which p53 may reg-
ulate the number of microglia/macrophages after SCI, we de-
cided to investigate the role of p53 in the regulation of their
proliferation and survival. To this end, we cultured primary mi-
croglia from wt and p53/mice and performed BrdU incorpo-
ration experiments. We observed an increase in proliferation of
p53/ cells that could be significantly reduced by viral expres-
sion of Adeno-p53 in p53/ cells (Fig.
7A,B), showing a relevant p53-dependent
effect on the proliferation of microglia.
Furthermore, FACS analysis of apoptotic
Annexin V-positive microglial cells ex-
cluded a role for p53 in apoptosis of cul-
tured microglia (Fig. 7C). Similarly, viral
expression of p53 in p53/ cells did not
affect apoptosis of those cells (Fig. 7D),
but only decreased their proliferation
(Fig. 7A,B). In immunocytochemistry ex-
periments, we also assessed that p53 was
expressed in cultured microglia in basal
conditions and that the expression was
strongly enhanced by p53 adenoviral in-
fection (data not shown).
Importantly, to evaluate p53 tran-
scriptional activity in cultured micro-
glia, we measured the expression of p21,
a readout of p53 transcription and a cell
cycle arrest gene (el-Deiry et al., 1993).
We found a significant reduction of p21
expression in p53/ microglia, which
was significantly rescued by expression
of p53, paralleling the observed arrest in
cell proliferation (Fig. 7E).
Viral expression of p53 in layer V
neurons enhances CST sprouting
following spinal cord injury
To assess whether the more pronounced
impairment in axonal sprouting of su-
praspinal descending fibers following SCI
observed in p53/mice was at least par-
tially due to a direct role of p53 in the
outgrowth of CST axons, we reintroduced
p53 in the SMC of p53/ mice. A dual
CMV promoter adenovirus driving p53
and GFP or a control GFP adenovirus
were stereotaxically injected in the SMC
of p53/mice at the time of a T10 spinal
cord bilateral dorsal hemisection (Fig.
8A). CST axons were traced with BDA,
and the CST sprouting was evaluated at
28 d following SCI. p53 viral expression,
as detected by the reporter gene GFP, was
visible as early as at 72 h in the layer V
neurons (Fig. 8B) and lasted until 28 d
after injury (Fig. 8C).
The reintroduction of p53 in the SMC
of p53/mice resulted in a significant increased CST sprouting
5mm above the lesion site, suggesting enhanced axonal plasticity
(Fig. 8D). Importantly, p53 overexpression increased the num-
ber of axonal collateral sprouts rostral to the lesion site (Fig. 8E),
also resulting in an intricate net of sprouts, mostly in the white
matter (Fig. 8D). The observed sprouts rostral to the lesion often
showed a growth cone at the end and a tortuous course, accord-
ing to some of the criteria to identify regrowing axons (Steward et
al., 2003). However, in this rescue experiment on a p53/ back-
ground, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in
the number of axonal sprouts below the injury site compared
with p53/mice injected with the control GFP adenovirus (Fig.
8F). The inability of these mice to significantly regrow the CST

below the lesion site could be due to the
highly inhibiting environment that devel-
ops in the absence of p53. Importantly,
this experiment suggests that p53 is re-
quired to directly modulate CST axonal
sprouting in vivo following SCI.
Finally, to further ascertain whether res-
cue of p53 expression on a p53/ back-
ground leads to recovery of neurite
outgrowth through the modulation of a
neuronal intrinsic mechanism, we per-
formed p53 rescue experiments in cultured
primary cortical neurons. Embryonic corti-
calneurons (E18) fromwtandp53/mice
were transfected with GFP (wt), p53-GFP,
or GFP (p53/), and neurite length was
analyzed 72 h after transfection. Measure-
ment of neurite outgrowth in transfected
GFP-positive cells showed thatp53/neu-
rons had an impairment in neurite length
(length of longest neurite) that could be
fully rescued by overexpression of p53-GFP
(Fig. 9A,B).
Overall, our data support a model in
which p53 plays a dual role in the regula-
tion of both the neuronal intrinsic and
glial extrinsic responses following SCI.
Discussion
Poor functional recovery following SCI is
due to both the development of an inhib-
itory glial environment that limits axonal

sprouting and regeneration (Silver andMiller, 2004; Yiu and He,
2006) and to the limited intrinsic neuronal capacity to regrow
damaged axons (Di Giovanni, 2009;Moore andGoldberg, 2011).
Our findings suggest that the transcription factor p53 modulates
both the extrinsic spinal inhibitory environment and the intrinsic
capacity of CNSneurons affecting the recovery ofmotor function
in response to a traumatic event.
We have previously found that p53 can occupy the promoters
and drive the expression of a number of genes involved in neurite
and axonal outgrowth such asCoronin 1b, Rab13 (DiGiovanni et
al., 2006), and GAP-43 (Tedeschi et al., 2009a; Floriddia et al.,
2011). Moreover, p53 transcriptionally enhances the expression
of cGKI, thereby inhibiting semaphorin 3A-dependent growth
cone collapse in primary cortical and dorsal root ganglia neurons
(Tedeschi et al., 2009b). p53 also mediates transcription-
independent pro-outgrowth pathways, by inhibiting local ROCK
(Rho-associated protein kinase) activity at the growth cone coun-
teracting growth cone collapse (Qin et al., 2009). Interestingly,
semaphorin 3A-mediated growth cone collapse leads to trunca-
tion of phosphorylated active p53 via m-calpain, leading to Rho
kinase activation, which is antagonized by phosphorylated p53
(Qin et al., 2010).
Here, we show for the first time that p53 is needed for physi-
ological sprouting of 5-HT and corticospinal axons following
SCI. p53/mice display amore pronounced dieback of the CST
axon bundle and a reduced collateral sprouting compared with
the already limited spontaneous sprouting response of the CST
that occurs in adult wild-type animals after transection (Schnell
and Schwab, 1993). We also found that sprouting of 5-HT fibers
below the lesion site is reduced in absence of p53. As previously
described, the degree of 5-HT spinal sprouting as well as sero-
toninergic transmission below the injury
site strongly correlate with the recovery of
locomotor function of the hindlimbs fol-
lowing experimental SCI (Faden et al.,
1988; Bregman et al., 1995; Saruhashi et
al., 1996; Maier et al., 2009). Together
with our data, this suggests a role for p53
in the regulation of axonal regrowth and
plasticity remodeling of the damaged spi-
nal cord that leads to partial recovery of
motor function.
The impaired sprouting of supraspinal
descending fibers in p53/mice is likely
both a consequence of the abnormal in-
hibitory glial scar at the lesion site and of a
role for p53 in the intrinsic neuronal plas-
tic response to injury, as our gain-of-
function experiments both in cultured
neurons and in vivo in the SMC suggest. In
fact, delivery of p53 in neurite outgrowth-
deficient p53/ cultured cortical neurons
restores physiological neurite outgrowth,
and more importantly, viral overexpres-
sion of p53 in the SMC of p53/ mice
reestablishes and boosts the physiological
sprouting plastic response that is very lim-
ited in wild-type CST. In fact, following
rescue of p53 expression, transected CST
axons show more sprouts and branches
near the amputation site preferentially
but not exclusively in the white matter
facing the upper part of the cordwhere the
dorsal columns physiologically run. Importantly, as expected
from such a rescue experiment on a null background, we did not
observe CST regeneration nor significantly enhanced axonal
sprouting below the injury site. Nevertheless, the CST collateral
sprouting above the injury site suggests an important role for p53
in axonal plasticity following SCI.
After spinal cord injury, cell cycle activation in neurons and
glial cells is a crucial event that contributes to secondary damage,
such as tissue loss and activation of astrocytes and microglia,
negatively affecting the recovery of motor function (Di Giovanni
et al., 2003; Byrnes et al., 2007). Here, we report that p53 is re-
quired to maintain the proliferation of microglia/macrophages
under check, providing evidence for a further novel non-
neuronal role for p53 following SCI. This effect on cell cycle is
specifically dependent upon p53 as demonstrated by the gain-of-
function experiments in which p53 overexpression can restore
microglia proliferation to wt levels in p53/ cells. The main
contribution of p53 to the control of proliferation is likely due to
the marked downregulation of p21 in p53/ cells, which p53
overexpression promptly rescues along with reducing prolifera-
tion. Indeed, p21 is a well established specific p53-transcriptional
target in a variety of cell types and tissues (el-Deiry et al., 1993;
Missero et al., 1996) and a powerful cell cycle inhibitor via antag-
onism of CDK 2/4/6 (Johnson and Walker, 1999). Importantly,
p53 does not seem to affect cell survival in these cells as shown by
in the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and caspase-3 expression. This
is in agreementwith the evidence that p53-dependent cell death is
typically present only in highly damaged cells, for example fol-
lowing high levels of genotoxic and oxidative stress or growth
factor deficiency, which are known to trigger p53-dependent ap-

optosis (Aloyz et al., 1998; Sakaguchi et al., 1998; Culmsee and
Mattson, 2005; Liebermann et al., 2007).
Following spinal cord injury, the inflammatory response plays
a pivotal role in contributing to secondary damage and crafting
the lesion environment (Alexander and Popovich, 2009). In fact,
activatedmicroglia/macrophages can be detrimental by releasing
proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and axonal
outgrowth inhibitory keratane sulfate proteoglycans (Jones and
Tuszynski, 2002; Bareyre and Schwab, 2003; Jones et al., 2005;
David andKroner, 2011). The increased proliferation of activated
microglia/macrophages at the lesion site after SCI in p53/mice
could lead to an aberrant inflammatory response, exacerbated
secondary degeneration, and the formation of a more aggressive
inhibitory environment, contributing to a more pronounced
motor impairment. The inhibition of glial proliferation by sev-
eral pharmacological strategies including the use of cell cycle in-
hibitors (Wu et al., 2011), such as Ara-C and Flavopiridol
(Rhodes et al., 2003;DiGiovanni et al., 2005c; Byrnes et al., 2007),
or the depletion of hematogenous macrophages by liposome-
encapsulated clodronate (Popovich et al., 1999), has been shown
to enhance axonal sprouting and functional recovery after both
brain and spinal cord injury.
The role of p53 in regulating microglia/macrophage activity
has not been extensively studied. A previous study suggested an
increase inNF-B-dependent transcription of several proinflam-
matory targets in p53/macrophages (Komarova et al., 2005);
however, we found that the postinjury gene expression of IL-1,
IL-6, and TNF in the spinal cord was not affected by the absence
of p53 (data not shown). Recent reports have indicated that, in a
contusion spinal injury model, there is a predominance of classi-
cally activated orM1macrophages at chronic stages after SCI and
they contribute to the inhibition of axon regrowth (Kigerl et al.,
2009) and to increased axon dieback (Horn et al., 2008), while
M2 macrophages were shown to be neuroprotective in compar-
ison. Interestingly, certainM2 subtypes have been associatedwith
wound healing, matrix remodeling, and fibrosis (Wynn and Bar-
ron, 2010). Therefore, an aberrant M2 response could generate
an environment that exacerbates scar formation after SCI. How-
ever, our data show that the absence of p53 does not alterM1/M2
polarization after SCI.
The glial and fibrotic scar formation is another crucial event in
the response after SCI. Indeed, several components from the dis-
ruptedmyelin and extracellularmatrix components produced by
reactive astrocytes, microglia, and fibrocytes show strong inhib-
itory properties on axonal outgrowth and regeneration, limiting
the recovery of motor function after injury (Savio and Schwab,
1990; Schnell and Schwab, 1990; McKerracher et al., 1994; Breg-
man et al., 1995; Davies et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2000; Bradbury et
al., 2002; GrandPré et al., 2002; Kottis et al., 2002; Sroga et al.,
2003; Silver andMiller, 2004; Yiu andHe, 2006;Hellal et al., 2011;
Wang et al., 2011). In p53/ injured cords, aberrant glial pro-
liferation is accompanied by enhanced glial scar formation, as
shown by GFAP- and fibronectin-positive scar tissue revealing a
bigger reactive astrocyte area around the lesion site and an en-
larged lesion core. Furthermore, mRNA expression analysis of
the lesion site shows that genes associated with the fibrotic scar,
including fibronectin, collagen 12, and collagen 41 (Stichel et
al., 1999; Klapka et al., 2005; Moore and Goldberg, 2011) are
differentially expressed in the absence of p53 following SCI.
This observation gives us an insight of additional possible
molecular components andmechanisms that contribute to the
limited locomotor functional recovery we observed in p53/
mice after SCI.
Together, our data show that p53 is involved in the regulation
of axonal sprouting and plasticity, glial and fibrotic scar forma-
tion, and proliferation of microglia/macrophages affecting the
recovery of motor function following SCI; in summary, we pro-
pose that, in response to a trauma, p53 plays a dual role at neu-
ronal intrinsic and glial extrinsic levels. This suggests the
modulation of p53 as a potential multilevel therapeutic strategy,
which could be achieved by fine-tuning p53 at posttranslational
or expression levels.
However, complementary studies with a compressive/contu-
sive lesionmodel in p53mutant mice would also be warranted to
provide more convincing evidence of a translationally relevant
role for p53.
