ABSTRACT
Transplanted stem cells provide beneficial effects on regeneration/recovery after spinal cord injury
(SCI) by the release of growth-promoting factors, increased tissue preservation, and provision of a
permissive environment for axon regeneration. A rise in chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1
(SDF-1/CXCL12) expression levels in central nervous system (CNS) injury sites has been shown toplay
a central role in recruiting transplanted stem cells. Although technically more challenging, it has
been shown that after SCI few endogenous stem cells are recruited via SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling.
Evidence is accumulating that increasing SDF-1 levels at the injury site (e.g., by exogenous applica-
tion or transfection methods) further enhances stem cell recruitment. Moreover, SDF-1 might, in
addition to migration, also influence survival, proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine secretion
of stem cells. Here, we discuss the experimental data available on the role of SDF-1 in stem and
progenitor cell biology following CNS injury and suggest strategies for how manipulation of the
SDF-1 system could facilitate stem cell-based therapeutic approaches in SCI. In addition, we discuss
challenges such as how to circumvent off-target effects in order to facilitate the transfer of SDF-1 to
the clinic. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2012;1:732–739
INTRODUCTION
Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), also known
as CXCL12, and its G-protein-coupled receptors
CXCR4 and CXCR7 play a critical role in the devel-
opment of the central nervous system (CNS) and
heart, respectively, as their deficiency is lethal
during either embryonic or perinatal develop-
ment [1, 2]. CXCR4- and SDF-1-deficient mice
show abnormal development of the dentate
gyrus of the hippocampus [3, 4] and the granule
cell layer of the cerebellum [1, 5]. In the adult
spinal cord, SDF-1 is expressedmainly in the dor-
sal corticospinal tract and the meninges [6],
whereas its receptor CXCR4 is strongly expressed
in the ependymal layer of the central canal [6, 7].
After traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), SDF-1 and
CXCR4 expression is upregulated on mRNA and
protein level 2 days postoperation (dpo) in a rat
model of light and severe thoracic spinal cord
contusion. Induced expression levels are also de-
tectable at 42 dpo [8]. The main source of SDF-1
after SCI is most likely reactive astrocytes [8],
which also upregulate SDF-1 after stroke [9] and
hypoxic-ischemic injury [10]. Cell types secreting
SDF-1 and carrying CXCR4 in the context of SCI
are shown in Table 1.
STEM CELL TYPES
Established stem cell types that are frequently
used in experimental models of spinal cord re-
pair are considered in this review, including em-
bryonic stem cells (ESCs) and somatic stem cells.
The latter are found in fetal, neonatal, and ma-
ture tissues of different organs and comprise, for
example, neural progenitor cells and mesenchy-
mal stem cells. The potential of stem cells to gen-
erate various cell types has received great inter-
est for preclinical and clinical investigations to
treat and regenerate the injured spinal cord. On
the other hand, beneficial effects have been
demonstrated without any lineage-specific dif-
ferentiation or obvious cell replacement. The
ability of transplanted stem cells or their deriva-
tives to release growth-promoting factors or
modulate the inflammatory response, providing
a permissive environment for regenerating ax-
ons or neuroprotection, is discussed. Spinal cord
injury has a great impact on cell motility of en-
dogenous or transplanted stem cells, which is in-
fluenced by several chemoattractants and cell-
surface adhesion molecules. The SDF-1/CXCR4
axis plays a critical role for stem cell motility, as
well as for stem cell survival and self-renewal,

which is discussed in detail in this section. Furthermore, recent
approaches to manipulating the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis to enhance
regeneration after spinal cord injury are discussed (Fig. 1).
Endogenous Spinal Cord Stem Cells
After SCI, endogenous proliferating progenitor cells [11, 12] mi-
grate to the site of injury. It is assumed that neural precursor cells
(NPCs) originate from the ependyma of the central canal and the
subpial layer in the adult spinal cord [11–14] and differentiate into
neural cells after SCI [15–18]. These findings indicate that adult en-
dogenous NPCsmight be useful to enhance functional recovery.
As SDF-1 has been shown to be crucial during development
of the CNS, it is suggested that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis might also
play a key role in migration of adult endogenous stem cells after
SCI [19]. In the adult spinal cord, the chemokine receptor CXCR4
is strongly expressed in the ependymal layer around the central
canal from which endogenous stem cells originate [6, 7]. How-
ever, the specific function of CXCR4 expression in ependymal
cells is still unknown.
In the report by Knerlich-Lukoschus et al. [8] it is shown that
radial glia-like cells that appear in the subpial layer express CXCR4
andSDF-1 after SCI. However, although the specific functionof SDF-
1/CXCR4 in radial glia-like cells after SCI has yet to be defined, the
impact onproliferation, survival, andmigration to the injury sitehas
been described for neural precursor cells (see below).
Exogenous Stem Cells
Multipotent Neural Lineage Restricted Progenitor Cells
During development of the CNS, CXCR4 is highly expressed in the
ventricular zone [20, 21]. Expression of CXCR4 has also been de-
tected in adult neurogenic regions [22], as well as in both human
and rodent adult NPCs from different sources in vitro [23–25].
Grafted NPCs invade damaged areas in various lesion paradigms
[26, 27], where they promote recovery through either differen-
tiation into neural cells or neuroprotective [27] and neurite
growth-promoting [28] functions. ESCs, on the other hand, are
mostly transplanted after predifferentiation into highly purified
neural cell populations to avoid tumor formation. Transplanta-
tion of ESC-derivedNPCs into the injured spinal cord (SC) leads to
results similar to those described for NPCs [29–31]. Importantly,
responsiveness to injury-mediated migratory stimuli is variable
between different NPC populations [32]. NPC as well as ESC-
derived NPC migration is mediated mainly by CXCR4, as NPCs
respond to SDF-1 by migrating in a dose-dependent manner [21,
33–35]. Because of inflammation, transplanted NPCs upregulate
both CXCR4 and CXCR7 [34], possibly leading to enhancedmigra-
tion to the site of injury. In addition to an increased migratory
potential, transplantation ofNPCs into the subacute SCI seems to
be optimal as NPCs show a good survival rate and lead to func-
tional recovery [36]. However, not all migrating NPC populations
express CXCR4 as shown for human NPCs derived from fetal
brain tissue that have been transplanted into the ischemic rat
brain. Here, only subpopulations of the NPCs expressed CXCR4,
but all transplanted cells showed extensive migration potency
[26]. These data indicate a CXCR4-independent mechanism of
migration that might include CC chemokine receptors. CCR2-ex-
pressing NPCs are known to respond to sites of inflammation, as
NPCs generated from CCR2 knockout mice exhibit only little mi-
gration toward inflammatory sites [37]. Furthermore, hepato-
cyte growth factor (HGF) has been described to regulate neural
stem cell migration [38]. After SCI, transplanted NPCs respond
with migration to the lesion site and improve locomotor recov-
ery because of differentiation into functional neural cells [36, 39,
40] or because of their supportive properties [28, 41]. It is sug-
gested that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is the key player for NPC mi-
gration. As SDF-1 enhances NPC proliferation [14, 33, 42] and
survival [43], coadministration of SDF-1 might be a possibility to
promote the engraftment of transplanted NPCs after SCI result-
ing in enhanced functional recovery. For ESC-derivedNPCs, Hart-
mann et al. [44] showed that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays a key
role inmigration after transplantation intomouse hippocampus,
which raises the possibility that SDF-1 is also sufficient for target-
ing grafted ESC-derived NPCs in the injured spinal cord.
Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from Bone Marrow or
Umbilical Cord Blood
Transplantedmesenchymal stemcells (MSCs) derived fromadult
bone marrow or umbilical cord blood migrate to the acute or
subacute spinal cord lesion site and enhance regeneration [45–
47]. Migration of MSCs is under the control of a large range of
growth factors, such asHGF [48, 49] andCC andCXC chemokines.
SDF-1 inducesmigration ofMSCs in vitro, but with limited effect,
as growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and plate-
let-derived growth factor-AB are more potent chemoattractants
[50, 51]. Blocking of the SDF-1/CXCR12 axis does not inhibit mi-
gration completely, indicating that additionalmolecules regulate
MSC migration [52]. Interestingly, migration of MSCs might de-
pend on the inflammatory state as tumor necrosis factor- and
interferon- upregulate the expression of CXCR4, which, in turn,
leads to increased MSC migration toward SDF-1 [51, 53]. On the
other hand, transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) downregu-
lates the expression of CXCR4 in MSCs, resulting in reduced mi-
gration capacity [54]. The incubation ofMSCswith SDF-1 leads to
an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleu-
kin-6 and regeneration-associated molecules such as leukemia
inhibitory factor [55], which could have an impact on inflamma-
tion and regeneration. Moreover, SDF-1 could promote survival
of transplanted MSCs, as pretreatment of MSCs with SDF-1 re-
sults in enhanced survival after oxidative stress in vitro and an
increased secretion of prosurvival and angiogenesis-promoting
factors [56].
In contrast, other authors reported that a population of
CD34 adult bone marrow-derived stem cells do not express

functional CXCR4 [57], or only a small proportion of MSCs ex-
press functionally active CXCR4 [58], which reflects the contro-
versial definition of theMSC. Unfortunately, a specific molecular
marker definingMSCs has yet to be found [59]. On the one hand,
human umbilical cord blood (hUCB)-derived MSCs migrate to-
ward SDF-1 gradients [60] via Akt, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase, and p38 transduction pathways. On the other hand, a
subpopulation of stem cells from hUCB (unrestricted somatic
stem cells) migrate to SC injury sites mainly driven by HGF gradi-
ents [61].
MSCs are known to secrete SDF-1, which has been shown to
enhance neurite growth on inhibitory myelin [62] and in the
presence of Semaphorin 3A/3C [63] in vitro, as well as axonal
sprouting in vivo [7, 62]. In addition, transplanted MSCs could
influenceglial scarringbystimulatingastrocyteproliferation [64], as
well as survival of endogenous neural progenitor cells invading the
lesion spinal cord, as MSC-secreted SDF-1 protects neural progeni-
tor cells during hypoxia through activation of CXCR7 [43].
EFFECT OF SDF-1 ON REMYELINATION
SCI leads to a dramatic loss of oligodendrocytes, resulting in de-
myelinated “naked” axons near the lesion that are vulnerable
and nonfunctional [65]. Protection of oligodendrocytes from
death or promotion of remyelination by endogenous oligoden-
drocyte precursor cells (OPCs) might be a possibility to enhance
functional regeneration. SCI elicits rapid proliferation of OPCs
throughout the gray and white matter in both adult rodent and
primate spinal cord [65, 66], as well as of ependymal cells sur-
rounding the central canal,which also could give rise to oligoden-
drocytes after injury [17]. The robust proliferation response that
is followed bymigration of OPCs into the injury site indicates the
presence of local chemoattractants. SDF-1 might function as
such a factor in SCI, as the receptor CXCR4 is expressed by pri-
mary neonatal OPCs [24] and by neuron glial antigen 2-positive
subpial cells (a marker for OPCs) early after SCI [8]. Indeed, it has
been shown that SDF-1 increases CXCR4-dependent OPC sur-
vival, migration [24], and proliferation in vitro [67]. Moreover,
CXCR4-deficient mice show defective OPC survival and ventral
to dorsal migration in the embryonic spinal cord. These find-
ings support the idea that manipulation of SDF-1 could speed
up recruitment, as well as enhancing OPC survival and prolif-
eration following SCI.
OPC differentiate into oligodendrocytes, which could remy-
elinate axons starting in the subacute phase at 2 weeks postin-
jury. Thus, boosting proper differentiation of resident precursor
cells would enhance CNS remyelination. Two groups have shown
that SDF-1 promotesOPCmaturation andmyelin production [68,
69]. However, in these studies with different models of demyeli-
nation different receptors responsible for OPC maturation have
been identified: CXCR4 in cuprizone-mediated demyelination of
the corpus callosum [68], and CXCR7 in experimental autoim-
mune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the spinal cord [69]. It should
be noted that because of the recent discovery of CXCR7 as a
second SDF-1/CXCL12 receptor [70], earlier studies have investi-
gated only SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling. Therefore, it still needs to be
determined which SDF-1/CXCL12 receptor is required for oligo-
dendrocytematuration following SCI. If the receptor responsible

for OPC differentiation is CXCR7, then CXCR7-specific small mol-
ecule-based activators could promote remyelination without in-
terference with immune cells, which in adult mammals do not
express CXCR7 [44, 71].
CONTROVERSIAL FUNCTION OF SDF-1 IN THE WOUND HEALING
RESPONSE
A fibrotic glial scar forms during the first week after traumatic SCI
and seals the blood-spinal cord barrier. The collagen-rich lesion
scar is considered a major impediment for axon regeneration,
and several strategies suppressing scar formation have been
shown to increase axon regrowth into the lesion site and beyond
[72, 73]. Thus far it is not known whether SDF-1 influences scar
formation. Intriguingly, SDF-1was reported to act antifibrotically
in the infarcted heart [74], as the adenovirus-mediated transduc-
tion of the infarcted heart with SDF-1 in the acute stage led to
decreased TGF-1 expression, which, in turn, led to reduced col-
lagen accumulation in the infarcted area [74]. Similarly, in an-
other study, acute transplantation of lentivirally SDF-1-infected
endothelial progenitor cells revealed a lower collagen content in
the infarctedmyocardium [75]. On the other hand, SDF-1/CXCR4
signaling has been implicated in promoting migration of acti-
vated CD14 CXCR4 peripheral blood mononuclear cells to
wound sites, where they might differentiate into fibrocytes
and myofibroblasts, thus contributing to the development of
a hypertrophic scar [76]. In line with this, depletion of SDF-1 in
a mouse model of sickle cell disease resulted in a marked
reduction of fibrocyte trafficking into the lungs, resulting in
reduced lung collagen content and improved lung compliance
[77]. Therefore, it still remains to be investigated whether
SDF-1 acts antifibrotically or contributes to scar formation in
SCI.
NEOVASCULARIZATION
After SCI, endothelial cells and blood vessels degenerate during
the first days, exacerbating hemorrhage and tissue ischemia
[78]. In addition, SCI leads to breakdown of the blood-spinal cord
barrier (BSCB) with the influx of ions, neurotoxic substances, and
inflammatory cells, all contributing to secondary damage [79]. A
robust angiogenic response is observed 3–14 days after injury
[78]. The formation of new vessels to deliver oxygen and nutri-
ents is considered vital for neuronal regeneration and functional
recovery, as shown in a number of models of SCI, where the
treatments increased blood vessel density [80–82]. The aim of
the therapies is to stimulate angiogenesis without excessive vas-
cular permeability and restoration of the BSCB in the subacute
phase after SCI. The crucial role of SDF-1/CXCR4 in embryonic
vasculogenesis is shown by blood vessel abnormalities mani-
fested in SDF-1a/ and CXCR4/ mice [5]. Interestingly, the
CXCR7 knockout mouse showed disrupted cardiac development
[2], indicating that SDF-1/CXCR7 signaling could play a special
role in endothelial biology [83].
Hypoxia induces expression of SDF-1 [84], which is likely one
mechanism by which hypoxia drives neovascularization. Indeed,
application of SDF-1 promotes neovascularization after trau-
matic brain injury (TBI) [85], after stroke [86], and in ischemic
tissues [87]. After TBI, injection of SDF-1 into the brain penumbra
at the acute stage increased the microvessel density around the
injured area, whereas application of a SDF-1 neutralizing anti-
body significantly decreased spontaneous neovascularization
[85]. Similarly to TBI, in a strokemodel, intracerebral administra-
tion of SDF-1 in acute phase increased vascular density and con-
sequently enhanced functional local cerebral blood flow in the
penumbra and hippocampus. In both studies, significant im-
provement of neurological function upon SDF-1 application
was found, which might be partially caused by an angiogenic
effect [86]. It remains to be studied whether application of
SDF-1 into the lesion area could improve microcirculation and
restore the BSCB with proper morphology after SCI. In addi-
tion, SDF-1 might engage itself in neurovascular niche simi-
larly to brain [88].
The likely mechanism of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis enhancing
neovascularization comprises the attraction of endogenous
CXCR4 endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) or pericyte progeni-
tors [89] to the injury site. It has been demonstrated that resi-
dent microvascular CD133 pericytes show a corresponding
trend with SDF-1 levels following SCI [90]. Additionally, rat MSCs
that were engineered to overexpress CXCR4 and intravenously
infused were recruited at significantly higher numbers and in-
creased the capillary vascular volume of the peri-infarct area
after stroke [91].
STRATEGIES TO MANIPULATE THE SDF-1/CXCR4 AXIS TO
ENHANCE RECOVERY AFTER SCI
The SDF-1/CXCR4 axis has not beenmanipulated in humans after
SCI. Moreover, the expression pattern of SDF-1 and CXCR4/
CXCR7 has to be analyzed in detail in humans after SCI. However,
the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis has been experimentally manipulated in
different ways: SDF-1 has been intrathecally infused with mini-
pumps [62] or scaffolds have been transplanted releasing SDF-1
over periods of up to 7 days [92]. Additionally, local transfection
with SDF-1 plasmids [93] and transplantation of SDF-1- or CXCR4-
overexpressing cells [91] have been used. The latter approach
might have advantages as frequently passaged cells downregu-
late CXCR4 expression [56]. Transplantation of cells constitu-
tively secreting SDF-1 enclosed in microcapsules would be an
alternative. Importantly, the short half-life of SDF-1 due to rapid
degradation/inactivation by proteases at the injury site and in
the blood is even less than half an hour [94]. Therefore, SDF-1
applied in solution should contain a carrier protein to increase its
stability. An alternative for SDF-1 would be the newly developed
small peptide analogs with improved bioavailability, higher sta-
bility, and comparable or even increased functionality [87,
95–97].
On the other hand, strategies enhancing SDF-1/CXCR4 sig-
naling might counteract the limited time of SDF-1 action in tis-
sues. For example, priming of human bone marrow CD34 stem
cells with complement cleavage fragments enhanced their hom-
ing in a murine transplant model [98], because cells respond
robustly even to very low SDF-1 gradients in the presence of
priming factors [99]. Moreover, low levels of TGF-1 can modu-
late SDF-1 responsiveness [100]. Interestingly, pretreatment of
cells with SDF-1 increases their homing after transplantation as
shown, for example, for human cardiac mesoangioblasts trans-
planted into the heart [101].
Under physiological conditions, SDF-1 readily changes be-
tweenmonomeric and dimeric states that influence its action.
735Jaerve, Schira, Müller

However, there is some discrepancy between published re-
sults. It was reported that SDF-1 dimers, which preferentially
form at higher concentrations, halt cell migration, whereas
monomers promote chemotaxis in vivo [102]. In contrast, Ray
et al. [103] found that dimeric SDF-1 more effectively pro-
motes chemotaxis of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells.
Although CXCR7 preferentially sequestered monomeric SDF-1
from the extracellular space, it had minimal effects on dimeric
SDF-1 [103]. Importantly, at high concentrations, SDF-1 repels
many CXCR4-expressing cell types [104]. Since SDF-1 in-
creases the vascular permeability, therapeutic dosages of
SDF-1 need to be adjusted carefully in clinical applications [86,
105]. Nonetheless, acute intracerebral administration of
SDF-1 did not alter physiological parameters such as systemic
blood pressure, blood gases, blood glucose, or serum electro-
lyte levels [86].
Manipulation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis could be beneficial for
acute or subacute stages as it has an impact on early processes
after SCI, such as inflammation andneovascularization, aswell as
creating an environment for axon regeneration. In fact, most of
the stem/progenitor cell transplantations have been conducted
in acute or subacute phase of SCI, as the transplanted cells sur-
vive best at this stage and transplantation into the chronic SCI
does not lead to functional recovery (at least in rodents). In
chronic stages, the beneficial effects might be weaker. It is likely
that incomplete SCI would profit more than complete regardless
of the injury level.
TUMORIGENIC POTENCY AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN
In addition to stem cells, SDF-1 might mobilize transformed
stem cells (cancer stem cells) [106]. Most tumors are, indeed,
CXCR4 and tend to metastasize to the bones and lymph
nodes that highly express SDF-1 in an SDF-1-dependent man-
ner [107]. Although there is no evidence that local application
of SDF-1 would increase tumor incidence, systematic evalua-
tion is a basic prerequisite for clinical translation of SDF-1.
SDF-1 could potentially modulate sensitivity following SCI.
When injected into the adult rat hind paw, SDF-1 produces dose-
dependent tactile allodynia by directly exciting nociceptive dor-
sal root ganglia neurons that express CXCR4 [108]. Knerlich-Lu-
koschus et al. [109] reported a correlation between increased
SDF-1 immunoreactivity in the dorsal column and dorsal horns
with lowering of thermal and mechanical thresholds on spinal
cord level L3–L5 at 6 weeks post-SCI, whereas there was no cor-
relation of increased CXCR4 immunoreactivity in the dorsal
horns with the nociceptive thresholds [109]. However, in our
experiments, we did not observe signs of extra hypersensitivity
by postoperative care of rats, which had received SDF-1 infusion
for 1 week and were observed for 4 months. Clearly, it should be
investigated whether application of SDF-1 into the spinal cord
would change nociception following SCI, but application of SDF-1
in a long-term approach to the spinal cord is not likely to be
feasible because of potential oncogenic characteristics.
STIMULATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE
SDF-1 was shown to be involved in macrophage infiltration into
the spinal cord lesion site, as application of the CXCR4 inhibitor
AMD3100 reduced the influx of myeloid cells by 28%–30% [110].
Additionally, Tysseling et al. [6] observed massive infiltration of
CXCR4macrophages in green fluorescence protein-CXCR4mice
following SCI, which also appeared to secrete SDF-1 [6, 111].
None of these studies, however, distinguished among the proin-
flammatoryM1 or anti-inflammatoryM2macrophage subtypes.
Importantly, M2 macrophages show expression levels of CXCR4
16 times as high as those ofM1macrophages [112], suggesting a
higher responsiveness to SDF-1. If so, infusion of SDF-1 into the
acute or subacute injury site might enable selective modulation
of inflammatory responses in SCI.
CONCLUSION
SDF-1,which is upregulated at the site of traumatic spinal cord or
brain injury, has been shown to be crucial for the recruitment of
transplanted stem cells and endogenous progenitor cells to pro-
mote functional recovery. It remains to be investigated whether
grafting cells in combination with SDF-1 application would result
in synergistic promotion of recruitment of both endogenous and
transplanted stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, SDF-1 can di-
rectly drive the proliferation, survival, and maturation of OPC
and EPCs to promote remyelination and neovascularization, re-
spectively.Moreover, it has been shown that SDF-1 directly stim-
ulates axon growth in vitro and in damaged spinal cord. There is
a substantial amount of supporting data about SDF-1 in CNS con-
ditions such as stroke, TBI, and EAE. However, many of the find-
ings remain to be shown in SCI. SDF-1 ismore likely tomanipulate
the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in acute or subacute stages than in chronic
stages, as this manipulation has an impact on early processes
after SCI, such as neovascularization and remyelination.
Whether SDF-1 application could promote functional recovery in
chronic SCI has to be investigated. It is crucial to systematically
evaluate potential hazards (neuropathic pain, tumorigenicity)
that might go along with long-term application of SDF-1. None-
theless, tumorigenic potency could be overcome, for example,
by transplantation ofmodified stemcells, overexpressing CXCR4,
which were reported showing increased recruitment compared
to controls. Only the accomplishment of the crucial studies will
allow full assessment of the clinical potential of SDF-1 in SCI.
