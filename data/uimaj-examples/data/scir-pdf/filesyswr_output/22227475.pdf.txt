e lscritical mechanism responsible for the progression of neurodegenera-
tion (Brown and Neher, 2010; Minghetti, 2005). Brain inflammation
is characterized by glial cell activation accompanied by production
of oxygen free radicals and other inflammation-related products
that are toxic to neurons. Accumulating evidence has shown that in-
duction of the inflammation-related enzymes such as inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxgenase(COX)-2 are critical mecha-
nisms by which inflammatory cells contribute to the development of
cerebral damage under various pathologic conditions. Indeed, exper-
iments using iNOS and COX-2 inhibitors suggest that inflammation-
been attributed to the maintenance of ATP levels (Cardenas et al.,
2000; Espanol et al., 1998) and the reduction of glutamate (Bickler
and Buck, 1996) and oxidative stress (Park et al., 2004; Vexler et al.,
2003). Other possible mechanisms have also been suggested, includ-
ing calcium chelation (Bickler and Kelleher, 1992), antagonism of
NMDA receptors (Izumi et al., 2003) and modulation of second mes-
senger systems (Donohoe et al., 2001; Fahlman et al., 2002; Song
et al., 2005). However, mechanisms whereby FBP protects the brain
have not been fully elucidated yet.
In this context, it is important to note that FBP has anti-

addition, FBP is known to inhibit the production of inflammatory me-

prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Ahn et al., 2002) and nitric oxide (NO)

cated in the neuroprotective actions of FBP. Thus, in this study, in
order to better understand the neuroprotective mechanism of FBP
in situations related to brain disease, we investigated whether FBP in-
hibits endotoxin-induced NO production and iNOS expression in
microglial cells and explored the possible mechanisms of the effects
of FBP.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), 6-
hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox),
pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), actinomycin D and lipopolysac-
charide (LPS) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). MAPKs in-
hibitors, such as SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK inhibitor),
and SB202190 (p38 inhibitor), were obtained from Calbiochem (San
Diego, CA). [α-32P] dCTP was purchased from DuPont-NEN (Boston,
MA).
Cell cultures
BV2 cells, the murine microglial cell line originally developed by
Dr. V. Bocchini at University of Perugia (Blasi et al., 1990), were gen-
erously provided by Dr. E.H. Joe at Ajou University (Suwon, Korea).
The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10%
FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin
at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
Primary murine microglial cell isolation
Primary microglia cell cultures were prepared from prenatal day
1–2 ICR mouse (Daehan Biolink, Korea) brains. Briefly, the neonatal
mouse was anesthetized with ethyl ether. And the cortices were me-
chanically dissociated with a flamed-polished Pasteur pipette in MEM
supplemented with 20 mM glucose. Cell were plated on 6 or 24 multi-
well plates with culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, and 0.01 μg/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
for 24 h. The medium was changed every 3 days after seeding. The
cells reached to confluence on day 14. 14-day mixed glial cell cultures
were agitated on an orbital shaker for 4 h at 250 rpm at 37 °C. The su-
pernatant was collected, and microglia were filtered through a 32-μm
nylon mesh. Microglia were incubated on uncoated petri dishes in a
moist 10% CO2 atmosphere for 20 min at 37 °C to allow microglia
cells to attach.
Nitric oxide (NO) assay
NO production was determined by measuring nitrite, a stable ox-
idation product of NO, as described previously (Green et al., 1982).
Nitrite concentration in the medium was spectrophotometrically
measured by Griess reaction. The culture medium was mixed with
an equal volume of Griess reagent (0.1% naphthyl-ethylenediamine
hydrochloride and 1% sulfanilamide in 10% phosphoric acid) and in-
cubated at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance was measured
at 540 nm in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA). Sodium nitrite was used as a standard.
Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for iNOS
Total RNA was extracted from the samples with Easy-blue kit®
(Intron, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ali-
quots of total RNA (1 μg) were transcribed using AMV reverse tran-
scriptase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). Primer sequenceswere as follows: iNOS, sense, 5′-CGTGTGCCTGCTGCCTTCCTGCTGT-3′;
antisense, 5′-GTAATCCTCAACCTGCTCCTCACTC-3′; GAPDH, sense, 5′-
GTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CACAGTCTTC TGAGTG
GCAGTGAT-3′.
PCR amplification of the resulting cDNA template was conducted
using the following conditions: iNOS; 28 cycles of denaturing at
94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C
for 1 min; GAPDH; 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 0.5 min,
annealing at 60 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Reac-
tion products were then separated on a 2% agarose gel and photo-
graphed under ultraviolet light. The optical density was determined
by a Gel doc system (GEL DOC 2000, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of
iNOS expression and the activation of MAPKs. After treatment, cell ly-
sates were prepared by scraping BV2 cells in the lysis buffer (Tris
50 mM at pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Tween-20, 10 μM leupeptin, and
1 mM phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride) and sonicating for 10–15 s
(20-W pulses). Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein
were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to ni-
trocellulose membranes and subsequently blocked in T-TBS buffer
(20 mM Tris buffer; 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20) containing 5% non-
fat dried milk. Blots were incubated with polyclonal anti-iNOS (Up-
state biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, 1:2,000), MAPKs (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, 1:1,000) or GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and followed by incubation with a
horse radish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Bio-
technology, 1:10,000). The blots were visualized using an ECL chemi-
luminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
Luciferase assay
Luciferase assay was carried out using a kit from Promega (Madi-
son, WI). piNOS-luc reporter construct, which contains the murine
iNOS promoter in pGL3 vector was provided by Dr. D. Hwang at UC
Davis, USA. Cells in 24 well plates were transfected with piNOS-Luc
and pCMV-β-gal plasmid as an internal control using Lipofectamine™
2000 reagent (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) for 24 h and transfected-cells
were treated with different agents (triplicate wells each) for 5 h. Cells
were then lysed by adding 100 μl of lysis buffer, sonicated for 10 s and
centrifuged in a tabletop microcentrifuge. An aliquot (20 μl) was
mixed with 100 μl of assay reagent, vortexed, and read immediately
in a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). The
luciferase activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity and
expressed as % of treatment-free control.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear proteins (10 μg) were used for the electrophoretic mobil-
ity shift assay for the detection of the DNA binding activity of AP-1,
NF-κB, CREB, and C/EBP. DNA-protein binding reactions were per-
formed at room temperature for 20 min in 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH
7.9; 10% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT and 10 μM leupeptin, plus 1 μg of poly
(dI-dC) and ~0.3 pmol of labeled double-stranded sequences for AP-
1, NF-κB, CREB or C/EBP binding. The following oligonucleotides
were synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea) and labeled with
[α-32P] dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 250 μCi/25 μl); 5′-AGCTTGGGGACTTT-
CC-3′, containing a binding site for NF-κB complexes; 5′-CGCTTGAT-
GAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′, containing a binding site for AP-1 complexes;
5′-GATCGTCACCACTACGTCACGTGGAGTCCGCTT-5′, containing a bind-
ing site for CRE/E-box complexes; and 5′-GATCCTGCCGCTGCGGTT-
CTTGCGCAACTCACT-3′ containing a binding site for CREB complexes.
The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide

pH 8.0). The gel was run at 200 V for 2 h at 5 °C. Gels were then dried
and subjected to autoradiography at−80 °C with Kodak TGM/RA film.
Measurement of ROS release
Intracellular ROS was measured fluorometrically using the non-
fluorescent dye, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), which
easily permeates cells and is hydrolyzed to fluorescent 2′,7′-dichloro-
fluorescein (DCF) upon interaction with intracellular ROS. Cells were
loaded with 20 μM of DCF-DA and 20% Pluronic F-127 for 30 min and
then washed with HCSS. The DCF fluorescence was analyzed using a
fluorescence plate reader (Luminescence spectrometer-55, Perkin
Elmer, Wellesley, MA) at an excitation of 490 nm and an emission
of 530 nm.
GSSG/GSH assay
Total glutathione (GSH plus GSSG) was determined by photomet-
ric determination of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate, formed from 5,5′-dithio-
bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid, DTNB) at 405 nm according to the protocol of
Akerboom and Sies (1981). The assay mixture was 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM 5,5′-
dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.4 mM NADPH, and 1 U/ml glutathi-
one reductase and 10 μl of cell lysate. The increase in absorbance at
405 nm was monitored at 15 s intervals for 2.5 min using a micro
plate reader (VERSAmax, Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA). GSSG
was quantified after derivatizing GSH in the sample with 2-
vinylpyridine for 1 h. After incubation, 10 μl of the each sample was
assayed as described above using similarly treated GSSG standards
(0–5 μM).

Results
Fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBP) reduces bacterial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced NO production and iNOS expression
In order to characterize the nature of the anti-inflammatory action
of FBP, we examined its effects on the production of NO in BV2 micro-
glial cells. When treated with LPS at concentrations up to 1 μg/ml for
24 h, microglial cells released NO in a concentration-dependent man-
ner. Thus, cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml of LPS in the subsequent
experiments. LPS reduced the cell viability by 24% compared to the
control group. Recovery of cell viability was observed upon treatment
with FBP, and a maximal effect of FBP was observed at 10 mM (105.5±
2.7% of control). FBP reduced the accumulated levels of NO in the
media in a dose-dependent manner when added to the culture
media 30 min prior to LPS stimulation (Fig. 1A). The inhibitory effect
of FBP on NO production was maximal at 10 mM. Experiments with
primary cultured mouse microglia showed similar results (Fig. 1A
inset). LPS-induced iNOS expression was significantly suppressed by
FBP at both the mRNA and the protein level (Fig. 1C). Antioxidants,
such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 mM) and pyrrolidine dithiocarba-
mate (PDTC, 50 μM) attenuated LPS-induced NO production and
iNOS expression (Fig. 1B, D). The effect of FBP on both the protein
ed from primary murine microglial cells are shown in inset of (A). The data represent

andmRNA levels of iNOS could bedue to decreased transcription and/or
reduced mRNA stability. FBP significantly inhibited LPS-induced
transcriptional activation of the iNOS promoter (Fig. 2A, 285.0±
9.0% and 115.1±6.1% of control in LPS alone and LPS plus FBP
(10 mM), respectively). To examine the stability of iNOSmRNA, actino-
mycin D was added to cells after 4 h of LPS treatment and the level of
iNOS mRNA was measured from the time of addition up to 8 h. The
iNOS transcript completely decayed by 8 h of post-actinomycin D
treatment. The mRNA decay was significantly reversed by treatment
with FBP (Fig. 2B).
Effects of FBP on DNA binding of transcription factors
Previous studies have suggested that various transcription factors,
such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), cAMP response element-
binding protein (CREB), activator protein (AP-1) and CCAAT/enhanc-
er binding protein (C/EBP), are important regulators of the expression
of iNOS gene expression (Kleinert et al., 2004). The DNA binding ac-
tivities of all these transcription factors increased upon LPS treatment
in microglial cells. FBP diminished the binding of AP-1, but did not af-
fect DNA binding of NF-κB, CREB and C/EBP (Fig. 3). Antioxidants,
such as NAC (10 mM) and PDTC (50 μM), also attenuated AP-1 bind-
ing activity. Binding of these transcription factors to specific DNA sites

FBP inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression by blocking JNK/p38 MAPK
MAPK signaling pathways play a critical role in the regulation of
inflammatory response and the coordination of the induction of vari-
ous inflammatory mediators (Guha and Mackman, 2001). As shown
in Fig. 4A, LPS markedly induced the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK
and p38 kinase, and FBP suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of
all of these MAPKs.
To determine which MAPK signaling pathway is involved in LPS-
induced iNOS expression, cells were pretreated for 30 min with
MAPK-specific inhibitors (PD98059 for MEK1/2, SB203580 for p38 ki-
nase and SP600125 for JNK) before exposure to LPS. SP60015 and
SB203580 significantly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression and
NO production, while PD98059 showed minimal effect, if any
(Fig. 4B and C). These data suggest that LPS-induced iNOS expression
appears to be regulated by JNK and p38 kinase, but not by ERK in BV2
microglial cells. Thus, the suppression of JNK and p38 kinase phos-
phorylation may be associated with the inhibitory effect of FBP on
iNOS expression.
The involvement of the MAPK pathway in regulating LPS-
mediated iNOS expression has been hypothesized to be redox-
dependent (Kim et al., 2004; Pawate et al., 2004). In the present
study, we also observed that antioxidants, NAC (10 mM) and PDTC
(50 μM), inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38 ki-
nase (Fig. 4A) and reduced NO production (25.6±0.4 and 16.6±
0.3 μM in the LPS control and in the NAC treated cells, respectively).
FBP reduces LPS-induced ROS production
In order to determine whether FBP reduces oxidative stress under
our experimental conditions, we measured the fluorescence intensity
of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), an oxidant sensitive dye, and the cel-
lular oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) ratio.
The fluorescence intensity of each sample was expressed as the per-
centage over the vehicle-treated control. The level of ROS increased in
a time-dependent manner, peaking at 4 h after LPS treatment. FBP re-
duced LPS-induced ROSproduction (Fig. 5A) and also decreased the cel-
lular GSSG/GSH ratio at 4 h after stimulation (Fig. 5B).
Discussion
The present study shows that FBP inhibits the induction of NO
production and diminished iNOS expression in BV2 microglia ex-
posed to LPS. FBP has been known to inhibit iNOS expression in
oxygen-glucose-deprived (OGD) rat forebrain slices (Cardenas et al.,
2000) and macrophages stimulated with LPS (Edde et al., 1998).
However, the underlying mechanism of FBP action has not yet been
elucidated in detail. Previous reports have shown that the expression
of iNOS is regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional
levels (Amin et al., 1997; Nathan and Xie, 1994). Our results show
that FBP hindered LPS-induced transcriptional activation of the iNOS
promoter (Fig. 2A). Among the tested transcription factors activated
by LPS, only AP-1 binding activity was attenuated by FBP (Fig. 3).
Though NF-κB is the most important transcription factor in LPS-
induced transcriptional activation of iNOS, FBP did not affect NF-κB
binding in our study. This result coincides with a previous study
showing that FBP did not affect NF-κB binding activity in macro-
phages stimulated with LPS (Edde et al., 1998). Based on this result,
they speculated that FBP might enhance iNOS mRNA degradation in
macrophages. However, our results indicate that this is not the case
at least in BV2 microglial cells. FBP increased the stability of the
iNOS transcript in microglia, which apparently conflicts with above
data supporting the inhibitory effect of FBP at transcriptional level.

NF-κBHowever, our data clearly shows that FBP reduces the total levels of
iNOS mRNA induced by LPS. Thus, it is strongly suggested that tran-
scriptional effect of FBP is the main one in determining iNOS mRNA
levels under our experimental condition.
MAPK signaling pathways are well known to be critically involved
in the iNOS gene expression. In the present study, we observed that
specific inhibitors of JNK and p38 kinase inhibited LPS-induced pro-
duction of NO and the expression of iNOS. These data suggest key
roles for these kinase cascades in LPS-induced microglial activation.
However ERK kinase did not seem to be involved in the LPS-
induced iNOS gene expression (Fig. 4). These results are in accor-
dance with a previous report suggesting p38 kinase, but not ERK ki-
nase, is an important mediator of iNOS induction by LPS in BV2
microglia (Han et al., 2002). In addition, these results are supported
by the fact that the promoter regions of the genes encoding iNOS
have binding site for the JNK-dependent transcription factor AP-1. In-
deed, FBP suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of all three
MAPKs and AP-1 binding activity. Taken together, these data suggest
that the suppression of JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation might be
associated with the inhibitory effect of FBP on LPS-induced iNOS gene
expression. However, it should be pointed out that there are some in-
consistent reports on the role of MAPKs in iNOS gene expression.

CREBThough our findings are consistent with a previous study of C-6 glio-
ma cells in terms of dissociation of ERK activation and iNOS expres-
sion (Nishiya et al., 1997), they differ from those of other studies
with myocytes (Singh et al., 1996), primary rat microglial cells
(Bhat et al., 1998) and even BV2 microglia (Bae et al., 2006), in
which ERK pathway is involved in the expression of iNOS. These con-
tradictions probably stem from the well-known, but not well-
understood, complex regulation of iNOS gene expression, which is
cell type-, species-, and stimulus-specific.
Accumulating evidence indicates that oxidative components con-
tribute to LPS-induced iNOS expression (Kim et al., 2004; Pawate
et al., 2004). Indeed, several putative sequences for ROS sensitive
transcription factors have been identified in the 5′-upstream region
of the iNOS gene, including sites for NF-κB, NF-IL6 and AP-1
(Kleinert et al., 2004). Consequently, the management of cellular
ROS levels could be regarded as a key to the regulation of iNOS ex-
pression. FBP has been shown to suppress ROS production by neutro-
phils, keratinocytes and cortical neurons and preserve the
antioxidative capacities in cortical neurons and skin during oxidative
stress (Ahn et al., 2002, 2007; Park et al., 2004). In the present study,
we show that FBP reduced ROS production and maintained glutathi-
one in microglia during LPS stimulation. FBP is known to suppress

in vitro hydroxyl radical generation in Fenton reaction (Tang et al.,
2008) and also preserve cellular antioxidative capacity by stimulating
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Vexler et al., 2003). In addi-
tion, we reported that FBP reduced NMDA-induced ROS production
by downregulation of the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 kinase in
cortical neurons (Park et al., 2004). Thus, together with the suppres-
sive effects of antioxidants, such as NAC and PDTC, against NO pro-
duction and phosphorylation of MAPKs (Fig. 4), these results
support the inference that the antioxidative property of FBP is associ-
ated with inhibition of MAPKs and thereby attenuation of iNOS ex-
pression in microglia exposed to LPS.
FBP has been reported to have neuroprotective effects in various
brain injury models, including hypoxia–ischemia (Farias et al., 1990;
Kaakinen et al., 2006; Kuluz et al., 1993; Sola et al., 1996; Trimarchi
et al., 1997; Vexler et al., 2003), seizure (Stringer and Xu, 2008),
β-amyloid induced neurotoxicity (Song et al., 2005) and insulin-
induced hypoglycemia (Farias et al., 1989). One of the main hypothe-
ses for these effects is that FBP serves as a glycolytic intermediate and
alters metabolic production of ATP under pathologic conditions
(Bickler and Buck, 1996; Cardenas et al., 2000; Espanol et al., 1998;
Hardin and Roberts, 1994; Juergens and Hardin, 1996). In support of
this hypothesis, recent report demonstrated that the levels of FBP sig-
nificantly increased in brain after intraperitoneal and oral administra-
tion and exogenous FBP was taken up into cells within brain and not
trapped in the endothelial cells of the brain (Xu and Stringer, 2008). It
was shown that FBP could cross lipid bilayers by passive diffusion
(Ehringer et al., 2000) or via a dicarboxylate transport system
(Hardin et al., 2001).
In contrast, several other reports showed FBP failed to preserve
ATP in in vivo and in vitro models of hypoxia or ischemia (Hofer
et al., 2009; Kelleher et al., 1995; Liu et al., 2008). It was speculated
that the lack of its effect on energy metabolism was probably because
it was prevented from entering cells in adequate quantities. On the
basis of these results, it has been suggested that mechanisms other
than augmented carbohydrate metabolism are responsible for previ-
ous reports of neuronal protection by FBP (Hofer et al., 2009). Indeed,
the protective role of FBP has been attributed to a variety of mecha-

2003), calcium chelation (Bickler and Kelleher, 1992) and antagonism
of NMDA receptors (Izumi et al., 2003). In addition, FBP initiates a se-
ries of neuroprotective signals, including phospholipase C (PLC) acti-
vation and increased activity of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway
(Fahlman et al., 2002; Song et al., 2005) and up-regulates the expres-
sion of APE/Ref-1, an enzyme responsible for the repair of DNA (Long
et al., 2002). Most of these regulatory processes would be expected to
require lesser concentrations of FBP compared to the provision of
substrate for energy metabolism (Hofer et al., 2009). Regardless of
whether FBP has an extra- or intracellular site of action, currently a
matter of controversy, accumulated evidence indicates that FBP has
cytoprotective effects under various pathological conditions.
Induction of iNOS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain
injury (del Zoppo et al., 2000; Ono et al., 2010; Pannu and Singh,
2006). Indeed, experiments have shown that selective inhibitors of
iNOS are effective in preventing ischemic injury in brain (ArunaDevi
et al., 2010; Cardenas et al., 1998; Greco et al., 2011). In this context,
it was suggested that FBP might abolish iNOS expression by reducing
glutamate release in oxygen-glucose-deprived rat forebrain slices and
the beneficial effects of FBP were possibly associated with decreased
production of NO (Cardenas et al., 2000). These results were obtained
from organotypic slice culture and there was no description of the
specific cell types therein involved. Activated microglia are involved
in the progression of brain injury and neuroinflammation mediated
by microglia has been regarded as a pathological hallmark of various
CNS disorder (Brown and Neher, 2010). However, until this time,
there has been no report describing the effect of FBP on microglial
cells. Our data clearly showed that FBP could directly affect microglia
and attenuate the LPS-induced iNOS. To our knowledge, our study is
the first report to focus on microglial activation, and thereby adding
the attenuation of neuroinflammation to the repertoire of neuropro-
tective mechanism of FBP.
Conclusion
In this study, we showed FBP, a glycolytic intermediate, exerts
anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting LPS-induced NO production
and iNOS expression in microglial cells. This effect is mediated by
suppression of JNK and p38 MAPK, which might be related to ROS
downregulation. This study suggests that the attenuation of micro-
glial activation and in turn, neuroinflammation is implicated in the
neuroprotective mechanism of FBP.
