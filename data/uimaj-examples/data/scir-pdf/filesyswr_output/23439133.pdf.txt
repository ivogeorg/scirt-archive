evidences support that microenvironment can play a vital role in
determining the properties of stem cells [9], suggesting that
stem cell microenvironment might play an important role in cell
typical neurospheres in suspension. Sphere-for

stem cells can be maintained in culture as flopacity into specialized cell types endows stem cells with great
promise for scientific research and therapeutic applications. Previ-
ous works demonstrated that pluripotent stem cells can be gen-
erated from somatic cells via overexpression of key transcription
factors, creating a new method for cell reprogramming [1,2]. Since
then, great efforts have been devoted to designing safer and more
efficient methods for cell reprogramming, such as the utilization of
[9,11e15]. Many 3D cell culture models have been established
including the use of porous scaffolds, hydrogels or polymers. 3D self-
organized cellular sphere is another typical 3D cell culture system
taking advantage of the natural aggregation tendency of many cell
types. Previous studies demonstrated sphere formation may be
related to stemness since pluripotent cells tend to exhibit a sphere or
colony morphology. For example, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) formLow attachment surface

approaches. The first one is hanging drop method that spheres are
grown in droplets placed on an inverted plate [22]. The second is
gyratory rotation technique that trypsinized cells are cultured in
a stirred flask to prevent them from adhering to the substrate [23].
The third one is low-attachment cultivation of cells on hydrophobic
surface [24]. In this work, we prepared low attachment surface by
coating soft agarose on cell culture dish, and performed 3D sphere
culture of human urinary bladder papilloma cell line RT4 and hu-
man embryonic kidney epithelial cell line HEK293, representing
cancer and non-cancerous cells respectively. Compared with con-
ventional 2D culture, 3D sphere culture promoted the expression of
reprogramming factors. Sphere formation of RT4 cells induced
cancer stem cells characteristics including higher SP cell percentage,
higher metastasis ability and higher tumorigenicity. HEK293
spheres showed upregulation of kidney progenitor cell markers and
partially acquired characteristics of ESCs including upregulation of
alkaline phosphatase activity, ES cell markers, three germ layer
markers and tumorigenicity.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of low attachment dish
For the preparation of 2 DMEM medium, 13.4 g DMEM high glucose (Powder)
(GIBCO) and 3.7 g sodium bicarbonate were dissolved in 500 mL deionized water
and sterilized by 0.22 micron filter. 2 DMEMmediumwas pre-warmed to 37 C. 1%
agarose solution was made with agarose G-10 (BIOWEST) and deionized water and
heated until boiling in microwave. Equal volume of pre-warmed 2 DMEMmedium
and 1% agarose solution was mixed and coated on cell culture dish. When temper-
ature declined, agarose and DMEM mixture will form a layer of 0.5% gel with
a thickness of 4 mm.
2.2. Cell culture
HEK293 cell line was purchased from Peking Union cell center (ATCC source)
and RT4 cell line was presented by Professor Ying Jin, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
RT4 and HEK293 cells were cultured in McCOY’5A(HYCLONE) and DMEM(HY-
CLONE) medium respectively, both supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 1 mM L-
glutamin (Sigma), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), 0.1 mM NEAA (GIBCO) and 50
units of penicillin/streptomycin (HYCLONE). The cells were cultured at 37 C in 5%
CO2, and the medium was changed every 2 days. When cells have reached 90%
confluence, they were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin (Amresco) and passaged at
a ratio of 1:3. For 3D culture, 3  106 RT4 or HEK293 cells were transferred to
a 60 mm low attachment dish. These cells were cultured at 37 C with 5% CO2.
Medium was changed every other day.
2.3. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining
For AP staining, cells were fixed with 60% acetone (diluted with 1.5M sodium
citrate solution) for 1 min. The fixed cells were then washed with PBS for 1 min and
then stained with BCIP/NBT solution (Sigma). For BCIP/NBT solution, 330 ul NBT
solution and 33 ul BCIP solution were diluted with 10 mL AP working solution (0.1M
Tris-base, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, PH 9.5). The staining process was terminated
when purple stainings arised.
2.4. Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNAs of monolayer and sphere cells were extracted with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA concentration was
determined by optical density at 260 nm (OD260) using a spectrophotometer
(Amersham Biosciences). After removing residual DNA with Dnase I (Invitrogen),
equal amounts of RNA (1 mg) were added to reverse transcriptase reaction mix
(SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System, Invitrogen) with oligo-dT primers
(Invitrogen). Power SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems) was utilized to
perform Q-PCR using the Bio-RAD CFX96 Real-Time system (Bio-RAD). The
expression level was analyzed and normalized to GAPDH for each cDNA sample. Fold
change of gene expression was calculated using the 2-DDCT method. Primer se-
quences were available in Table S1.
2.5. Nude mice tumor formation assay
All experiments on animals were subjected to Chinese Ministry of Public Health
G. Su et al. / Biomater3216(CMPH) Guide. Cells with or without trypsinization, were suspended in DMEM
medium mixed with an equal volume of ECM (Sigma) to a final volume of 200 ml.Cells were injected subcutaneously by 27-gauge needles into the back flanks of 4e5
week old nude mice (8 BALB/c-nu). The mice were monitored twice a week for signs
of tumor growth for 2 months. Tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
sectioned to 5 mm thickness for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining.
2.6. Western blot
Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA (Sigma) buffer with Complete
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) for 30 min on ice to prepare the whole cell ly-
sates. Protein concentrations were measured using Protein Assay against BCA
standards (PIERCE). Equivalent quantity of protein lysates were electrophoresed in
12% SDS-ployacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride mem-
brane (Amershame). The membrane was blocked in TBS containing 10% nonfat milk
and 0.05% tween-20 for 2 h at the room temperature. Primary antibodies were
incubated for 2 h at the room temperature, and primary antibodies included:
NANOG (1:5000, Abcam), SOX2 (1:200, Invitrogen) and beta-Actin (1:500, Santa
Cruz). The HRP labeled secondary antibody was incubated for 2 h at the room
temperature. Secondary antibodies conjugatedwith HRP included: Goat-Anti Mouse
IgG (1:10,000, SouthernBiotech) and Goat-Anti Rabbit IgG (1:3000, Thermo
Scientific).
2.7. Side population analysis using flow cytometry
Monolayer and sphere RT4 cells were trypsinized with accutase (Sigma) and
then cells were suspended at 1106 cells/mL in DMEMmedium supplementedwith
2% FBS. These cells were then incubated at 37 C for 90min in darkness with 5 mg/mL
Hoechst 33342 (Sigma), either alone or in the presence of 50 mg/mL verapamil
(Sigma). At the end of incubation, cells were spun down in the cold and resuspended
in ice-cold PBSwith 2% FBS. After washing with PBS, the cells were treatedwith 2 mg/
mL propidium iodide to exclude dead cells. SP analysis was done using a FACS-
Vantage SE (BD Biosciences).
2.8. Cell migration assay
For measurements of cell migration, RT4 cells under monolayer and 3D culture
conditions were pre-treated with 24 h serum hungry. Then the monolayer and
sphere cells were trypsinized by 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in McCOY’5A
media containing no FBS as a density of 5  105 cells/mL. 200 ml cells in suspension
were plated on the top chamber of 24-well transwell containing 8 mm pores
(Corning). 600 ml medium with 10% FBS was added to the bottom chamber. Cells
were allowed to migrate in response to FBS. After 24 h, migrated cells on the bottom
were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The number of stained cells on the bottom
surface was counted under the microscope and four independent fields were
counted for each Transwell.
2.9. Transient transfections and luciferase reporter assays
For DNA transfections, HEK293 (8  104) cells were seeded per well of 24-well
plates 16 h prior to transfection. The monolayer cells were then transfected with
800 ng DNA plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the pro-
tocol supplied. Media was replaced at 6 h post-transfection.
Oct4-Luc vector was constructed by inserting 6W enhancer into PGL3 vector
with tk promoter. Nanog-Luc vector was kindly provided by Pro. Duanqing Pei. Sox2/
Oct4-Luc vector was kindly provided by Pro. Lisa Dailey. Reporter plasmids were
extracted using the PlasmidMini Kit I (OMEGA) with standard protocol. Transfection
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Being cultured for 24 h
after transfection, cells were trypsinized and subjected to 2D and 3D cultures
respectively. Luciferase assay was carried out according to the standard protocol
(Promega).
2.10. Bisulfate sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from monolayer and sphere cells using QIAamp
DNAMini Kit (Qiagen). Bisulfite treatment was performed using Epi-Tect Bisulfite kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The transcription
regulatory regions of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 were amplified by PCR (Hotstar
HiFidelity DNA polymerase, Qiagen). Primer sequences used for PCR amplification
were provided in Table S1. The PCR products were subcloned into pMD18-T vector
(TaKaRa) and individual clones were then sequenced. Clones were only accepted
with more than 90% cytosine conversion. BiQ Analyzer software (Max Planck Soci-
ety) was used for the quality check and methylation analysis. At least 20 replicates
were analyzed for each sequence.
2.11. Statistical analysis
The statistical significance (P values) in mean values of two-sample comparison
was determinedwith Students’ t-test. A value of P< 0.05was considered statistically
4 (2013) 3215e3222significant (*) and a value of P < 0.01 was considered extremely significant (**).
Values shown on graphs represent the means  s.d.
3. Results
3.1. Reprogramming transcription factor expression in 3D RT4
spheres
To create a low attachment surface, we coated cell culture dish
with a 4 mm layer of 0.5% agarose, prepared by mixing 1% agarose
and 2 DMEM medium (Fig. 1A). Covered with PBS, the low
attachment dish can be stored formonths at 4 C.When trypsinized
cells were cultured on low attachment dish, they formed 3D free-
floating spheres within 24 h. Arrow indicates cell spheres sus-
pended on low-attachment dish (Fig. 1B).
Utilizing this method, we performed 3D sphere culture on hu-
man urinary bladder papilloma cell line RT4 cells. Previous studies
demonstrated suspension culture of cancer cells with growth fac-
tors in serum-free or low-serummedium being a method to enrich
cancer stem cells. We here attempted to minimize the influence of
culture medium and just focused on the effect of 3D sphere culture.
Instead of using serum-free medium supplemented with growth
factors, we used complete growth medium with 10% fetal bovine
serum. As shown in Fig. 1C, cells under conventional monolayer
culture adhered to cell culture dish and demonstrated epithelial
morphology. In contrast, cells cultured on low attachment dish
were detached from the plate and formed floating 3D spheres. The
spheres maintained stable morphology even after several days.
OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 are core transcription factors for embry-
onic stem (ES) cells, which are important for maintaining the plu-
ripotent and self-renewal capacities of stem cells. OCT4, SOX2,
NANOG, LIN28 or OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4 have been used to
reprogram human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs). By Q-PCR, we found OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC
were upregulated in sphere culture compared tomonolayer culture
(Fig.1D).We also found the protein levels of NANOG and SOX2were
significantly upregulated in RT4 spheres by western blot (Fig. 1E).

3.2. Cancer stem cell characteristics of 3D RT4 spheres
Cancer stem cell characteristics of 3D RT4 spheres including
“side population” (SP) percentage, metastasis ability, and tumor-
igenicitywere analyzed. SP discrimination assay, amethod to detect
stem cell percentage using dye efflux properties of stem cells, is
often used in cancer stem cell evaluation [25]. The percentage of SP
cells in sphere culturewas 0.83 0.32%, compared to 0.370.12% in
monolayer culture (Fig. 2A). Metastasis of cancer cell is also corre-
lated with the stem cell characteristics. Low differentiation level of
cancer cells is correlated with greater risk of metastasis [26]. We
detected themetastasis ability of RT4 cell by transwell assay, and the

results indicated sphere culture promoted cell metastasis ability
(Fig. 2B, C). Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key
development program for cancer invasion and cancer stem cell
property [27]. Gene expression associated with EMT was examined
by Q-PCR. The results demonstrated FOXC2, SNAIL and ZEB2 were
upregulated in RT4 spheres compared to the monolayer (Fig. 2D).
We also performed in vivo nude mice tumor formation assay. As
shown in Fig. 2E and 1 106 monolayer RT4 cells formed tumors in
11 out of 14 mice, while 1  106 sphere derived RT4 cells formed
tumors in 14 out of 14 mice. Furthermore, 1  104 monolayer RT4
cells failed to form any tumors, while 1  104 sphere derived cells
formed tumors in 4 out of 14mice. The data indicated that 3D sphere
culture of RT4 tumor cells promoted cancer stem cell properties.
3.3. Reprogramming transcription factor expression in 3D HEK293
spheres
HEK293 is a non-cancerous cell line originally derived from hu-
manembryonickidneycells.HEK293cells adhered to thecell culture
dish and showed monolayer epithelial morphology, while cultured
on the low attachment plate HEK293 formed floating 3D spheres
(Fig. 3A). Q-PCR analyses of reprogramming factors showed that
OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, KLF4 and LIN28were all upregulated in sphere
culture at 5 and 10 days compared to monolayer culture (Fig. 3B).
Western blotting analyses also showed that the protein levels of
NANOG and SOX2 in sphere culture groupwere higher compared to
the monolayer group (Fig. 3C). Luciferase reporter constructs of the
binding sequences of OCT4, NANOG or SOX2/OCT4 were introduced
into HEK293 cells to detect the transcription activity of these tran-
scriptional factors. We found that OCT4, NANOG and SOX2/OCT4
proteins in 3D cells had higher transcription activities (Fig. 3D).
Similarly, bisulfite genomic sequencing analyses evaluating the
methylation status of cytosine guanine dinucleotides (CpG) in the
transcriptional regulatory regions of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2
revealed that the methylation status in HEK293 spheres was lower
than those in monolayer HEK293 cells (Fig. 3E), indicating these
genes were more transcriptionally activated than monolayer cells.

HEK293 sphere cells but negative in monolayer cells (Fig. 4A). By Q-
PCR analyses, mRNA expression of several undifferentiated ES cell
markers was also tested. The data showed that REX1, TDGF1, LEFTB,
EBAF, GRB7, PODXL and FGF4 were upregulated in HEK293 3D cells
(Fig. 4B). Moreover, endoderm markers (FOXA2, AFP, SOX17 and
PDX-1), mesoderm markers (BRANCHYURY and MSX1) and ecto-
derm markers (NESTIN, OTX2 and TP63) were all upregulated in
spheres (Fig. 4C). As kidney-derived HEK293 cells are derived from
mesoderm, the up-regulation of endoderm and ectoderm markers
also indicated cell reprogramming occurred. ESCs could form ter-
atomas when injected into nude mice, therefore the tumorigenicity
of HEK293 spheres was examined in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4D,
3  106 HEK293 monolayer cells failed to form any tumors, while
3  106 HEK293 spheres formed tumors in 3 out of 7 mice and
trypsinized sphere cells formed tumor in 1 out of 7 mice. Although
from HE staining of tumor sections formed by sphere cells, no
definite structures of endoderm, mesoderm or ectoderm were
detected, the tumorigenic properties suggesting the dediffer-
entiation occurred in HEK293 spheres.
3.5. Kidney progenitor characteristics of 3D HEK293 spheres
As HEK293 cells are derived from kidney tissues, we detected
kidney progenitor phenotype of HEK293 spheres. As illustrated in
Fig. 5A, metanephric mesenchyme, where kidney progenitor cells
reside, is the direct precursor tissue of adult kidney, which further
significantly after they were cultured for 5 and 10 days in 3D
spheres (Fig. 5CeF). The data suggested that the sphere culture
could promote kidney tissue specific dedifferentiation that pos-
sessing differentiation tendency into mature renal units.
4. Discussion
Herewe show through 3D sphere culture on the lowattachment
dishes, RT4 and HEK293 cells were reprogrammed and acquired
stemness properties, without involvement of any exogenous genes,
RNAs or proteins. The exact reprogramming mechanisms remain
elusive, but the close relationship between stem cell niche and cell
fate decisions has been documented. Stem cell microenvironment
influences stem cells in making decision to remain a quiescent
state, to undergo self-renewal or to exit the niche [28] andmediates
dedifferentiation and reprogramming of ectopic or more differ-
entiated cells to the corresponding stem cell phenotype [29e31].
We speculate 3D sphere cultures may provide a microenvironment
to promote cell dedifferentiation or reprogramming. First, sphere
culture may form inner hypoxia compared to monolayer culture
[32], as reported by many studies indicating hypoxic conditions
help maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells [33e36]. Secondly,
cell shape is a potent regulator of cell growth, physiology, embry-
onic development and stem cell differentiation [37e40], which
might be attributed to the re-organization of cytoskeleton [41].
Cells within 3D sphere cultures can form different cell shapes [42].

ZLED 2, FRIZZLED 7, ACVR2b andNTRK2were upregulated in HEK293
spheres (Fig. 5B). We also testified whether kidney progenitor cells
in HEK293 spheres possess the potential of differentiation into
nephrons. Terminally differentiated nephron markers of glomeruli,
proximal tubule, Henle’s loop and distal tubule were examined by
Q-PCR. Glomeruli markers (NPHS1, ACTN4, CD2AP, CDH3, PDPN and
PODXL), proximal tubule markers (AQP1, CLCN5, CUBN, LRP2 and
SLC5A1), Henle’s loop markers (UMOD and PKD2) and distal tubule
(SCNN1a and PKD1) of HEK293 spheres were all upregulated

exert exquisite control over stem cell fate decisions, mediated by
several classes of receptors, the most extensively studied being
integrins [43e46]. 3D sphere culture may form distinct extrac-
ellular matrix and establish new cellematrix interactions to influ-
ence cell fate. In addition, 3D sphere culture presented several
other differences from monolayer culture, including slower dif-
fusive transport of soluble factors, concentration gradients of sig-
naling factors, mechanical inputs and different spatial presentation
of regulatory cues from all directions [47].

ials 3G. Su et al. / BiomaterThrough 3D sphere culture, RT4 and HEK293 cells acquired
stemness to various degrees. It might be attributed to the different
cell characteristics and the diverse microenvironments formed in
RT4 and HEK293 spheres. Cancer stem cells have the exclusive
ability to self-renew and to differentiate into the heterogeneous
lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor. We found 3D
sphere culture of RT4 cells promoted cancer stem cell phenotypes.
It is similar with previous study that mutation of RB1 gene pro-
moted mouse fibroblasts to form spheres and to undergo reprog-
ramming to cancer stem cells [42]. As HEK293 cells are derived
from embryonic kidney tissues, HEK293 spheres presented phe-
notypes of ESCs and kidney progenitor cells. Osafune et al. reported
single renal progenitor cells derived from metanephric mesen-
chyme tend to form colonies, and these colonies maintain differ-
entiation capabilities into glomeruli and renal tubules [48]. So
kidney specific reprogramming in 3D HEK293 spheres might be
related with the features of kidney progenitors. There are still
questions waiting to be answered such as the cells were not fully
reprogrammed, and the decreased methylation in OCT4, NANOG
and SOX2 transcription regulatory regions may not be sufficient to
activate the expression of these genes to comparable levels of ESCs.
High-throughput screening of chemicals such as DNA methyl-
transferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors [49] to obtain fully
reprogrammed cells might be attempted in future. Further in-
vestigations of the effects of 3D sphere culture on fibroblasts
remain to be done to find a safer and more practical technique to
reprogram patient-derived somatic cells.

glomeruli (podocyte) (C), proximal tubule (D), Henle’s loop (E) and distal tubule(F) of HEK24 (2013) 3215e3222 32215. Conclusion
By utilizing non-adherent substrates, 3D spheres of RT4 and
HEK293 cells were obtained. The results demonstrated that these
cells were reprogrammed and acquired stemness to various de-
grees through this physical method, without using any exogenous
genes, RNAs or proteins. 3D sphere culture could provide better
understanding of the cell stemness regulation and shed light on
finding a safer and more practical technique to reprogram cells
with physical approaches.
