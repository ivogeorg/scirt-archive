Abstract
The inflammatory response in the injured spinal cord, an immune privileged site, has been mainly associated with the poor
prognosis. However, recent data demonstrated that, in fact, some leukocytes, namely monocytes, are pivotal for repair due
to their alternative anti-inflammatory phenotype. Given the pro-inflammatory milieu within the traumatized spinal cord,
known to skew monocytes towards a classical phenotype, a pertinent question is how parenchymal-invading monocytes
acquire resolving properties essential for healing, under such unfavorable conditions. In light of the spatial association
between resolving (interleukin (IL)-10 producing) monocytes and the glial scar matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
(CSPG), in this study we examined the mutual relationship between these two components. By inhibiting the de novo
production of CSPG following spinal cord injury, we demonstrated that this extracellular matrix, mainly known for its ability
to inhibit axonal growth, serves as a critical template skewing the entering monocytes towards the resolving phenotype. In
vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that this matrix alone is sufficient to induce such monocyte polarization. Reciprocal
conditional ablation of the monocyte-derived macrophages concentrated at the lesion margins, using diphtheria toxin,
revealed that these cells have scar matrix-resolving properties. Replenishment of monocytic cell populations to the ablated
mice demonstrated that this extracellular remodeling ability of the infiltrating monocytes requires their expression of the
matrix-degrading enzyme, matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), a property that was found here to be crucial for
functional recovery. Altogether, this study demonstrates that the glial scar-matrix, a known obstacle to regeneration, is a
critical component skewing the encountering monocytes towards a resolving phenotype. In an apparent feedback loop,
monocytes were found to regulate scar resolution. This cross-regulation between the glial scar and monocytes primes the
resolution of this interim phase of spinal cord repair, thereby providing a fundamental platform for the dynamic healing
response.

Introduction
Every year, spinal cord injury (SCI), a debilitating condition
with a limited prognosis for recovery, paralyzes around 130,000
people. The poor recovery of the central nervous system (CNS), a
delicate tissue that cannot tolerate toxic conditions, is generally
attributed to the hostile local milieu created at the trauma site.
Two major barriers to repair that have been identified include the
local inflammatory response, acknowledged for its neurotoxic
potential, and the creation of the glial scar, known to impair
regeneration [1,2,3]. The axonal growth inhibitory effects of the
scar matrix were supported by numerous in vitro studies
demonstrating that such molecules cause neurite retraction and
growth cone collapse [4], along with their well-defined develop-
mental role in formation of boundaries. Accordingly, research
efforts and clinical manipulations were directed at attempts to
eliminate and reorganize the chemical components of the glial scar
[5,6] and to suppress the ensuing immune response [7]. Recent
studies, however, indicated that the scar and some immune cell
populations each have independent, though transient, positive
roles. The glial scar was shown to provide an ‘SOS’ response, a
distress signal initiated by the tissue in response to the trauma that
demarcates the lesion site and restores the isolation of the CNS
from the circulation [8,9]. Likewise, leukocytes were demonstrated
to promote removal of tissue debris, secrete neurotrophic factors,
and support axonal regeneration [10,11,12,13,14,15].
Recently, a pivotal role for recovery was attributed to
monocytes that infiltrate the damaged CNS due to their non-
classical anti-inflammatory/resolving properties [11,14]. These
cells were shown to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine,
interleukin 10 (IL-10) and to terminate the local microglial
response. Based on their inflammation-resolving properties, these
monocyte-derived cells correspond to the previously identified
macrophage subset with immunoregulatory properties, the
resolving/regulatory macrophages (rMW), observed in wound
healing [16,17], or myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC),
which occur in cancer. Comparable suppressive monocytes were
identified also in other pathologies, including myocardial infarc-
tion [18,19]. Advances in the field of myeloid cells, revealing
macrophage heterogeneity and monocyte plasticity, brought this

often neglected population back into the spotlight. Until now, the
main factor determining the phenotype of the monocytes was
thought to be the surrounding cytokine milieu [16,17,20]. While a
pro-inflammatory milieu, enriched in either IFN-c or TNF-a,
skews monocytes towards a classical pro-inflammatory (M1)
phenotype, a Th2/anti-inflammatory environment, composed of
IL-4 and IL-13, or IL-10 and TGFb, generates alternatively-
activated (M2) or rMW, endowed with healing properties [11,14].
Given the pro-inflammatory environment at the site of trauma
[21], in the current study, we aimed to identify the factors that
maintain the healing properties of the infiltrating monocytes under
such pro-inflammatory conditions. In light of the immunomodu-
latory effects recently attributed to the glial scar matrix
component, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), in microg-
lial education [9], together with the spatial association between the
infiltrating monocytes and this glial scar component [9], we
investigated here the mutual regulation between these two key
processes in the course of the response to injury. We show that
CSPG is an essential platform, skewing the infiltrating monocytes
towards their resolving anti-inflammatory phenotype. In an
apparent reciprocal loop, the monocyte-derived cells acquire
matrix-degrading properties enabling their resolution of the glial
scar; this function was found to be critically dependent on their
expression of the matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), thereby
creating a more permissive environment for axonal regeneration.
This scar remodeling function of the infiltrating monocyte-derived
cells reveals a novel and crucial property of these essential cells,
which was found to be fundamental to recovery, by resolving not
only inflammation but scar deposition, as well.
Results
Resolving macrophages are embedded in a
pro-inflammatory milieu and are confined to the region
of glial scar deposition
Since the cytokine milieu is a major determinant of the
differentiation fate of monocytes [17,20,22], we tested the cytokine
profile that these cells encounter when reaching the injured spinal
cord parenchyma. To this end, we examined the cytokine profile
at the lesion site during the first week post injury. Pooled spinal
cord tissues, 4 mm in length that included the lesion site, margins
and surrounding undamaged parenchyma, were homogenized and
freeze-thawed to extract the proteins. The extracts were tested for
production of cytokines using a Multiplex system that simulta-
neously analyzes an array of cytokines in the same sample.
Multiplex analysis of M1/M2-skewing cytokines revealed that
following trauma to the CNS, the local environment at the lesion
site becomes biased towards a pro-inflammatory milieu, dominat-
ed by the most characteristic cytokine that determines the M1
skewing, TNF-a (Fig. 1A). The same tendency was observed at all
tested time points, and for all repetitions, but the fold change
varied. Immunostaining of spinal cord sections for IL-10, a
predominant M2- skewing cytokine, revealed its basal expression
by neurons of the healthy tissue, its downregulation following
injury, and its specific induction at later time points by
macrophages surrounding the lesion site (Figure S1). The
constitutive expression of IL-10 by neurons, and the loss of this
expression following injury, explains the small post injury
reduction seen by the Luminex analysis, which was reproduced
using an ELISA specific to IL-10.
Since these results suggest that the cytokine milieu was unlikely
to account for the differentiation of the infiltrating monocytes to
rMW, we hypothesized that other predominant factor(s) are likely
to play a fundamental role in this process. Matrix molecules
influence immune cell behavior during autoimmune disease [23],
and robust alterations in the extracellular matrix are observed in
the traumatized CNS [24]; thus, in light of the recently identified
immunomodulatory role of CSPG, the predominant extracellular
component of the glial scar matrix that endows microglia/
macrophages with neuroprotective properties characterized by
their production of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) [9], we
assessed the contribution of this matrix to monocyte skewing
towards their essential resolving properties.
Although the monocyte-derived macrophages and activated
resident microglia are functionally distinct, there is currently no
differential morphological marker that can distinguish between
them. Thus, in the present study, we used a well-established bone
marrow (BM) chimera model [25], in which the BM of irradiated
(using head shielding) host mice, is replaced in adulthood by
genetically labeled BM expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)
under the control of the myeloid promoter, Cx3cr1 [26], enabling
the clear distinction of infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages
(GFP+) from resident microglia (non-fluorescent), as reported
previously [14,27]. The mice were analyzed for their chimerism 8
weeks following transplantation, and were subjected to spinal cord
injury. Immunohistochemical analysis of the injured spinal cord
parenchyma 7 days post injury revealed that the skewed
monocyte-derived cells (Cx3cr1
GFP) that acquired a rMW pheno-
type (demonstrated by the high expression of the anti-inflamma-
tory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, the hallmark of this subset [17],
as previously shown [14], and as verified here Fig. 1B), were
found to concentrate at areas enriched with the glial scar-matrix
molecule, CSPG (Fig. 1C). As was previously demonstrated [14],
no resolving IL-10 producing monocyte-derived macrophages
accumulated in the epicenter of the lesion, despite the abundant
accumulation of other macrophages there; notably, this area is
devoid of scar tissue.
The glial scar matrix molecule, chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan, determines the resolving phenotype of the
monocytes that encounter it
The spatial association between the glial scar matrix CSPG and
the infiltrating monocyte-derived cells, in light of the immuno-
modulating properties attributed to this scaffold [9], prompted us
to test whether this matrix is involved in the immune-skewing of
the infiltrating monocyte-derived cells towards their resolving,
anti-inflammatory phenotype. Using de-novo inhibition of CSPG
biosynthesis via the administration of the pharmacological
inhibitor xyloside, previously used in both in vitro and in vivo
studies [28], we have previously shown that CSPG is fundamental
for the repair following spinal cord injury, when restricted to the
acute phase post-injury [9]. In the same study, we suggested that
this matrix modulates the macrophages/microglia that encounter
it to attain non-cytotoxic neuroprotective properties, characterized
by reduced TNF-a and increased IGF-1. In our previous study we
noted that such treatment disrupted the spatial organization of the
monocyte-derived cells relative to the injury site; however, the
impact on the phenotype of these cells was not addressed. As we
found that the resolving monocyte-derived macrophages were
concentrated at the lesion margins in association with CSPG
deposition, we next tested whether the same in vivo strategy for
inhibition of CSPG biosynthesis would affect not only the location
of these cells but also their phenotype.
To that end, [Cx3cr1
GFP/+.wt] BM chimeric mice, created
following irradiation and reconstitution with labeled BM, were
subjected to spinal cord injury 8 weeks post transplantation, and
were treated twice a day for 5 consecutive days with either PBS or
xyloside, starting immediately following the contusion (Fig. 2A).

In line with our previous report [9], such treatment with xyloside,
which led to a 50% reduction in CSPG deposition at the lesion
margins when analyzed immediately after the last xyloside
injection (Fig. 2B), resulted in monocyte infiltration into the
epicenter of the lesion at day 7 post injury, an area from which
they were excluded in the presence of CSPG (Fig. 2C). Notably,
the changes in the spatial compartmentalization of the infiltrating
GFP monocytes were not accompanied by any alteration in their
cell numbers (Student’s t-test; p = 0.365). Yet, this early inhibition of
CSPG production had a negative impact on their acquisition of an

anti-inflammatory phenotype, manifested by reduced IL-10
expression at day 7 post injury, as quantified using the ImagePro
software on 2 mm2 antibody-labeled spinal cord sections that
included the lesion site, margins and surrounding parenchyma
(Fig. 2D, E). We next tested whether this reduction in IL-10
expression was associated with a suppression of the activated
microglial response, as previously described by us [14]. We found
that the reduction of the suppressive potency of the monocyte-
derived cells was accompanied by enhanced activation of the
resident microglia, as indicated by IB-4 immunoreactivity at day
14 post injury, and its evaluation by ImagePro, as above (Fig. 2F).
The fact that partial inhibition of CSPG had a dramatic effect on
the resolving phenotype of the infiltrating monocyte-derived cells
suggests that this matrix has a fundamental biological significance
in determining the fate of these cells. As the extracellular matrix
around the site is a complex branched structure, it is likely that
such partial inhibition has dramatic effect on the local organiza-
tion of the perineuronal network created around the lesion site
following injury. It is probable that the complex structure limits the
spread of the toxic material concentrated at the epicenter, and
prevents the infiltrating cells from coming into contact with this
milieu enriched with M1- skewing cytokines. In this manner, even
partial inhibition would breach this matrix capacity to serve as a
structure insulating the two compartments from each other.
Notably, the observed alterations following xyloside treatment
were not due to non-specific effects of the drug, as slightly delayed
administration of xyloside, starting at day 2 post injury (for 5
consecutive days), as was previously shown [9], did not lead to
increased microglial activation, nor did it affect the spatial
organization of the infiltrating monocytes. In addition, such
delayed administration did not affect IL-10 production by these
monocytes (Figure S2). As the levels of IL-10 immunoreactivity at
the site measured on day 7 post injury were not affected by the
delayed application of xyloside, the reduced activation of the
resident microglia, as indicated by IB-4 immunoreactivity at day
14 post injury, could not be attributed to the anti-inflammatory
nature of the infiltrating monocytes. We thus suspect that the
delayed inhibition has other effect(s) that result in such IB-4
regulation.
As the injured spinal cord is known to contain a large amount of
myelin debris, factors that were previously shown to have
modulatory M1/M2 effects following their engulfment by
macrophages [29,30], we next tested whether such myelin uptake
might be responsible for monocyte skewing towards their IL-10-
expressing phenotype. Phagocytosis by macrophages of degrada-
tion products of myelin was tested using Oil Red O (ORO)
staining, as previously described [10,31]. ORO staining of spinal
cord sections taken at day 7 post injury revealed equal distribution
of macrophages that engulfed myelin in the lesion epicenter and at
its margins (Figure S3). This uniform distribution of macrophage
uptake of myelin was not in spatial correlation with the resolving,
IL-10 producing phenotype of the macrophages, and thus was not
likely to participate in their skewing. To verify that the observed
effect seen following immediate xyloside treatment could not be
attributed to changes in myelin engulfment, we ORO stained
spinal cord sections isolated from either PBS or xyloside- treated
mice (day 7 post injury). Although significant reduction was
observed in IL-10 immunoreactivity following xyloside treatment,
no noteworthy differences were observed between the two groups
in the myelin engulfment by macrophages. This suggests that while
an M1/M2 modulating effect has been attributed to myelin
engulfment [29,30], the acquisition of the resolving phenotype by
the monocyte-derived cells at the injured spinal cord, character-
ized by the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10,
does not seem to be related to uptake of myelin.
To reveal the direct effect of CSPG on monocyte skewing, we
employed an in vitro assay using primary cultures of naı̈ve CD115+
monocytes seeded on CSPG or on an inert substrate, Poly-D-
lysine (PDL), as a basal reference. Flow cytometric analysis of the
cultured cells showed that these substrates induced the develop-
ment of two populations that differed in their morphology (based
on size and granularity) as well as in their IL-10 expression levels
(Fig. 2G). However, the CSPG cultures became enriched with the
population comprised of cells expressing higher levels of IL-10
(R2; Fig. 2G, H). Similarly, increased overall IL-10 expression
was observed in CSPG-cultured monocytes (Fig. 2I, J). Enhanced
expression of this anti-inflammatory cytokine was also observed in
the presence of IFN-c, a potent M1-skewing factor (Fig. 2K),
suggesting that the glial scar matrix plays a dominant role
determining the phenotype of the monocytes that encounter it,
even in a pro-inflammatory setting. Thus, our data demonstrate
that the glial scar matrix molecule, CSPG, is a critical
immunoregulatory scaffold, inducing the monocytes towards the
rMW subset, characterized by their production of the anti-
inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.
Infiltrating monocytes promote glial scar matrix
resolution via the production of matrix
metalloproteinase 13
The well recognized matrix degrading properties and tissue
remodeling of MW as part of peripheral wound healing [32], and
especially of the resolving monocyte-derived cells [18,19],
prompted us to examine whether the infiltrating monocytes are
not only affected by CSPG, but might in turn regulate the
resolution of this scar matrix molecule, which is known to be a
major obstacle for CNS regeneration in the chronic phase
[3,5,33].
To this end, we adopted an in vivo cell ablation strategy that
targets the monocyte-derived cells in close proximity to the glial
scar matrix. Approximately 50% of the monocytes infiltrating the
lesioned spinal cord were found to be CD11c+ at day 7 post injury
(Fig. 3A), and those CD11c+Cx3cr1GFP monocyte-derived cells
resided at the margins of the site in close association with CSPG
enriched areas (Fig. 3B). We therefore used a previously
employed [14] conditional in vivo cell ablation strategy targeting
the monocyte-derived cells in virtue of their CD11c promoter
activity [34]. Specifically, we generated [CD11c-DTR: Cx3cr1
GFP/+
. wt] BM chimeras, using head protection during irradiation, as
previously described [14]; GFP expression in the transferred cells
allowed us to trace the infiltrating monocytes, and the Diphtheria
Toxin Receptor (DTR) transgene enabled us to specifically deplete
this cell population upon their upregulation of CD11c (Fig. 3C).
The chimeras were tested for their chimerism 8 weeks following
the BM transplantation, and then were immediately subjected to
spinal cord contusion, and treated with Diphtheria Toxin (DTx).
As previously reported, such treatment resulted in the specific
depletion of GFP+ cells, corresponding to the infiltrating
monocytes, without affecting their CNS counterparts, the resident
microglia (GFP2) (Fig. 3D). DTx-dependent depletion of
monocyte-derived cells in close proximity to scar deposition
resulted in a higher level of CSPG immunoreactivity, as evaluated
on day 14 post injury, the peak of CSPG accumulation, using
computerized ImagePro analysis of images of 2 mm2 spinal cord
sections (Fig. 3E,F). We restored the monocyte pool of DTx-
treated chimeras by intravenous injection of wt CD115+
monocytes (carrying the allotypic marker, CD45.1; injected on
d0 and d3 post injury) that did not harbor the CD11c-DTR

transgene, and whose descendants were therefore resistant to the
toxin treatment. The monocytes infiltrated the injured spinal cord
(Fig. 3G; as previously reported [14]), and were found to be
sufficient to restore the lost regulation of the glial scar matrix
deposition observed in the depleted mice (Fig. 3H,I). According-
ly, while DTx-treated chimeras showed massive accumulation of
CSPG around the lesion epicenter at day 14 post injury,
reconstitution of DTx-treated mice with monocytes resistant to
the depletion resulted in decreased accumulation of this scar
matrix component. These results demonstrate a novel aspect of the
resolving properties of the recruited monocytes associated with the
resolution/termination of the glial scar deposition.
Matrix degradation enzymes have been suggested to mediate
the tissue-remodeling properties of macrophages [32]. We next
asked whether this crucial matrix-resolving function of the
entering monocytes is mediated via the regulation of the matrix-
degrading enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). While the
majority of the matrix degrading enzymes tested showed increased

levels following injury (Figure S4), only the matrix metallopro-
teinase (MMP)-13 was negatively affected as an outcome of the
depletion of the monocyte-derived cells by DTx, as evaluated at
day 5 post injury by RT-PCR of tissue spinal cord samples
(Fig. 4A). Immunostaining of spinal cord sections confirmed that
CD11c+ monocyte-derived MW that localized to the lesion
margins are a major source of MMP-13 (Fig. 4B–D). MMP-13
showed highly restricted expression around the lesion site. This
location at the margins of the injury site appears to be ideal for
mediating glial scar-matrix degradation.
We next tested if MMP-13 expression by the infiltrating
monocytes is essential for their scar remodeling capacity. To this
end, we took advantage of MMP-13 knockout (KO) mice [35]. We
first used [MMP-132/2.wt] BM chimeras, in which the host BM
is replaced with BM isolated from the knockout mice. In the
resulting chimeras, the hematopoietic lineage is MMP-13
deficient, while the CNS tissue is of host (wild-type) origin. These
mice were subjected to spinal cord injury 8 weeks post BM
transplantation. Comparative analysis for CSPG immunoreactiv-
ity in spinal cord sections 14 days post trauma revealed higher

CSPG accumulation in the MMP-13 KO chimeras (Fig. 4E,F).
To further attribute this functionality to MMP13 expression by
monocytes, we used the depletion-restoration strategy. DTx-
depleted [CD11c-DTR.wt] BM chimeras, were replenished with
CD115+ monocytes (via intravenous administration on d0 and d3
post injury), isolated from either wild-type mice, or from MMP-13
KO mice. Non-DTx treated chimeric mice served as a control.
The mice were tested for CSPG immunoreactivity 14 days post
injury. As reported above (Fig. 3H,I), monocyte depletion via
DTx treatment resulted in increased CSPG accumulation,
whereas reconstitution with wt monocytes led to a reduction in
CSPG levels relative to the non-reconstituted mice (Fig. 4G,H).

Importantly, while reconstitution with wt monocytes restored the
regulation of CSPG accumulation, replenishment with MMP-13
KO monocytes failed to do so (Fig. 4G,H). Altogether, these
results highlight the importance of monocytes as critical regulators
of scar deposition, in particular its extracellular matrix CSPG, via
the expression of the matrix degradation enzyme, MMP-13.
Production of MMP-13 by monocytes is essential for the
functional recovery from spinal cord injury
In light of the tissue remodeling function attributed here to the
infiltrating monocytes, together with the well-established phenom-
enon that CSPG degradation augments functional recovery
following spinal cord injury [3,5,9], we next aimed to test if the
remodeling property of these cells has functional implications to
the repair process. We therefore repeated the experiments in the
MMP-13 deficient mice, as described above, while evaluating the
functional motor recovery of the hind limbs following spinal cord
contusion according to the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS). In this non-
linear scale, 0 represents complete paralysis of the hind limb, while
a score of 9 represents normal mobility [36]. Mice in which the
hematopoietic lineage lacked MMP-13, [MMP-132/.wt], had
worse motor function recovery of the hind limbs, relative to their
control [wt.wt] chimeras (Fig. 5A,B). Evaluation of lesion size
according to myelin staining, using Luxol-Nissl, further confirmed
these results (Fig. 5C,D). To attribute this essential function to the
monocyte subset, we again employed the depletion-restoration
strategy; [CD11c-DTR.wt] BM chimeric mice were subjected to
spinal cord injury 8 weeks post transplantation. Four groups were
used: one group was left untreated, one group was treated with
DTx, and the other two groups received DTx and passive transfer
of DTx-resistant monocytes isolated either from wt or from MMP-
13 KO mice, as described above. The mice were followed for
motor function performance of the hind limbs, and scored
according to the BMS. DTx depletion of monocyte-derived cells
resulted in worse motor function performance following spinal
cord injury, while reconstitution of the depleted mice with
monocytes resistant to the toxin, restored the lost motor function
(Fig. 5E,F). In contrast, replenishment of the monocyte pool with
MMP-13-deficient monocytes failed to restore recovery, and
resulted in similar motor function as that observed in the DTx-
treated mice that did not receive monocytes (Fig. 5E,F).
Evaluation of lesion size confirmed these results (Fig. 5G,H).
These results attribute a critical functional relevance to the
infiltrating monocytes via the expression of the matrix remodeling
enzyme MMP-13.
Importantly, these two characteristics of the infiltrating
monocytes following spinal cord injury, the anti-inflammatory
nature described by us before [14] and the scar degradation
property identified here, are not contradictory. These two
properties should be viewed as two complementary aspects of
their resolving phenotype. These cells are endowed with a panel
of properties to resolve the first phase of the dynamic response
post injury, which is characterized by both intense inflammation
and scar formation. In fact, the connection between the capacity
of monocytes to remodel cellular matrix and promote regener-
ation and between their anti-inflammatory essential properties
was suggested previously in peripheral tissue healing [18,19].
Interestingly, in vitro cultures of naı̈ve monocytes revealed
enhanced expression of the Mmp13 transcript when the cells
were grown on a CSPG substrate (relative mRNA expression; 0.5
on PDL vs. 2.5 on CSPG), raising the possibly of an endogenous
feedback loop, in which the glial scar matrix induces its own
degradation.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that two main phenomena that
occur in the injured CNS, the inflammatory response and
accumulation of glial scar, which were generally assumed to be
independent and separately detrimental, are in fact tightly
connected in an intimate relationship that promotes their mutual
potential to benefit healing (Fig. 6; scheme). The glial scar matrix
was found here to serve as a necessary scaffold, skewing monocytes
towards the resolving phenotype, characterized by the production
of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, thereby promoting
resolution (termination) of the local inflammation. In a reciprocal
relationship, the monocyte-derived cells were found to produce the
matrix degrading enzyme MMP13 and thereby regulate CSPG
accumulation and promote repair.
The immunosuppressive nature of CSPG in the response to
trauma, as observed here, is consistent with data demonstrating
that scar-associated astrocytes are required to maintain a balanced
inflammatory response [37,38]. The immunoregulatory nature of
this matrix molecule is substantiated by our previous observation
that it promotes neurotrophic factor production by the resident
microglia [9]. In addition, the immunoregulatory features of the
scar appear to be a general feature of tissue healing, as
proteoglycans are key immune-modulators following trauma to
internal organs [8]. Such a function performed by the matrix is
essential under the unfavorable milieu that exists at the site of
trauma, which is laden with factors known to mediate M1 skewing.
As the extracellular matrix around the site is a complex structure,
built like a branched tree, it seems that every component within it
has a dramatic effect on the local organization of the perineuronal
network created around the lesion site following injury. We can
suggest that this complex structure can, on the one hand, have a
direct effect on the encountering cells, and on the other hand
serves as a physical barrier isolating these cells from the material
concentrated at the epicenter, which possesses M1-skewing
properties.
Scar deposition is an essential response to the trauma, that
should be tightly controlled [9]; although it is essential for the
repair at the acute phase [9], the scar becomes an obstacle in the
subsequent steps [3,5,9]. Such timely regulation of scar deposition
is shown here to be achieved by the bi-directional interaction
between the glial scar and the monocytes; MW, which use the scar
for their own education, were identified here as the cellular
component that promotes scar degradation via the production of
matrix degradation enzymes. In support of our in vivo observation,
in vitro skewing of macrophages towards an M2 phenotype was
recently shown to promote axonal regeneration [11]. In addition,
scar resolving properties were recently ascribed to MW in the
resolution of a different kind of collagen-based scar, during hepatic
fibrosis, in which the same MMP described here, MMP-13, plays a
fundamental role, as well [32]. MMP-13 was not previously
proposed to have a role in spinal cord repair. Only recently was it
suggested, based on in vitro studies, to degrade CSPG. In addition
to CSPG, MMP-13 may regulate other components of the
perineuronal net, such as Tenascin and Aggrecan, which are
known to be substrates for this enzyme and critical components of
the glial scar, further highlighting its functional relevance to the
dynamic repair response post trauma. Interestingly, tissue matrix
modulation and regeneration properties were recently attributed
to monocyte-derived macrophages, and more specifically to the
anti-inflammatory subset [18,19]. Thus resolution/termination of
inflammation and tissue remodeling are tightly interconnected,
and seem to be a general property of wound healing macrophages.
In fact, one can view the two essential characteristics of the

infiltrating monocytes for the recovery from spinal cord injury, the
anti-inflammatory properties described by us before [14] and scar
degradation properties of these cells revealed here, as two aspects
of their resolving phenotype. These cells ‘resolve’ the first phase of
the dynamic response to the injury, which is characterized by both
intense inflammation and scar formation.
The identified monocyte-glial scar interplay thus primes the
resolution phase of CNS tissue healing, thereby providing a
platform for the repair response. Revealing the underlying
mechanism behind this essential dialogue might enable the
development of novel therapeutic approaches to fine-tune it.
The recognition of a novel enzyme that modulates CSPG
deposition and has a fundamental contribution to the repair
process indicates a potential target for future therapies. Our
findings harbor significant clinical implications not only for the
repair of CNS injuries, but also for the resolution of autoimmune
diseases of the CNS, in which inflammation goes awry. In
addition, as regulatory MW/MDSCs provide a predominant
tolerance mechanism by which tumors escape the immune system,
a deeper understanding of how monocytes are skewed by matrix
components might suggest additional therapeutic avenues.

generous gift from Prof. Steffen Jung. (5) CD11c-DTR:
Cx3cr1

locus and the CD11c-DTR transgene); and (6) MMP-13 knockout
mice [35], a generous gift from Prof. Carlos López-Otı́n. For all
experiments, adult males aged 8–10 weeks were used. Animals
were supplied by the Animal Breeding Center of The Weizmann
Institute of Science. All animals were handled according to the
regulations formulated by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC).
Bone Marrow Radiation Chimeras
[Cx3cr1
GFP/+.wt], [CD11c-DTR.wt], [MMP-132/2.wt],
[wt.wt] and [CD11c-DTR:Cx3cr1
GFP/+.wt] BM chimeras were
prepared by subjecting gender-matched recipient mice (8–10 week
old) to lethal whole-body irradiation (950 rad) while shielding the
brain, as previously described [9,14]. The mice were then
reconstituted with 3–56106 BM cells harvested from the hind
limbs (tibia and femur) and forelimbs (humerus) of the appropriate
donor mice. BM cells were obtained by flushing the bones with
Dulbecco’s PBS under aseptic conditions, and were then collected
and washed by centrifugation (10 min, 1,000 rpm, 4uC). The
chimeric mice were subjected to spinal cord contusion 8–10 weeks
after BM transplantation.
Spinal Cord Injury
The spinal cords of deeply anesthetized mice were exposed by
laminectomy at T12, and contusive (200 kdynes) centralized injury
was performed using the Infinite Horizon spinal cord impactor
(Precision Systems), as previously described [9,14]. The animals
were maintained on twice-daily bladder expression. Animals that
were contused in a nonsymmetrical manner were excluded from
the experimental analysis.
Xyloside Treatment
Xyloside (4-methylumbelliferyl-b-D-xylopyranoside; Sigma-Al-
drich) was injected as previously described (0.8 mg/mouse) [9].
Briefly, the mice were intraperitoneally (IP) injected twice daily for
5 consecutive days, starting either immediately after the injury or 2
days later. For histological analysis, mice were killed 7 days or 14
days after the injury.
Diphtheria Toxin Administration
Diphtheria toxin (DTx; 8 ng/g body weight; Sigma) was
injected intraperitoneally (IP), repeatedly at 1 day intervals,
starting immediately after the injury.
Adoptive Transfer of Monocytes
CD115+ monocytes were isolated as previously reported [39].
Briefly, BM cells were harvested from the femora and tibiae of
naı̈ve mice, and enriched for mononuclear cells on a Ficoll density
gradient. The CD115+ BM monocyte population was isolated
through MACS enrichment using biotinylated anti-CD115
antibodies and streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Miltenyi
Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Following this
procedure, monocytes (purity 90%) were intravenously (IV)
injected (3.56106 cells per mouse) twice during the first week of
recovery, on d0 and d3 post injury.
Immunohistochemistry
Due to technical limitations of some of the antibodies that were
used, two different tissue preparations (paraffin embedded and
microtomed frozen sections) were used, as previously described
[9]. Whenever possible, the results were confirmed using both
techniques. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP
(1:100; MBL), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP;
1:100; Dako Cytomation), goat anti-IL-10 (1:20; R&D Systems),
mouse anti-CS-56 (1:100; Sigma), mouse anti-Hu (1:50; Rheni-
um), mouse anti-MMP13 (1:50; Abcam), and hamster anti-CD11c
(1:50; Chemicon). For microglial/MW labeling, TRITC- or FITC-
conjugated Bandeiraea simplicifolia isolectin B4 (IB-4; 1:50; Sigma-
Aldrich) was added for 1 h to the secondary antibody solution.
Secondary antibodies used included: Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-
rabbit antibody, Cy2/Cy5 conjugated donkey anti-mouse anti-
body, Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, Cy3-conjugated don-
key anti-goat, and biotin goat anti-hamster (1:200; all from Jackson
Immuno Research). Cy3-streptavidin was used for CD11c
staining. The slides were exposed to Hoechst stain (1:4,000;
Invitrogen Probes) for 1 min. GFAP staining was used for
demarcation of the lesion site.
Myelin integrity was qualitatively and quantitatively examined
on paraffin-embedded sections that were stained with Luxol fast
blue for myelin, and with Nissl to identify the nuclei and the thin
cytoplasmic layer around them. Myelin phagocytosis was analyzed
in sections stained with Oil Red O (Fisher Scientific) and
counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin to identify cell nuclei,
as previously described [10,31]. For microscopic analysis, a Nikon
fluorescent microscope (Nikon E800) or Zeiss LSM 510 confocal
laser scanning microscope were used. Longitudinal sections of the
spinal cord were analyzed. Numbers of cells, immunoreactivity
(density) and lesion size were all determined automatically with
Image-Pro Plus 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics). To measure lesion

between the resolving monocytes and the glial scar matrix. The
glial scar matrix serves as a regulatory template, dictating the anti-
inflammatory nature of the infiltrating monocytes that encounter it. In
turn, the monocytes that used the scar for their own education regulate
the scar degradation and resolution via the secretion of matrix
degradation enzyme, MMP-13.

size, demarcation of the damaged site was determined according
to Luxol-Nissl staining as well as H&E staining. In order to avoid
overestimation due to counting of partial cells that appeared
within the section, we took special care to count only cells with
intact morphology and a nucleus that was larger than 4 mm in
diameter, both in the manual and software-automated counting.
The ImagePro quantification was performed using 2 mm2 spinal
cord tissues pictures, centralized on the lesion site, which included
lesion site, the margins and surrounding undamaged parenchyma.
Three sections from different depths were assessed for each
animal, and 4–8 mice were tested in each group. For
immunoreactivity measurements, the values are presented in
arbitrary units and indicate total reactivity in the tissue. The
number of cells per mm3 was calculated by considering the
thickness of the sections.
Isolation of Spinal Cord Cells and Flow Cytometric
Analysis
Mice subjected to spinal cord injury were killed by an overdose
of anaesthetic and their spinal cords were prepared for flow
cytometric analysis by perfusion with PBS via the left ventricle.
Spinal cord sections were cut from individual mice, including the
injured site and adjacent margins (4 mm long in each of the
sections), and tissues were homogenized using a software
controlled sealed homogenization system (Dispomix; http://
www.biocellisolation.com). For IL-10 staining, 26106/ml cells
were cultured on 96-well plates. The following fluorochrome-
labeled monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmin-
gen, BioLegend, or eBioscience and used according to the
manufacturers’ protocols: PE conjugated anti-CD11b, IL-10 and
CD115 antibodies, and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD45.1,
and CD11b antibodies. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur
cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD
Biosciences) or on a LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences) using
Flow Jo software (Tree Star). Isotype controls were routinely used
in all the experiments. In addition, in each experiment, relevant
negative control groups were used to identify the populations of
interest and to exclude others.
Multiplex cytokine analysis system
Wild-type C57BL/6J injured and non-injured mice were killed
at different time points after spinal cord injury. Samples from
lesion sites (4 mm length of spinal cord tissue, including lesion site,
margins and surrounding non-injured parenchyma) were pooled
in groups of three. The excised tissues were homogenized in PBS
containing protease inhibitors (1:100; P8340, Sigma). Four freeze-
thaw cycles were performed to break the cell membranes
(3 minutes each). Homogenates were then centrifuged for
10 min at 500 g, and the total protein quantities in supernatants
were determined by Bradford reagent. Frozen supernatants were
assayed in duplicate using Multiplex Bead-based Luminex Assays
(MILLIPLEX mouse cytokine/chemokine panel or TGFb1,2,3
MILLIPLEX kit; Millipore), performed by outsourcing (American
Medical Laboratories), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Results are expressed as picograms of protein per milligram
of total tissue protein.
Assessment of functional recovery from spinal cord injury
Recovery was evaluated by hind-limb locomotor performance,
assessed according to the open-field Basso Mouse Scale (BMS)
[36], with nonlinear scores ranging from 0 (complete paralysis) to 9
(normal mobility); each score represents a distinct motor functional
state. Mice were randomly separated into groups, while verifying
that the average starting score was similar in all groups. Blind
scoring ensured that observers were not aware of the treatment
received by each mouse. Locomotor activity in an open field was
monitored twice a week by placing the mouse for 4 min at the
center of a circular enclosure (diameter 90 cm, wall height 7 cm)
made of molded plastic with a smooth, non-slippery floor. Before
each evaluation, the mice were carefully examined for peritoneal
infection, wounds in the hind limbs, and tail and foot autophagia.
Animals that showed a difference of more than 2 score points
between their two hind limbs were excluded from the experimen-
tal analysis. The results showing functional outcomes presented in
this study were, in each case, from a single experiment
representative of several independent replicates, as indicated in
the figure legends. As spontaneous recovery from spinal cord
injury is limited, we used the previously described [9,14] protocol
of 45D vaccination (100 mg; emulsified in an equal volume of
complete Freund’s adjuvant containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(2.5 mg/ml; Difco); 1 week prior the injury), which creates a more
sensitive system to evaluate functional recovery.
Culture of monocytes
25 cm2 Falcon tissue culture flasks (BD Biosciences) were coated
either with poly-D-lysine (PDL) (20 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in
borate buffer, pH 8 for 4 h; or CSPG (10 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich)
in PBS. CD115+ cells were isolated as described above. A total of
66106 CD115+ cells were seeded per flask on CSPG or on the
control substrate, PDL, in the following media: RPMI-1640
(Biological Industries, Beit Ha-Emek, Israel), 10% FCS, 2 mM L-
Gln, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, NAA,
and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. The purified cells were cultured in
5% CO2 at 37uC. The cultures were harvested 2 or 5 days later,
and the supernatants collected. IFN-c was added to some of the
cultures (100 ng/ml), as indicated.
Quantitative Real time PCR
Target cells or tissue were homogenized in Tri reagent (Sigma),
and total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Mini-kit.
Random hexamers (AB) were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis.
Both procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The relative amounts of mRNA were calculated by
using the standard curve method, and were normalized to the
housekeeping gene, peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PpiA). Each RNA
sample was run in triplicate, and each group was comprised of
three to five animals. The primers for all genes tested (see Table 1)
were designed using PrimerQuest software, from Integrated DNA
Technologies (http://eu.idtdna.com).
ELISA assay for cytokine levels
Cytokine ELISA for IL-10 was performed on culture superna-
tants of the in vitro experiment, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (eBioscience, Mouse Interleukin-10 Ready-SET-Go!).
Each supernatant sample was run in triplicate, and a total of five
supernatants were used per group. Results were expressed as
picograms of protein per milliliter of supernatant.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using the Student’s t-test to compare
between two groups. One-way ANOVA was used to compare
several groups; the Tukey’s HSD procedure (p= 0.05) was used for
follow-up pairwise comparison of groups. Repeated measures
ANOVA was used in the functional BMS scoring with follow-up
comparison of treatments for each day by contrast t-test and
correction for multiple comparison by the Holm method (p= 0.05).
