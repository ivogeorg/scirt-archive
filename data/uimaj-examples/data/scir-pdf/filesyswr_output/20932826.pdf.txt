.e lnearly complete failure of the severed axons to regenerate. Pathology of
the spinal injury is determined not only by the initial mechanical insult,
but also by secondary processes including ischemia and cell death, and
eventually results in cyst formation and enlargement of the trauma
zone. Cytokines, free radicals and nitric oxide generated by microglia
stimulate reactive astrocytes to secrete proteoglycans and to form glial
scar (Busch et al., 2010; Fitch and Silver, 2008). In addition, retrograde
degeneration occurs in the lesioned spinal tracts (Deumens et al., 2005).
Severed axons are limited by inhibitory nature of myelin and the glial
scar, and only capable of sprouting with little functional recovery
tissue and glial cells, bridging nerve grafts and neurotrophic factors
could, in principle, stimulate regeneration of injured central nerve
tracts (Bunge, 2008; Fortun et al., 2009; Kocsis et al., 2009; Lu and
Tuszynski, 2008; Tetzlaff et al., 2010).
Remarkably promising effects on axonal regeneration and neuro-
nal survival after spinal cord injury have been reported after
transplantation of a certain glial cell type, the olfactory ensheathing
cells (OEC) (Fouad et al., 2009a; Franssen et al., 2007; Kocsis et al.,
2009; Lindsay et al., 2010; Munoz-Quiles et al., 2009; Radtke and

(3 weeks) or long-term (7 weeks) cultured OEC were transplanted into the lateral funiculus at 1 mm rostral
and caudal to the transection site. At 3–8 weeks after transplantation, labeled OEC were mainly found in the
injection sites and in the trauma zone. Short-term cultured a-OEC supported regrowth of rubrospinal,
raphaespinal and CGRP-positive fibers, and attenuated retrograde degeneration in the red nucleus. Short-
term cultured b-OEC failed to promote axonal regrowth but increased the density of rubrospinal axons within
the dorsolateral funiculus and provided significant neuroprotection for axotomized rubrospinal neurons. In
addition, short-term cultured OEC attenuated sprouting of rubrospinal terminals. In contrast, long-term
cultured OEC neither enhanced axonal growth nor prevented retrograde cell death. The results suggest that
the age of OEC in culture and the method of cell purification could affect the efficacy of OEC to support
neuronal survival and regeneration after spinal cord injury. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:

133L.N. Novikova et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 132–142individual therapies are unlikely to provide a panacea for spinal cord
repair and rather a combinations of strategies could lead to
improvements in outcome after spinal injury (Bunge, 2008; Lu and
Tuszynski, 2008). The growth-promoting effect of OEC could be
significantly improved by combining OECs with Schwann cells and
chondroitinase treatment to overcome inhibition of the glial scar
(Bretzner et al., 2010; Fouad et al., 2009b). It also has been
demonstrated that OEC can attenuate degeneration of axotomized
descending neurons after spinal cord injury (Xiao et al., 2005) and
retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve lesion (Wu et al., 2010).
Nevertheless, the growing number of reports had questioned the
efficacy of OEC to promote spinal cord repair (Aoki et al., 2010;
Barakat et al., 2005; Bretzner et al., 2010; Collazos-Castro et al., 2005;
Lu et al., 2006; Steward et al., 2006). It has been proposed that
functional recovery after OEC transplantation could be supported by
collateral sprouting (Bradbury and McMahon, 2006; Toft et al., 2007)
and migrating host Schwann cells (Boyd et al., 2005) rather than by
axonal regeneration across the lesion site. The discrepancy in results
could be attributed to many factors including the source of tissue used
to obtain the OEC, the age and the purity of transplanted cells and the
methodology used in culture preparation (Barnett and Riddell, 2007;
Kawaja et al., 2009; Nieto-Sampedro, 2003; Raisman and Li, 2007).
Moreover, the type of spinal cord injury, the timing and the location of
grafts within the injured spinal cord could also influence the outcome
of OEC transplantation.
The present study investigates whether OEC harvested from the
adult rat olfactory bulbs and purified with a method of differential
adhesion (Nash et al., 2001; Sasaki et al., 2004) or with immunomag-
netic beads (Gudino-Cabrera and Nieto-Sampedro, 1996; Lopez-Vales
et al., 2007) could stimulate axonal regrowth across the lesion site and
support survival and sprouting of axotomized rubrospinal neurons
after cervical spinal cord hemisection in adult rats. Since transplan-
tation into the injured human spinal cord will require large quantities
of OEC and, therefore, could increase the time in culture, we compared
growth-promoting and neuroprotective effects of short-term and
long-term cultured cells.
Materials and methods
Experimental animals
The experiments were performed on adult (10–12 weeks, n=96)
female Sprague–Dawley rats (Taconic Europe A/S, Denmark). The
animal care and experimental procedures were carried out in
accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (86/
609/EEC) and were also approved by the Northern Swedish
Committee for Ethics in Animal Experiments. All surgical procedures
were performed under general anesthesia using a mixture of
ketamine (Ketalar®, Parke-Davis; 100 mg/kg i.v.) and xylazine
(Rompun®, Bayer; 10 mg/kg i.v.).
Culture of olfactory ensheathing cells
Primary cultures of olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) were obtained
using previously described technique (Novikova et al., 2006; Pettersson
et al., 2010; Ramon-Cueto andNieto-Sampedro, 1994). Adult female rats
(n=25)were killedwith an overdoseof sodiumpentobarbital (240 mg/
kg, Apoteks-bolaget, Sweden) and the olfactory bulbs (OB) were
dissected into Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen AB,
Täby, Sweden) andcleaned fromblood clots andmeninges. Theolfactory
nerve and glomerular layers were separated under the microscope, cut
into small pieces and collected into Ca2+ and Mg2+-free HBSS. After
washing inHBSS, the tissuewasdissociatedusing0.1% trypsin for 15 min
at 37 °C. The enzymatic activity was stopped with a mixture of DMEM
and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1; Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB, Stockholm,
Sweden) supplementedwith 2 mMglutamine, 10 U/mlpenicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/mlgentamycin and10% fetal calf serum, FCS (“D/
F-10S medium” from Ramon-Cueto and Nieto-Sampedro, 1994). The
digestant was centrifuged at 800 rpm for 3 min, re-suspended and
triturated 5–7 times through a fire-polished, siliconized Pasteur pipette
and5–7 times through a 21 Gneedle. Since the resultingprimary culture
contained a mixture of OEC, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and astrocytes,
purification of OECwas achieved using amethod of differential adhesion
(a-OEC) (Nashet al., 2001)or immunomagnetic beads (b-OEC) (Gudino-
Cabrera and Nieto-Sampedro, 1996; Lopez-Vales et al., 2007).
The method of differential adhesion is based on a very low
adhesion rate of OEC to the surface of uncoated culture flasks (Nash et
al., 2001). The cell suspension obtained from each pair of OB was re-
suspended in D/F-10S culture medium, seeded on uncoated Lab-Tek®
one-chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International Corp) and cultured at
37 °C with 5% CO2. After 18 h, the supernatant was removed and re-
plated on another uncoated Lab-Tek® slide and incubated for
additional 36–48 h. The supernatants from three chamber slides (6
olfactory bulbs from 3 rats) were removed and re-plated on 25 cm2
poly-L-lysine-coated culture flask with D/F-10S culture medium.
During the procedure, most of the non-OEC cells attached to the
uncoated chamber slides (Nash et al., 2001). The culture was
incubated for another 48 h to allow OEC to adhere to the poly-L-
lysine-coated surface of culture flask. After removing the medium the
cells were washed with Ca2+ and Mg2+-free HBSS. The resulting
purity of a-OEC was 93–95%.
The immonumagnetic purification of OEC was performed on 1-
week-old primary cultures using sheep anti-rabbit Dynabeads (M280;
Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway) conjugated to low-affinity NGF receptor IgG
(p75; Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB, Stockholm, Sweden and Chemicon
International, Ltd., Malmö, Sweden) according to manufacturer's
recommendation. The Dynabeads were incubated with p75 IgG for
24 h at 4 °C (2.5 μg of IgG for 107 of Dynabeads) and then with OEC
suspension for 1 h at 4 °C (about 10 Dynabeads per target cell). After
washing and re-suspension, OEC were placed on 25 cm2 poly-L-
lysine-coated culture flasks and kept at 37 °C, 95% humidity and 5%
CO2. The resulting purity of b-OEC was about 80%.
The cultureswere expandedusing threedifferent growthmediums:
1) D/F-10S (Ramon-Cueto and Nieto-Sampedro, 1994), 2) DMEM-10S
with 2 μM forskolin and 20 μg/ml pituitary extract (Invitrogen AB,
Täby, Sweden) as mitogens (Pastrana et al., 2006; Ramon-Cueto et al.,
1998; Ramon-Cueto et al., 2000; Rubio et al., 2008) and3)D/F-10Swith
2 μM forskolin and recombinant human glial growth factor-2 (GGF2,
40 ng/ml, Acorda Therapeutics, Inc., Hawthorne, NY) as mitogens
(Alexander et al., 2002; Chuah et al., 2000; Yan et al., 2001). The
medium was changed every second day and for in vitro experiments
cells were maintained in culture for 20 weeks. Population doublings
and cumulative growth rate were calculated in a-OEC cultures
according to the formula PD=log (number of cells harvested/number
of cells seeded)/log 2 as described previously by Rubio et al., 2008). For
in vivo experiments, the time from OB dissection to OEC transplanta-
tion was either 3 weeks (short-term cultured cells, OEC ST) or 7 weeks
(long-term cultured cells, OEC LT) and cells were expanded using
growth medium D/F-10S with forskolin and GGF2. The timing was
based on ourpreliminaryfindings thatOEC cultured for 7 and20 weeks
had the same neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects after
spinal cord transplantation (unpublished observation). The purity of
transplanted OEC was assessed using immunostaining for p75
receptors and S100 protein (see below). OEC were sub-cultured on
Lab-Tek® 8-chambers slides at a density of 15,000 cells per well for
2 days and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (pH=7.4) at room temperature for 20 min.
Labeling of OEC
For labeling with fluorescent dye Fast Blue (Sigma-Aldrich Sweden
AB, Stockholm, Sweden), cells were detached from culture flasks with
Trypsin/EDTA and concentrated in the growth medium to 1–3×106
cells/ml. Fast Bluewas added to cell suspension at concentration 5 μl/ml
for 15 min at 37 °C. After labeling, the cells were gently washed, plated
in 25 cm2 poly-L-lysine-coated culture flasks with growth medium and
kept for additional 72 h before transplantation into spinal cord
(Pettersson et al., 2010).
To express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in OEC (Fig. 1E), we
used retroviral expression system. Retroviral packaging cell line PT67
(Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) was propagated in high glucose DMEM
(Invitrogen AB, Täby, Sweden) supplemented with penicillin, 100 U/
ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml (Invitrogen AB, Täby, Sweden) and 10%
FCS and transfected with a retroviral expression vector pLEGFPpuro.
The GFP expression vector pLEGFPpuro resulted from substitution of
the neomycin resistance gene in the retroviral vector pLEGFP-N1
(Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) by the puromycin resistance gene from
pMSCVpuro (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA). The transfection of PT67 cells
was done by a lipofection method with Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, USA) according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. Successfully transfected cells were selected with
puromycin and maintained (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA). For virus
production, the packaging cells were seeded at confluence about 60%,
incubated overnight at 37 °C and transferred into a 32 °C incubator
with 95% humidity and 5% CO2. After 72 h, virus containing medium
was collected and filtered through 0.45 μm low-protein binding filter
(Pall Corporation, Cornwall, UK). For transduction, OEC were seeded
at a density of 5×103 cells per cm2 and 2 days later their growth

polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, USA). The cells were kept at
32 °C for 24 h. After transduction, the viral medium was changed to a
fresh OEC growth medium. Transduction efficacy was about 40%.
Following incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, the GFP-positive cells were
separated from non-transduced cells by fluorescence activated cell
sorter technique (FACS DiVa, BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA).
Spinal cord injury and transplantation
After cervical laminectomy, the lateral funiculus and adjacent gray
matter of the C4 spinal cord segment were transected on the left side.
The rats were randomly divided into experimental groups receiving
different treatments: (i) spinal cord injury (SCI) without treatment
(SCI, n=17), (ii) SCI followed by transplantation of short-term
cultured a-OEC (a-OEC ST, n=14), (iii) SCI followed by transplanta-
tion of long-term cultured a-OEC (a-OEC LT, n=17) and (iv) SCI
followed by transplantation of short-term cultured b-OEC (b-OEC ST,
n=13). Transplantation of long-term cultured b-OEC was not per-
formed since our results in vitro (see Results, Olfactory ensheathing
cell culture) demonstrated that it was not possible to maintain 80%
purity of b-OEC for more than 2–3 weeks due to contamination with
non-OEC cells. Five rats at 1 week after Fast Blue application to the
lumbar spinal cord and 5 rats at 1 week after anterograde labeling of
rubrospinal axons with biotinylated dextran amine (“control” in
histograms) served as baseline controls.
For transplantation, the cells cultured inD/F-10Swith 2 μMforskolin
and recombinant human GGF-2 were detached with Trypsin/EDTA,
washed and concentrated to 105 cells/μl in the growthmediumwithout
serum. After transfer into a siliconized glass micropipette (outer
diameter 100 μm) attached to a 5 μl Hamiltone syringe, 1.5–1.6 μl of
the cell suspension (150,000–160,000 cells) was slowly (10 min)
pressure-injected into the lateral funiculus (depths 1.0 mm) at
approximately 1 mm rostral and 1 mm caudal to the lesion site using
Stoelting's Lab Standard Stereotaxic Instrument (Stoelting Co., USA).
The micropipette was left in place for additional 2–3 min. Dura mater
was covered with stretched parafilm and Spongostan®, muscles and
skin were closed in layers, and the rats were given analgesic Finadyne
(Schering-Plough, Denmark; 2.5 mg/kg, i.m.), saline (2 ml s.c.) and
benzylpenicillin (Boehringer Ingelheim; 60 mg i.m.).
Retrograde labeling of rubrospinal neurons
In the experiments dealing with neuronal survival, rubrospinal
neurons were labeled with retrograde tracer 1 week before SCI
(Novikova et al., 2002). Following a laminectomy, the L1 spinal cord
segment was exposed and the dorsal portion of the left lateral
funiculus including the rubrospinal tract was transected with a fine
scissors under an operating microscope. A small pellet prepared from
1 to 2 μl of a 2% aqueous solution of the non-toxic fluorescent tracer
Fast Blue (Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB) was placed into the lesion
cavity and covered with a thin sheet of parafilm and a small piece of
Spongostan®.
Anterograde tracing of rubrospinal axons
Anterograde labeling of rubrospinal axons was performed as
described by us previously (Novikova et al., 2002). In brief, at
12 weeks after spinal cord injury, the rats were mounted in a
stereotaxic frame and a 2 mm hole was drilled in the skull to allow
access to the red nucleus. A glass micropipette (outer tip diameter 40–
50 μm) filled with a 10% solution of biotinylated dextran amine in
saline (BDA; 10 000 MW, lysine fixable, Molecular Probes) was used
for stereotaxic insertions into the magnocellular and parvicellular
regions of the red nucleus (6.6 and 6.1 mm caudal to the bregma,
0.7 mm lateral to the midline, and 7.2 mm ventral to the bregma)
135L.N. Novikova et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 132–142using Stoelting's Lab Standard Stereotaxic Instrument (Stoelting Co.,
USA). BDA was injected iontophoretically by passing anodal current
pulses of 10 μA (7 s on/7 s off) through the microelectrode for 10 min.
The microelectrode was then left in place for additional 2–3 min.
Tissue processing
At 3, 8 and 13 weeks the animals were deeply anesthetizedwith an
intraperitoneal overdose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially
perfused with Tyrode's solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). In the experiments using ante-
rograde BDA-labeling, the fixation consisted of a mixture of 4%
paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH=7.4). Spinal cord segments C3–C5 and the brain stemwere then
removed and transferred into the same fixative. For immunohisto-
chemistry, spinal cord segments C3–C5 were post-fixed for 1–2 h,
cryoprotected in 10% and 20% sucrose for 2–3 days and frozen in
liquid isopentane. Serial longitudinal 16-μm-thick sections were cut
on a cryomicrotome (Leica Instruments, Germany), thaw-mounted in
pairs onto SuperFrost®Plus slides, dried overnight at room temper-
ature and stored at −85 °C before processing. For fluorescence
microscopy and cell counts, 50-μm-thick serial transverse sections
from the midbrain were cut on a vibratome (Leica Instruments,
Germany), mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, air dried, shortly
immersed in xylene and coverslipped in DPX (Kebo Lab AB, Sweden).
For demonstration of anterogradely BDA-labeled rubrospinal axons
and arborizations, serial 50-μm-thick transverse sections (C3 spinal
cord segments) and longitudinal sections (C4–C5 spinal cord
segments) were cut on a cryomicrotome or vibratome and processed
according to a modified ABC method (Novikova et al., 2002). Briefly,
free-floating sections were washed in PBS, incubated for 6 h at room
temperature with avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex (1:1:100; Vec-
tor Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100
and 1% bovine serum albumin, developed in a solution containing
0.05% of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Sigma),
0.06% NiCl2 and 0.003% H2O2, mounted on glass slides, counterstained
with cresyl violet and coverslipped in DPX.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining was performed on longitudinal 16-μm-thick
spinal cord sections and cells cultured on Lab-Tek® slides. After
blocking with normal serum, the following primary antibodies were
used: mouse anti-low-affinity NGF p75 receptor (1:200; Chemicon
International, Ltd.), mouse anti-Thy 1.1 (1:1000; MAB1406 Chemi-
con), rabbit anti-S-100 protein (1:1000; Dakopatts AB, Älvsjö,
Sweden), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500; Dakopatts AB, Älvsjö, Sweden),
rabbit anti-serotonin, (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB), rabbit
anti-CGRP (1:1000; Chemicon International, Ltd.), rabbit anti-GFP
(1:500; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), and a cocktail of monoclonal
antibodies reacting with 68, 160 and 200 kDa neurofilament proteins
(pan-NF; 1:200; Zymed; Labora AB, Sollentuna, Sweden). All primary
antibodies were applied for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing in
PBS, secondary goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies Alexa
Fluor® 488 and Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:300; Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) were applied for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.
The slides were coverslipped with Vectashield® mounting medium
(Vector Laboratories). The staining specificity was tested by omission
of primary antibodies.
Counts of Fast Blue-labeled rubrospinal neurons
The nuclear profiles of the retrogradely labeled neurons were
counted in all sections through the red nucleus at 250×magnification.
The total number of profiles was not corrected for split nuclei, since
the nuclear diameters were small in comparison with the sectionthickness used (Novikova et al., 2000, 2002). We have previously
demonstrated that the accuracy of this technique in estimation of
retrograde cell death is similar to that obtained with physical disector
method (Ma et al., 2001) and counts of neurons reconstructed from
serial sections (Novikov et al., 1997).
Counts of rubrospinal axons and arborizations
Rubrospinal sprouting was studied in 20 randomly selected
transverse sections from the C2 spinal cord segment of normal rats
and at 13 weeks after SCI and cell transplantation as described
previously (Novikova et al., 2002). Rubrospinal arborizations in
lamina V of the C2 spinal segment were captured in four non-
overlapping areas at 2000 final magnification with a Nikon DXM1200
digital camera and imported into Matrox Inspector 3.1 software
(Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Quebec, Canada). The final image size
was 1280×1024 pixels and corresponded to the area of 54.18×
43.35 μm. The number of labeled profiles and the relative tissue area
occupied by labeled profiles were quantified for each image at a
constant discrimination level and an average value was calculated for
each section. After counting the number of labeled rubrospinal stem
axons in the lateral funiculus in five randomly selected sections at
250× final magnification, values describing the mean number of
arborizations per labeled stem axon were calculated.
Image processing
Preparations were photographed with a Nikon DXM1200 digital
camera attached to a Leitz microscope. The captured images were
resized, grouped into a single canvas and labeled using Adobe
Photoshop software. The contrast and brightness were adjusted to
provide optimal clarity.
Statistical analysis
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc
Newman–Keuls Multiple Comparison Test was used to determine
statistical differences between the experimental groups (Prism®,
GraphPad Software, Inc; San Diego, CA).
Results
Olfactory ensheathing cell culture
Primary OEC cultures in the present study contained about 35–40%
of cells immunopositive for low-affinity NGF receptor p75 (Fig. 1A).
After purification with the method of differential adhesion, 93–95% of
cells in cultures were immunostained for p75 receptors, S-100 protein
and GFAP (Fig. 1B,C,D). The majority of non-OEC cells were Thy 1.1-
positive cells. In our attempts to maintain pure long-term cultures of
a-OEC for intraspinal transplantation, we followed well known
protocols using growth medium D/F-10S alone or with DMEM-10S
supplemented with forskolin and pituitary extract. With D/F-10S
medium cultures became contaminated with non-OEC cells already
after 1 week (Fig. 2) and the proportion of p75-positive and S-100-
positive cells was reduced to 42% (Pb0.001) and 35% (Pb0.001),
respectively. With DMEM-10S medium supplemented with forskolin
and pituitary extract the proportion of p75- and S-100-positive cells
remained within 80–90% during the first week after purification, but
after 2 weeks in culture it reduced drastically to 15–18% (Pb0.0001;
Fig. 2). Surprisingly, D/F-10S medium supplemented with forskolin
and recombinant human GGF2 maintained 90–95% pure a-OEC for at
least 11 weeks (Fig. 2). Purification of primary cultures with
immunomagnetic beads resulted in most cases in 80% OEC purity.
Immediately after purification, numerous Dynabeads remained
attached to the cell surface (Fig. 1F). The number of attached
136 L.N. Novikova et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 132–142Dynabeads was reduced after 2 weeks in culture but they still can be
found in spinal cord sections 13 weeks after transplantation (data not
shown). In contrast to a-OEC, we found that with all growth mediums
tested, it was not possible to maintain 80% pure b-OEC cultures for
more than 2–3 weeks due to contamination with Thy 1.1-positive and
p75-/S100-negative non-OEC cells.
Distribution of olfactory ensheathing cells
Three weeks after transplantation, numerous GFP-labeled OEC
(Fig. 1E) were present in the injection sites rostral and caudal to the
spinal cord hemisection and in the trauma zone (Fig. 3A). The trauma
zone was connected with both injection sites by narrow tract formed
by transplanted OEC. However, we did not find any OEC migration
rostral and caudal from the injection sites. The number of GFP-OEC

The changes where mainly seen in the trauma zone where only single
GFP-positive cells could be detected (compare Fig. 3C and D). Since
the reduction in GFP-OEC number could be due to down regulation of
GFP expression (Vroemen et al., 2005), we also transplanted Fast
Blue-labeled OEC (Pettersson et al., 2010) and found that distribution
of these cells at 8 weeks after SCI was similar to GFP-OEC (Fig. 3B and
E) with a predominant concentration of labeled cells at the injection
sites (Fig. 3F). Immunostainingwith p75 antiserum revealed that p75-
immunoreactivity coincided with labeled cells in the transplantation
sites but in the trauma zone it was beyond the areas occupied by GFP-
and Fast Blue-positive OEC (Fig. 3A,B,E). In addition, animals
transplanted with short-term cultured OEC (OEC ST) had larger
areas of p75-immunostaining in the injection sites (Fig. 3G,H) than
animals with long-term cultured OEC (OEC LT; Fig. 3I).
Survival of rubrospinal neurons
In the control animals 1 week after Fast Blue application to the
lumbar spinal cord, the red nucleus contained 1704±58 labeled
neuronal profiles with nucleus (mean±S.E.M.). Most of the labeled
neurons were located in the ventral portion of the magnocellular and
parvicellular regions of the red nucleus. At 8 weeks after cervical C4
SCI only 54% of labeled rubrospinal neurons remained in the nucleus
(Pb0.001; Fig. 4A) andmost of them exhibited significant cell atrophy
(data not shown). Transplantation of b-OEC ST increased survival rate
to 84% (Pb0.001; b-OEC ST vs. SCI; Fig. 4A) whereas transplantation of
a-OEC ST protected 69% of the rubrospinal neurons (Pb0.05; a-OEC ST
vs. SCI; Fig. 4A). In contrast, transplantation of a-OEC LT had no effect
on retrograde cell death after SCI (Fig. 4A).
Axonal sprouting and regeneration
Quantification of BDA-labeled axonal profiles in the C2 cervical
dorsolateral funiculus at 13 weeks after SCI revealed that the density of
rubrospinal axons was significantly reduced to 30% of normal control
(Pb0.001; Fig. 4B). In comparison with SCI, transplantation of a-OEC LT
hadno effects (PN0.05; Fig. 4B–D). In contrast, transplantation b-OEC ST
induced moderate increase of the density of rubrospinal stem axons
within the dorsolateral funiculus (Pb0.05; Fig. 4B) and, at the same
time, reduced the density of terminal arborizations in the gray matter
(Pb0.05; Fig. 4C). Transplantation of a-OEC ST restored the density of
rubrospinal stem axons to 84% of control values (Pb0.001; Fig. 4B) and
increased by 156% the density of rubrospinal terminations in lamina V
(Pb0.001; a-OEC ST vs. control; Fig. 4C). However, after relating the
number of labeled arborizations in the gray matter to the number of
labeled rubrospinal axons in the dorsolateral funiculus, a significant
decrease in the number of arborizations per stem axon was found after
transplantation of both b-OEC ST (Pb0.001; Fig. 4D) and a-OEC ST
(Pb0.05; Fig. 4D). It seems, therefore, that despite a significant
neuroprotective effect on red nucleus neurons, transplantation of
short-term cultured OEC is accompanied by diminished sprouting of
rubrospinal terminals rostral to the injury site.
At 13 weeks after SCI, pan-neurofilament (panNF) immunolabel-
ing revealed only single nerve fibers in the lesion site. BDA injections
into the red nucleus demonstrated that labeled rubrospinal axons
approached the rostral border of the trauma zone but then suddenly
changed their direction and grew in parallel to the scar tissue towards
the contralateral gray matter (data not shown). Surprisingly and
despite the marked survival effect on rubrospinal neurons, transplan-
tation of b-OEC ST stimulated regrowth neither of panNF-immuno-
labeled nerve fibers nor rubrospinal axons (Fig. 5A,C). The same
negative results were also obtained with a-OEC LT (Fig. 5B,D). In
contrast, at 8–13 weeks after transplantation of a-OEC ST, numerous
panNF-positive fibers bridged the lesion site (Fig. 5E,G) and sprouted
within the trauma zone (Fig. 5F,H). BDA-labeled rubrospinal axons
137L.N. Novikova et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 132–142(Fig. 6A–C) and serotonin-positive raphaespinal axons (Fig. 6E–I)
crossed the injury site along the lateral border but grew for only about
1500 μm in the white and gray matter of the distal spinal cord.
Sensory axons immunostained for calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP)were foundmainly within the trauma zone (Fig. 6D). Thus, the
method of culture preparation could influence growth-promoting
effect of OEC after intraspinal transplantation.
Discussion
The present study shows that the age of cells in culture and the
method of cell purification could influence the neuroprotective and
growth-promoting effects of OEC transplants. Although purified OEC
can be maintained for several months in culture without losing their
p75 and S100 immunoreactivity, only short-term cultured cells
attenuated massive retrograde cell death in the red nucleus and

method of differential cell adhesion and with immunomagnetic beads
had different effects on axonal growth. OEC separated with Dyna-
beads (b-OEC) failed to promote regrowth across the lesion site but
increased the number of rubrospinal fibers in the white matter rostral
to the hemisection. In contrast, OEC purified with a method of
differential adhesion (a-OEC), stimulated growth from the descending
rubrospinal and raphaespinal tracts and from the sensory CGRP-
positive fibers. In addition, after intraspinal transplantation, labeled
OEC showed very limited migration and were found mainly at the

138 L.N. Novikova et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 132–142Factors determining the outcome of OEC transplantation
Transplantation of OEC has been shown to support axonal
regeneration, myelination and neuronal survival in different exper-
imental models of spinal cord injury (Fouad et al., 2009a; Kocsis et al.,
2009; Lindsay et al., 2010; Munoz-Quiles et al., 2009; Radtke and
Wewetzer, 2009). However, reports from different laboratories have
demonstrated considerable variations in results ranging from signif-
icant axonal regeneration across the lesion site and functional
recovery (Gorrie et al., 2010; Keyvan-Fouladi et al., 2003; Lopez-
Vales et al., 2007; Ramon-Cueto et al., 2000; Takeoka et al., 2010) to
very little or no effect after spinal cord repair (Aoki et al., 2010;
Barakat et al., 2005; Bretzner et al., 2010; Collazos-Castro et al., 2005;
Lu et al., 2006; Steward et al., 2006). The conflicting data regarding the
ability of OEC to support axonal regeneration have been reviewed
(Barnett and Riddell, 2007; Nieto-Sampedro, 2003; Raisman and Li,
2007; Richter and Roskams, 2008) and the factors which could
potentially determine the outcome of OEC transplantation have been
discussed. Although there is no consensus in the ongoing discussion
about significance of these factors of importance for OEC transplan-
tation into spinal cord injury (Barnett and Riddell, 2007; Deumens et
al., 2006; Lu et al., 2006), the source of tissue used to obtain the OEC
(neonatal and adult olfactory bulb and olfactory mucosa), the
senescence and the purity of transplanted cells and the methodology
used in the culture preparation seem to be the most important
variables (Pastrana et al., 2006, 2007; Richter et al., 2005; Santos-
Benito and Ramon-Cueto, 2003). However, direct comparisons made

grafts revealed that the donor age, the purity of the cells and the
presence of an endogenously produced matrix are not related to the
discrepancy in results found in OEC transplant studies (Andrews and
Stelzner, 2004; Deumens et al., 2006; Toft et al., 2007). Also the initial
findings that OEC from the lamina propria are more beneficial for
spinal cord repair than the cells from the olfactory bulb (Richter et al.,
2005) have not been confirmed in a subsequent study (Lu et al., 2006).
However, in studies dealing with demyelination in the rat and porcine
spinal cord, it has been found that the purity of cell cultures and the
senescence of OEC could significantly influence remyelination
(Lakatos et al., 2003; Radtke et al., 2010). The results of the present
study, however, confirm previous observations that prolonged cell
cultures reduce stimulatory effect of OEC and, in addition, demon-
strate that the technique of cell purification could modulate growth-
promoting effect of OEC after transplantation into spinal cord.
Long-term cultured OEC failed to support regeneration and neuronal
survival
The mechanisms underlying the lack of neurotrophic and growth-
promoting effects of long-term cultured OEC are not clear. They could
be attributed to the low survival rate of transplanted OEC (Pearse et
al., 2007) and to the loss of certain classes of surface receptors which
are important for interaction with surrounding glial cells, macro-
phages and regenerating axons. In this respect, the results show that

139L.N. Novikova et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 132–142vitro, transplantation sited with long-term cultured OEC have lower
levels of p75 expression than with short-term cultured cells. Also, it
has been recently demonstrated that in contrast to primate OEC, adult
rat and porcine OEC could become senescent already after 3–5 weeks
in culture and lose their phenotypic properties (Radtke et al., 2010;
Rubio et al., 2008). Moreover, it has been found that if culture period is
extended for several weeks beyond senescence, OEC can resume
division and undergo spontaneous immortalization (Rubio et al.,
2008; Sonigra et al., 1996).
Another possible explanation could be related to the reports that
OEC express and naturally secrete several classes of neurotrophic
molecules including NGF, NT-4/5, BDNF and GDNF (Lipson et al., 2003;
Pastrana et al., 2007; Sasaki et al., 2006) which are known to promote
neuronal survival and axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury
(Deumens et al., 2005) However, after prolonged time in culture OEC

lose their neuroprotective effect after intraspinal transplantation. This
hypothesis is supported by findings that extracellular BDNF is
produced in significant amounts by the early passage OEC whereas
the neurotrophin is absent in the extracellular medium collected from
the late passage cells (Pastrana et al., 2007). Moreover, long-term
cultured OEC have very low levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2
which seems to be an important modulator of OEC-mediated axonal
regeneration (Pastrana et al., 2006). The latter results are in line with
observations that long-term cultured OEC are less efficient in inducing
neurite outgrowth in vitro (Au et al., 2007; Pastrana et al., 2006, 2007).
Recently a new growth-promoting factor, the SPARC (secreted
protein acidic rich in cystein) (osteonectin), has been identified in
OEC conditioned medium (Au et al., 2007). It has been demonstrated
that SPARC is an OEC-derived matricellular protein which could

regeneration via laminin-1 and TGFβ signaling. However, it also has
been shown that early P2 passage OEC have 30–50% higher levels of
SPARC expression than late P6 passage cells (Au et al., 2007).
With respect to neuroprotective effect of the short-term cultured
OEC, our findings are in line with previous reports that OEC
transplantation into the injured spinal cord could protect descending
corticospinal neurons from retrograde degeneration (Sasaki et al.,
2006). Biochemical analysis performed in the latter study demon-
strates significantly elevate levels of BDNF in the spinal cord injury
zone at 1 week after OEC transplantation but no difference is detected
in NGF and NT-3 levels. Moreover, olfactory neural progenitors from
the olfactory mucosa, with the capacity to generate both neurons and
OEC, have been found to produce BDNF and to rescue axotomized red
nucleus neurons after SCI (Xiao et al., 2005).
It has previously been shown that neurotrophic factors could not
only prevent retrograde degeneration but also support regeneration
of rubrospinal neurons in different models of spinal cord injury
(Kobayashi et al., 1997; Novikova et al., 2000; Storer et al., 2003;
Tobias et al., 2003). However, varying outcomes of rubrospinal

complete spinal cord transection (Cao et al., 2004) or moderate
contusion injury (Plant et al., 2003), significant increase in the
number of retrogradely labeled neurons have been found in the red
nucleus. The present study also demonstrated growth-promoting
effect of short-term cultured a-OEC on rubrospinal neurons. In
contrast, after less-severe injury to the dorsolateral funiculus,
anterograde tracing reveals no regeneration of rubrospinal axons
across the lesion site into the distal cord (Bretzner et al., 2010;
Ruitenberg et al., 2003).
Method of cell purification could affect growth-promoting effect of OEC
transplant
The limited effects of b-OEC on regeneration were unexpected
because it has been previously shown that the same method of
purification with immunomagnetic Dynabeads results in OEC grafts
capable of inducing significant regenerative response after transplan-
tation into completely transected rat spinal cord (Lopez-Vales et al.,
2006, 2007). However, immunomagnetic beads separate only OEC

141L.N. Novikova et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 132–142with sufficiently strong expression of p75 receptors leaving all other
OEC subtypes in the supernatant. It has also been demonstrated that
the major OEC population in primary cells suspensions does not
initially express p75 receptors but upregulates them after several days
in culture (Wewetzer et al., 2005). Thus, it is possible that in contrast
to previous reports (Lopez-Vales et al., 2006, 2007), we separated
different subtypes of OEC which had marked neuroprotective effect
but failed to promote axonal regrowth. Another possibility is that
remaining on the cell surface Dynabeads could interfere with the
processes of interaction between transplanted OEC and surrounding
host cells including reactive astrocytes.
However, it is not clear why short-term cultured a-OEC are less
effective in rescuing rubrospinal neurons than b-OEC but are much
more effective in stimulating axonal regrowth across the trauma zone.
One possibility is that the signaling pathways promoting neuronal
survival and axonal regeneration respond differently to neurotrophic
factors and that efficient neuroprotection of axotomized neurons is
not a sufficient prerequisite for axonal regeneration (Lu et al., 2001;
Novikova et al., 2002). Another interesting observation in the present
study is that the neuroprotective effect of the short-term cultured OEC
is associated with reduced rubrospinal sprouting. The same effects on
lesioned rubrospinal neurons have been described previously after
prolonged intrathecal infusion of BDNF and NT-3 (Novikova et al.,
2002).
In summary, the present study demonstrates that the age of cells in
culture and the method of cell purification have influence on the
growth-promoting and neuroprotective effects of OEC after trans-
plantation into the injured spinal cord. The finding that methods of
culture preparation might affect the outcome of OEC transplantation
could be an important issue since human trials with OEC have been
conducted in several countries (Dobkin et al., 2006; Kay-Sim et al.,
2008).
