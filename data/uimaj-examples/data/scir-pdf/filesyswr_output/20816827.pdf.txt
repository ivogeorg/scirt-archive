Autologous transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) and Schwann cells (SCs) is considered a
promising option to promote axonal regrowth and remyelination after spinal cord injury in humans.
However, if the experimental data from the rodent model can be directly extrapolated to humans, as widely
believed, remains to be established. While limitations of the rodent system have recently been discussed with
regard to the distinct organization of the motor systems, the question whether OECs and SCs may display
species-specific properties has not been fully addressed. Prompted by recent studies on canine and porcine
glia, we performed a detailed analysis of the in vitro and in vivo properties of OECs and SCs and show that
rodent but not human, monkey, porcine, and canine glia require mitogens for in vitro expansion, display a
complex response to elevated intracellular cAMP, and undergo spontaneous immortalization upon prolonged
mitogen stimulation. These data indicate fundamental inter-species differences of the control of cellular
proliferation. Whether OECs and SCs from large animals and humans share growth-promoting in vivo
properties with their rodent counterpart is not yet clear. Autologous implantation studies in humans did not
reveal adverse effects of cell transplantation so far. However, in vivo studies of large animal or human glia and
rodent recipients mainly focused on the remyelinating potential of the transplanted cells. Thus, furtherIntroduction

Species-specific control of cellular proliferation and the impact of large animal
models for the use of olfactory ensheathing cells and Schwann cells in spinal
cord repair
y Kocsis e, Wolfgang Baumgärtner a,cNeurologynt in vivo studies have provided evidence that
olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) and Schwann
cells (SCs) into the lesioned central and peripheral nervous system
promotes both axonal regeneration and remyelination (Lankford
et al., 2002; Wewetzer et al., 2002; Santos-Benito and Ramón-Cueto
2003; Lavdas et al., 2008). Thus, transplantation of growth-promoting
glia, such as OECs and SCs is considered a promising option for the
treatment of nervous system injury and disease (Kocsis, 1999;
Franssen et al., 2007, Radtke et al., 2010b). However, due to the
limited availability of human tissue, the vast majority of studies have
been carried out in rodents and very little is known about human
OECs and SCs (Radtke and Wewetzer, 2009). Currently, we face a
situationwhere awealth of experimental data from rodents faces only
few clinical phase I studies in humans (Féron et al., 2005; Lima et al.,
2006, 2010; Mackay-Sim et al., 2008). So far only a few investigations
used glia from large animals to study the regenerative capacity of
OECs and SCs within the same experimental paradigm (for review, see
Wewetzer et al., 2002; Wewetzer and Brandes, 2006). This is due to
the fact that research on the regenerative potential of OECs and its
translation into clinical practice in the past has been dominated by
two main assumptions. First, it is generally believed that OECs, which
are associated in situ with olfactory neurons entering the olfactory
bulb throughout life-time (Graziadei and Monti Graziadei, 1985,
Raisman, 1985) display unique regenerative properties that are
superior to the ones of SCs from the peripheral nerve (Ramón-Cueto
and Valverde, 1995; Franklin and Barnett, 1997; Lankford et al., 2008;
Kocsis et al., 2009). Second, it was hypothesized that human OECs and
SCs behave similarly if not identical as their rodent counterpart. As a
consequence of the former assumption, in vivo effects of OECs were
mainly characterized in relation to vehicle solution controls rather
than in direct comparison with the closely related SCs (for review, see
Wewetzer et al., 2002; Wewetzer and Brandes, 2006).
The fact that putative species-specific effects of OECs and SCs have
not been discussed so far is also a result of the second hypothesis. The
thorough review of the current literature clearly reveals (see below,
Table 1) that primate or human OECs have been regularly maintained
so far in vitro according to protocols originally established for rodent
cells. Instead, it would be important to clarify and investigate
independently the importance and relevance of certain factors, such
as an elevated intracellular cAMP level, for the in vitro growth of
primate and human glia. The idea that the rodent data can be
extrapolated to the human system also becomes apparent when
analyzing the in vivo approaches. Considering the experimental data
currently available it seems that the gap between the species, rodents
and humans, is at least as relevant as the literal gap in spinal cord
injury.
To translate the rodent data into clinical practice, it is essential to
do a comparative analysis between the species and to answer two
major questions. First, are there any differences in the organization of
the motor systems between rodents and humans relevant to the
clinical application of growth-promoting glia? And second, do human
OECs and SCs display species-specific properties different from
rodents? If the answer is yes, the next step should be the identification
of species with closest homology to the human system. Whereas the
former issue has been recently covered by Courtine et al. (2007), who
recommended the use of nonhuman primates as translational models,
a critical and comparative analysis of OECs and SCs has not been done
so far. On a methodological level, it is important to analyze the
protocols designed for cell isolation since distinct protocols may lead
to the cultivation of different cell types resulting in varying results,
including cell purity (Kawaja et al., 2009). Another level refers to the
functional capacity of the cells and the question, in how far rodent glia

determined either by in vitro analysis or by implantation of the cells
into the rodent or large animal/human spinal cord.
In the present review, we performed a detailed comparative in
vitro and in vivo analysis of published properties of OECs from
different species, such as monkeys, dogs, and pigs. Though adult dogs
and pigs were initially introduced as models for in vivo studies
(Imaizumi et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2002, Radtke et al. 2004; Jeffery
et al., 2005, 2006), a detailed in vitro characterization of the cells has
not been done until recently in the dog (Krudewig et al., 2006; Bock
et al., 2007; Techangamsuwan et al., 2008, 2009; Haastert et al., 2009;
Schmitte et al., 2009) or has just begun as in the pig (Radtke et al.,
2010a). The same is true for human cells that have been implanted in
the rat or into humans but whose in vitro characterization has
remained fragmentary. We include SCs in our analysis, since many of
the aspects of glial cell properties were originally studied in SCs and
the number of papers that focused on the direct comparison of OECs
and SCs are still scarce (Angelov et al., 2005; Lankford et al., 2008;
Franssen et al., 2009). The present review is divided into two main
parts that refer to the in vitro and in vivo properties of glial cells. Since
in vitro approaches generally have the inherent advantage of a
reduced complexity that facilitates a comparative analysis, the main
emphasis is on the in vitro behaviour of OECs and SCs from different
species, including rats and mice. Special attention was given to the
responsiveness to growth factors, in vitro proliferation and differen-
tiation together with the susceptibility of the cells to immortalization
following sustained mitogen stimulation (Table 1). These criteria
were defined, at least in part, on the basis of availability of
experimental evidence. Due to space limitations and the fact that in
vivo properties of rodent OECs and SCs have already been reviewed
previously, the analysis of the in vivo effects is restricted to OECs and
SCs from large infrahuman animals and humans (Tables 2, 3).In vitro proliferation and mitogens for OECs and SCs from

(Table 1) is complicated for several reasons. First, so far the number of
published studies in large animals and humans is very low. Although
the genetic diversity of large animals and humans asks for an
increased number of experiments compared to the rodent system,
the opposite is in fact the case. Second, the criteria used in the present
review have not been addressed systematically for OECs and SCs.
Based on the assumption that human cells will behave similarly to
their rodent counterpart, many investigators transferred cell culture
protocols established in rodents to large animals directly (Hanemann
et al., 1998; Barnett et al., 2000; Imaizumi et al., 2000; Kato et al.,
2000) without testing the relevance of single culture parameters
separately.
One consistent parameter across all studies is the responsive-
ness of OECs and SCs to typical Schwann cell mitogens (Table 1).
These factors including neuregulins and fibroblast growth factor-2
were originally identified during the isolation of neonatal rodent
SCs (Raff et al., 1978; Lemke and Brockes, 1984) and have been
subsequently shown to stimulate proliferation of rodent, canine,
porcine, primate, and human OECs (Table 1; Chuah and Teague,
1999; Wewetzer et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2001, Krudewig et al., 2006;
Techangamsuwan et al., 2008, 2009; Rubio et al., 2008; Barnett
et al., 2000) in addition to SCs (Table 1; Lemke and Brockes, 1984;
Porter et al., 1986; Davis and Stroobant, 1990; Schubert, 1992;
Rutkowski et al., 1995; Avellana-Adalid et al., 1998; Pauls et al.,
2004; Monje et al., 2006; Techangamsuwan et al., 2008, 2009)
independent of the developmental stage of the used cells. Although
adult cells generally display lower proliferation rates than early
postnatal cells, the response is apparently the same at any postnatal
age. Bianco et al. (2004) reported mitogenic effects of neurotro-
phin-3 (NT-3) on human OECs. Further studies are needed to
rod
83K. Wewetzer et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 80–87demonstrate whether this neurotrophin has the same effects on SCs
and whether this applies to cells from other species. Summarized,
there is no evidence that the so far used growth factors affect OECs
and SCs from various species differently.
The observation that OECs and SCs from different species
proliferate in response to the same mitogens does not provide
information about proliferation in the absence of exogenous factors. It
is well established that neonatal and adult rodent OECs (Pollock et al.,
1999; Alexander et al., 2002; Wewetzer et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2001)
and SCs (Raff et al., 1978; Wood and Bunge, 1975; Davis and
Stroobant, 1990) are mitogenically quiescent after isolation and
require the presence of growth factors or neurons for cellular
proliferation. Although this important cellular capacity has not
directly been addressed and is not readily apparent from the reports
published so far, there is growing evidence that large animal and
human OECs and SCs behave differently. Recently, Rubio et al. (2008)
demonstrated that rodent but not primate OECs enter a senescent
state rapidly in vitro. Previously, we reported similar properties for
canine OECs. Even under serum-free culture conditions, canine OECs
and SCs proliferated over many passages (Techangamsuwan et al.,
Table 3
Transplantation of large animal (monkey) and human Schwann cells (SCs) into either
transplantation of SCs. * = studies that tested OECs and Schwann cells in parallel.2008). Interestingly, no differences were found between canine OECs
and SCs (Techangamsuwan et al., 2008). The idea that proliferation in
OECs and SCs is controlled by similar mechanisms is also underscored
by the recent unexpected finding that transfection at early passage
with human TERT significantly reduced proliferation in both cell types
to the same extent (Techangamsuwan et al., 2009). Proliferation of
porcine OECs also does not require addition of growth factors (Radtke
et al., 2004) and cells can be grown for a limited time in vitro in the
absence of mitogen stimulation (Radtke et al., 2010b). Whether
human OECs or SCs share the capacity of autonomous growth in vitro
with primate and canine glia is not clear. Since many studies focused
on the effects of growth factors and investigated proliferation in the
absence of growth factors, the data can be only indirectly discerned
from the reports. Such an analysis, however, demonstrates that
human OECs and SCs display a limited growth factor-independent
proliferative capacity (Moretto et al., 1984; Van den Berg et al., 1995).
Another crucial aspect for the comparative analysis is the glial cell
response to increased intracellular cAMP levels. It has been recog-
nized for some time, that proliferation of rodent SCs and OECs is
stimulated by agents increasing the intracellular cAMP level, e.g.
forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP, cholera toxin (Raff et al., 1978; Sobue et al.,
1986; Davis and Stroobant, 1990; Chen et al., 1991; Stewart et al.,
1991; Jessen et al., 1991). The majority of the studies agree that theseagents under serum-containing culture conditions are sufficient to
drive proliferation, while absence of serum requires the addition of
growth factors. In the presence of serum pharmacologically induced
elevations in intracellular cAMP results in synergistic effects on
proliferation, which is paralleled by a transition in the morphology
from a spindle-shaped to a more flattened phenotype (Jessen et al.,
1991; Morgan et al., 1991). The cells then display a fenestrated
cytoplasm and are difficult to differentiate from fibroblast-like cells
under phase contrast optics. The same has been shown for rodent
OECs (Wewetzer et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2001).
When it comes to human and large animal glia, the picture is not as
clear. This is due, as outlined above, to the close orientation of human
studies on the rodent model, resulting in routine applications of a
forskolin/growth factor mixtures rather than an independent analysis
of the forskolin effect alone (Imaizumi et al., 2000, Smith et al., 2002;
Kato et al., 2000). The majority of studies reported that forskolin
potentiated the effects of growth factors in human glia but had no
effects when applied alone (Levi et al., 1995; Rutkowski et al., 1995;
Casella et al., 2000; Monje et al., 2006). This is underscored by findings
of Avellana-Adalid et al. (1998) in the monkey, where forskolin
ent or large animals/humans. Shaded in grey are studies that used autologousstimulates proliferation of SCs only in combination with growth
factors. Forskolin in human SCs was shown to increase neuregulin
receptors without increasing receptor mRNA in a density-dependent
manner (Casella et al., 2000; Fregien et al., 2004). However, other in
vitro studies failed to detect any effects of forskolin on human OEC and
SC proliferation, even when applied in combination with other
growth factors (Morrissey et al., 1995; Barnett et al., 2000).
Analysis of the morphological phenotype of forskolin-treated
human glia, although not explicitly addressed in these studies, clearly
reveals that human SCs do not alter their morphological phenotype in
response to forskolin (Levi et al., 1995; Hanemann et al., 1998). This is
in striking contrast to the rodentmodel. Interestingly, both canine and
porcine OECs and SCs treated with forskolin neither increased
proliferation nor altered their morphology as observed in rats
(Krudewig et al., 2006; Techangamsuwan et al., 2008; 2009). Since
forskolin effectively stimulates intracellular cAMP level in a variety of
different canine cell types (Luo et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2000; Chu
et al., 2004), it has to be concluded that the intracellular signalling
pathways downstream to this event are different between rodent and
humans, and, that canine cells are closely related to human cells.
Whether there is a significant difference in cAMP signalling
between OECs and SCs in large animals or humans remains
undetermined due to the low number of studies focusing on the effect
84 K. Wewetzer et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 80–87of forskolin in humans and primates. This hinders the critical
comparison between both cell types. At present, there is no indication
that OECs behave differently from SCs. With regard to the canine
system, direct comparison between OECs and SCs from the same
species did not reveal any significant differences (Techangamsuwan
et al., 2008; 2009). Taken together it can be concluded from these data,
that large animal and human OECs and SCs do not display the same
complex response to increased intracellular cAMP glia as observed in
rodent glia. In this respect, the canine system may be a relevant
translational model (Krudewig et al., 2006; Techangamsuwan et al.,
2008).
Growth, differentiation, and immortalization of OECs and SCs
from different species in long-term culture
The question how cellular proliferation is controlled is not only
relevant for the expansion of cells for transplantation purposes but
also for estimating the risk of immortalization and tumor formation
following mitogen stimulation and implantation into the nervous
system (Langford et al., 1988; Emery et al., 1999). What is also
important is the antigenic expression because a differential regener-
ative capacity of a specific cell type is only conceivable within a
distinct gene expression profile. Although several groups carried out
systematic molecular studies (Vincent et al., 2005; Boyd et al., 2006;
Franssen et al., 2008), the number of differentially expressed
candidate genes is still low. Only a limited number of studies have
focused on the behaviour of OECs and SCs in long-term culture and the
question of whether these cells have the potential to undergo
immortalization. However, the comparative analysis of this question
is of particular relevance and reveals significant differences between
the species that may be relevant to cell transplantation. As described
above, rodent glia does not proliferate in the absence of growth
factors. It is well known that sustained mitogen stimulation either by
forskolin alone or in combination with growth factors is sufficient to
induce immortalization in rodent OECs (Sonigra et al., 1996) and SCs
(Porter et al., 1987; Eccleston et al., 1991; Goda et al., 1991; Bolin et al.,
1992; Watabe et al., 1995; Shen et al., 2002; Saravanan et al., 2007).
Thus, there seems to be a reciprocal relation between autonomous
growth in vitro and the susceptibility to immortalization.
Long-term studies have been carried out with primate OECs (Rubio
et al., 2008) and canine SCs and OECs (Krudewig et al., 2006;
Techangamsuwan et al., 2008; 2009). Cells could be easily maintained
over many passages but immortalization was not observed. Similarly,
long-term in vitro studies in humans lacked features of immortaliza-
tion (Moretto et al., 1984; van den Berg et al., 1995; Rubio et al., 2008).
How porcine glia fits into this categorization is not yet clear. Recently,
we noted that the proliferation rate of porcine OECs declines during a
six week culture interval (Radtke et al., 2010b). As outlined below,
this reduced proliferative capacity correlated with a reduced
remyelinating potential following transplantion into the demyeli-
nated spinal cord (Radtke et al., 2010b).
Although there have been several molecular studies on the specific
gene expression of rodent OECs and SCs (Vincent et al., 2005; Boyd
et al., 2006; Franssen et al., 2008), there are only a few data available
on putative differences in the expression between species. Although
expression of classical cell type-specific markers, such as the
neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR), seems to be well conserved
across the species, differences with respect to the time course of
expression have been reported recently. Parallel to differences in the
proliferation there is distinct regulation of p75NTR expression in
rodent and porcine and primate OECs (Rubio et al., 2008). While
primate OECs display stable expression of p75NTR in vitro (Rubio et al.,
2008) both rodent and porcine OECs display down-regulation in vitro
during long-term cultivation (Rubio et al., 2008; Radtke et al., 2004,
2010b) OECs and SCs from adult dogs have been shown to behave
similar to primate cells (Krudewig et al., 2006; Techangamsuwanet al., 2008, 2009) and expression of p75NTR is maintained throughout
multiple passages.
Taken together, it is concluded that significant species-specific
differences exist regarding proliferation and that canine OECs and to a
lesser extent porcine OECs and SCs share a number of characteristics
with human cells. These data suggest that canine, primate and human
but not rodent and porcine OECs and SCs can easily maintained in
long-term culture. Contrary to rodent cells, however, there is no
immortalization of the cells. This indicates subtle differences in the
growth control of glia between the different species. Mitogen
stimulation can be ruled out as the only critical parameter, since
canine glia does not immortalize even under sustained mitogen
stimulation. The sustained proliferative capacity of canine, primate
and human OECs and SCs is associated with the stable expression of
p75NTR (Rubio et al., 2008; Techangamsuwan et al., 2008; 2009).
Again, this seems to be in contrast with the rodent system. As shown
by Rubio et al. (2008) rodent but not primate OECs displayed down-
regulation of the neurotrophin receptor in long-term culture.
Transplantation and in vivo effects OECs and SCs from
different species
Although there is a huge number of in vivo studies demonstrating
that OECs and SCs promote axonal regrowth and remyelination
(Wewetzer et al., 2002; Santos-Benito and Ramón-Cueto, 2003), the
specific regenerative potential of both cell types even in the rodent
model is still not clearly defined (Radtke andWewetzer, 2009). The in
vivo paradigms used to define the in vivo effects of OECs in the rat
originally included dorsal horn rhizotomy, corticospinal tract or spinal
cord transection in addition to ethidium bromide-induced demyelin-
ation (Ramón-Cueto and Nieto-Sampedro, 1994; Li et al., 1997;
Navarro et al., 1999; Kato et al. 2000). While the capacity of OECs to
promote axonal ingrowth into the CNS after rhizotomy has been
questioned recently (Goméz et al., 2003; Ramer et al., 2004; Riddell
et al., 2004), there is also a controversy about the myelinogenic
potential of transplanted OECs (Harvey and Plant, 2006; Wewetzer
and Brandes, 2006). Due to the lack of cell type-specific markers for
OECs and SCs, it cannot be excluded presently that presence of
peripheral type myelin after transplantation of OECs is at least in part
due to SCs contaminating the OEC transplants. Classical studies in the
rodent model focused on axonal regeneration in the spinal cord and
reported that OECs and SCs increased long distance axonal growth
and axonal sprouting at the lesion site, respectively (Li and Raisman,
1994; Li et al., 1997; Ramón-Cueto et al., 2000; Imaizumi et al., 2000).
Due to the lack of comparable approaches testing both cell types in
parallel in the same model, the relevance of this effect remains to be
confirmed (Wewetzer et al., 2002).
The discussion of these data aims to provide a historical
background rather than to concentrate on discrepancies to the rodent
model. The relevant questions within the scope of the present review
are whether OECs and SCs from large animals display similar or
distinct in vivo effects compared rodent glia, and, mechanistically and
easier to answer, which experimental models have been chosen to
demonstrate the in vivo capacity of large animal and human OECs. To
allow a focussed interpretation, only studies that used large animal
and human glia for grafting were included in the present analysis. The
fact that OECs (Table 2; Barnett et al., 2000; Imaizumi et al., 2000; Kato
et al., 2000, Smith et al., 2002; Deng et al., 2006; Shyu et al., 2008)
were more frequently used for transplantation than SCs (Table 3;
Avellana-Adalid et al., 1998; Imaizumi et al., 2000; Kohama et al.,
2001; Girard et al., 2005; Bachelin et al., 2010) most likely reflects the
idea that the regenerative potential of these cells is superior to that of
SCs. Surprisingly, the vast majority of in vivo studies with OECs and
SCs and rodent recipients (Tables 2, 3, white) used chemically induced
demyelination as experimental approach (e.g. Bachelin et al., 2005;
Girard et al., 2005; Kohama et al., 2001) instead of spinal cord
199–207.

This indicates that the classical injury models that mainly defined the
regenerative capacity of rodent OECs were only rarely used for large
animal and human OECs. One of the few studies that critically
compared the effects of rat and human OECs after implantation into
the intact and lesioned rat spinal cord was carried out by Deng et al.
(2006). However, since the authors mainly concentrated on the
survival and migration of the grafted cells, this study does not
provide any clue to answer the question whether large animal as
well as human OECs and SCs possess the same regenerative potential
as rodent cells. Guest et al. (2008) who used spinal cord transection
and transplantation of human OECs failed to detect long tract
corticospinal tract regeneration, while Calancie et al. (2009)
reported on axonal regeneration after transplantation of human
SCs into mice. It also becomes evident that the majority of studies
demonstrated increased remyelination by OECs from large animals
in comparison to vehicle controls morphologically while functional
analyses were often included only in studies using SCs (Imaizumi et
al., 2000; Kohama et al., 2001; Girard et al., 2005). This observation
further underscores the need to analyze effects of the transplanted
glial cells in the same experimental paradigm (Wewetzer et al.,
2002; Radtke and Wewetzer, 2009).
It can be concluded that transplantation of large animal and
human OECs in the rodent model apparently increased the formation
of morphologically detectable myelin. Whether this correlates with a
functional improvement or one of the two cell types displays a
superior regenerative potential remains unclear at present. What also
remains to be established is whether human and rodent OECs and SCs
differ in their in vivo actions from each other. The result of the present
analysis is sobering since the regenerative potential of large animal
and human OECs and SCs is still poorly defined. In this respect, the
autologous transplantation studies do not provide more information
(Tables 2, 3). Since themain emphasis of these studies is the detection
of putative adverse effects, which were either not (Saberi et al., 2008)
or only rarely observed (Lima et al., 2006), no conclusions regarding
the regenerative potential of the implanted cells can be drawn. The
question is whether large animal models may provide valuable
information of the in vivo effects and help to improve human
procedures. Jeffery et al. (2005) reported that autologous transplan-
tation of canine OECs is reliable and safe in naturally occurring spinal
cord lesion models. It is the hope that such studies in translational
models will speed up the transfer of experimental data to clinical
practice (Jeffery et al., 2006).
Conclusions
In the present review a comprehensive in vitro and in vivo analysis
of OEC and SC properties based on own and published experiments
was performed. The presented evidence clearly reveals the existence
of species-specific properties of growth-promoting glia. Based on the
in vitro analysis of cellular proliferation, we conclude that human and
rodent glia display significant differences in the control of cellular
proliferation and that glia from large animals, e.g. dogs, pigs and
monkeys more closely resemble their human counterpart. Moreover,
the summarized data are also evidence for a close relationship
between OECs and SCs. There were no significant differences between
both cell types that became evident during this analysis.
However, whether the observed differences are relevant for the in
vivo application of the cells is not apparent from the currently
available data. The in vivo effects of OECs and SCs from large animals
and humans are still poorly defined. Moreover, due to the low number
of comparative studies between OECs and SCs and between glia from
different species, it remains to be determined whether OECs from
humans share the same regenerative effects as detected in the rodent
system. It is recommended to cross the bridge between humans and
rodents by intensifying the work with translational models thatSurvival and migration of human and rat olfactory ensheathing cells in intact and
