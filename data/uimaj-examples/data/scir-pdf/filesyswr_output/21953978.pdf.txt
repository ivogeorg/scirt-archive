Abstract: Modifications of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
(PHEMA) with cholesterol and the introduction of large pores
have been developed to create highly superporous hydrogels
that promote cell–surface interactions and that can serve as a
permissive scaffold for spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment.
Highly superporous cholesterol-modified PHEMA scaffolds
have been prepared by the bulk radical copolymerization of
2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), cholesterol methacry-
late (CHLMA), and ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) cross-
linking agent in the presence of ammonium oxalate crystals
to establish interconnected pores in the scaffold. Moreover,
2-[(methoxycarbonyl)methoxy]ethyl methacrylate (MCMEMA)
was incorporated in the polymerization recipe and hydro-
lyzed, thus introducing carboxyl groups in the hydrogel to
control its swelling and softness. The hydrogels supported
the in vitro adhesion and proliferation of rat mesenchymal
stem cells. In an in vivo study of acute rat SCI, hydrogels
were implanted to bridge a hemisection cavity. Histological
evaluation was done 4 weeks after implantation and revealed
the good incorporation of the implanted hydrogels into the
surrounding tissue, the progressive infiltration of connective
tissue and the ingrowth of neurofilaments, Schwann cells,
and blood vessels into the hydrogel pores. The results show
that highly superporous cholesterol-modified PHEMA hydro-
gels have bioadhesive properties and are able to bridge a spi-
nal cord lesion. VC 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

INTRODUCTION
Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in permanent neurolog-
ical deficits as a consequence of the inability of axons to
regenerate across the lesion. Although the adult spinal cord
is currently known to be capable of functional reorganiza-
tion and axonal sprouting and, similarly as other regions of
the adult central nervous system (CNS), the adult spinal
cord contains neural stem and progenitor cells,1 the inhibi-
tory environment of the mature mammalian CNS, the glial
scar barrier as well as cyst formation hinder neurons from
regenerating across the site of injury.2 Cell transplantation
has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for SCI.3,4
However, in the case of a large spinal cord lesion, when the
cystic cavity is developed, cell transplantation alone is not
sufficient for tissue regeneration, and tissue repair requires
‘‘bridging’’ the lesion with a 3D permissive environment that
can fill the tissue gap and concomitantly support axonal re-
growth and the re-establishment of damaged connections.5
To develop appropriate materials, much of the current
research is focused on both naturally derived and synthetic
hydrogels due to their softness and flexibility,5,6 but also
other materials, such as sponges, self-assembling nanofibers,
tubes, and fibers, have been studied.7–12 Hydrogels are cross-
linked hydrophilic polymers that swell in water, which can
make their mechanical properties similar to those of the
nervous tissue and concomitantly enable ion and metabolite
exchange with tissue fluids. Naturally derived hydrogels com-
prising collagen,13 alginates,14 hyaluronic acid,15,16 agarose,17

or fibrin18 have been reported to be promising scaffolding
materials for the treatment of SCI as they are nontoxic,
biocompatible, and mostly biodegradable.19 The synthetic
hydrogels used for spinal cord implantation include
poly(ethylene glycol),20 poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
(PHEMA),21–23 or poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide]
(PHPMA).22,24
For neural repair, hydrogels are additionally being
designed for cell transfer12,25 or as carriers for the sus-
tained local delivery of chondroitinase,26 neurotrophic fac-
tors,27 or other drugs and bioactive substances.28
PHEMA has been widely used as a biomaterial due to its
good biocompatibility and the possibility to tailor its physi-
cal and chemical properties.29 Since PHEMA does not have
cell-adhesive properties, additional modification of this poly-
mer is needed to promote cell–surface interactions. To
improve the bioactivity of PHEMA scaffolds, the introduction
of groups with positive charges30 or modification with lami-
nin-derived peptides have been previously employed.31,32 In
a previous report, we have demonstrated that cholesterol-
modified superporous PHEMA scaffolds (with a pore size
from 101 to 102 lm) display significantly improved bioadhe-
sive properties and support cell adhesion and prolifera-
tion.33 However, the elastic modulus of these scaffolds,
 130 kPa, was much higher than the elastic modulus
determined for neuronal tissue,  1–4 kPa,34,35 and there-
fore not suitable for application in neural tissue engineering,
especially for spinal cord treatment. In the present study,
we aimed to increase the swellability and softness of choles-
terol-modified PHEMA hydrogels and to design highly
superporous scaffolds possessing good mechanical proper-
ties that could be utilized as implants in the soft spinal cord
tissue. In contrast to superporous scaffolds with  45%
inorganic porogen loading, highly superporous hydrogels
possess more porogen, amounting to 60–65% of the entire
hydrogel volume. Novel cholesterol-modified superporous
PHEMA scaffolds have been prepared by the bulk radical
copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA),
cholesterol methacrylate (CHLMA), and the crosslinking
agent ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) in the presence of
ammonium oxalate crystals to introduce interconnected
superpores in the matrix. To increase swellability, an addi-
tional monomer, 2-[(methoxycarbonyl)methoxy]ethyl meth-
acrylate (MCMEMA), was incorporated in the polymerization
recipe and hydrolyzed to [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethoxy]acetic
acid (MOEAA), thus introducing carboxyl groups in the poly-
mer. Three types of PHEMA hydrogels containing 2 wt %, 4
wt %, and 8 wt % of MOEAA were prepared, differing both
in swelling and charge.
To evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility of the hydro-
gels, cell adhesion and proliferation were studied using mes-
enchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have been increasingly
used in cell therapy and tissue engineering, due to their re-
generative potential and capacity to differentiate into vari-
ous cell types after implantation into injured tissue.36 More-
over, it has been shown recently that PHPMA hydrogels
seeded with MSCs and implanted into a chronic spinal cord
lesion prevented tissue atrophy and improved behavioral
outcome.37 To determine their ability to bridge a spinal
cord lesion, the hydrogels were implanted into an acute
model of SCI in rats (hemisection), and their regenerative
potential was histologically evaluated 4 weeks after
implantation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
HEMA (Röhm, Germany) and EDMA (Ugilor S.A., France)
were distilled under reduced pressure. MCMEMA and
CHLMA were synthesized according to a previously pub-
lished procedure.33 2,20-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was
obtained from Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland. Ammonium oxalate
(Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic) was crystallized from
water under the formation of 30–90 lm thick and about
0.3–10 mm long needle-like crystals and used as a porogen.
All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Adrich (St.
Luis, MO).
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and fetal
bovine serum (FBS), purchased from PAA Laboratories
(Pasching, Austria), and PrimocinTM purchased from Lonza
(Cologne, Germany) were used for cell cultivation. The WST-
1 assay was purchased from Roche (Mannheim, Germany).
Ampicilin, atropine, and mesocain were purchased from BB
Pharma (Prague, Czech Republic). For immunofluorescent
staining, Chemiblocker, Triton X-100, bovine serum albumin
(BSA), mouse anti-vinculin, Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-
GFAP, mouse anti-NF 160 and mouse anti-NF 200 purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, rabbit anti-NGF Receptor p75 pur-
chased from Millipore (Temecula, CA), mouse anti-RECA-1
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), Alexa-Fluor 568
phalloidin, 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and goat
anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa-Fluor 488 or Alexa-
Fluor 594, purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK), were used.
Preparation of superporous P(HEMA-CHLMA) hydrogel
implants
In a typical experiment, a 5 mL polyethylene syringe
equipped with a stainless 32-lm mesh was loaded in a
dust-free box with a suspension of freshly crystallized am-
monium oxalate (2.55 g; 42.3 vol %) in water. The excess
solution was removed by centrifugation, and the crystals
washed with ethanol and dried at room temperature. The
hot (90C) saturated solution (3 mL) of ammonium oxalate
was again loaded and additional crystals were precipitated
after cooling. This procedure was repeated three times. The
monomer mixture, including HEMA (2.375 or 2.225 g),
MCMEMA (50 or 200 mg; 2 or 8 wt %), CHLMA (50 mg; 2
wt %), EDMA (25 mg; 1 wt %), AIBN (10 mg), and 1,4-diox-
ane (1.25 mL), was then added and the syringe sealed. The
mixture was polymerized at 60C for 16 h; the syringe was
then cut lengthwise and the hydrogel cylinder removed. The
resulting superporous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-
2-[(methoxycarbonyl)methoxy]ethyl methacrylate-co-choles-
terol methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) [P(HEMA-
MCMEMA-CHLMA-EDMA), in the text further abbreviated as
P(HEMA-CHLMA)], cylinder was incubated at room

temperature first in a saturated solution of NaCl for 24 h
(to avoid cracks) and then in 300 mL of 0.025M H2SO4 for
24 h to hydrolyze the MCMEMA moiety, yielding MOEAA.
This was followed by repeated washing with water (200 mL
each time) for 4 days, treatment at 23C with 300 mL of
0.05M NaOH for 6 h, and finally by washing with water
until a neutral pH was reached.
Analogously, the P(HEMA-MCMEMA-CHLMA-EDMA) cyl-
inder was washed in a saturated solution of NaCl and water
for 4 h, followed by washing with 5% ammonium hydroxide
solution at 45C for 16 h to transform MCMEMA into 2-(2-
amino-2-oxoethoxy)ethyl methacrylate (AOEEMA) (Scheme
1). Finally, the cylinder was washed with water, 0.05M HCl,
and water. For the cell culture experiments, cylinders were
cut into 0.7-mm thick discs using an HM650V Vibroslicer
(Microm, Walldorf, Germany), washed with water, 0.025M
H2SO4, 0.1M NaOH, and water, and finally sterilized in an
autoclave for 30 min at 120C.
Hydrogel characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired
using a JSM 6400 (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) scanning electron
microscope. The samples were sputter-coated with 4 nm of
Pt before imaging. Fluorescent images were acquired by a
LSM DUO5 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena,
Germany).
Swelling (Sw) and water regain in pores (P) were esti-
mated by weighing water-soaked PHEMA cylinders before
(mw) and after centrifugation (mc) (800g). Hydrogels were
swollen in water for at least 16 h. Water regain in pores
was determined as P ¼ (mw  mc)/mc (g/g). Swelling was
defined as Sw ¼ (mc – mo)/mo (g/g), where mo is the weight
of the dried polymer.
Mechanical testing
The stiffness of highly superporous P(HEMA-2%MOEAA-
CHLMA), P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA), and P(HEMA-
4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-CHLMA) samples was assessed by
compressive testing. Cylindrical specimens having an h/D
(height-to-diameter) ratio equal to 1 were exposed to a
compressive load using an Instron 5800R (Norwood, MA)
universal tester. The diameter of the cylinders was approxi-
mately 12.5 mm. The tests were performed at a constant
speed of 0.5 mm/min at ambient temperature. During the
test the cylinders were immersed in a phosphate buffer.
From the initial straight-line portion of the stress–strain dia-
gram, a modulus of elasticity was calculated by dividing the
change in stress r2 – r1 by the corresponding change in
strain e2 ¼ 0.10 minus e1 ¼ 0.05. Assessment of the modu-
lus is schematically depicted in Figure 1.
Cell culture
MSCs were isolated from 4-week-old Wistar rats. The bone
marrow was extruded from the femurs using a needle and a
syringe with MSC culture medium containing DMEM with
10% FBS and PrimocinTM (100 lg/mL). After 24 h, the non-
adherent cells were removed by replacing the medium. Cul-
tures were kept in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at
37C; cells up to the third passage were used for seeding
hydrogel discs. Sterile hydrogel discs were placed into a 24-
well plate with MSC culture medium, seeded with a suspen-
sion of 40,000 cells per disc and incubated for 1–5 days.
Cell viability was determined by the WST-1 assay based on
the spectrophotometric quantification of the water-soluble
formazan dye. One, three and five days after seeding, the
discs were washed with culture medium and placed into a
new well with 0.5 mL culture medium. Fifty microliters of
the WST-1 reagent were added to each disc, and the discs
were incubated for 3 h at 37C to form formazan. Two hun-
dred microliters of formazan-containing medium were then
transferred from each well to a 96-well plate. The absorb-
ance was measured using a Tecan Spectra ELISA plate
reader (Tecan Trading, Männedorf, Switzerland) at a wave-
length of 450 nm.
The morphology of the cells grown on the hydrogels
was examined by immunofluorescent staining for actin fila-
ments and vinculin. After fixation in paraformaldehyde in
PBS for 15 min, the cells were washed with 0.1M PBS and

treated with Chemiblocker (1:20) and Triton X-100 (0.5%)
in PBS. MSCs were incubated with Alexa-Fluor 568 phalloi-
din (1:300) and with an antibody directed against vinculin
(1:200) diluted in 0.1M PBS containing 1% BSA and Triton
X-100 (0.5 wt % solution). This was followed by incubation
with a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated
with Alexa-Fluor 488 (1:200) diluted in 0.1M PBS contain-
ing Triton X-100 (0.5 wt %). After washing with PBS, the
nuclei were visualized by using 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-
dole (DAPI) fluorescent dye.
Hydrogel implantation
Twelve male rats (Wistar, Velaz, Czech Republic) with a
weight of 250–300 g underwent a hemisection at the level of
the 8th thoracic vertebra (Th8). The animals were intraperi-
toneally injected with pentobarbital for anesthesia (solution
of 1 g/100 mL, 6 mL/kg of animal weight); one dose of ATB
(ampicilin 0.3 mL s.c.), atropine (0.2 mL s.c., 1:5), and meso-
cain to enhance local anesthesia (0.3 mL s.c. and i.m.) was
administered preoperatively. A linear skin incision was per-
formed above the spinous processes of Th7–9; the paraverte-
bral muscles were detached from the laminae Th7–9, and a
Th8 laminectomy was performed. The dura was incised, and
about 2 mm  2 mm  2 mm of spinal cord tissue was
dissected to form a hemisection cavity on the right side of
the spinal cord. The animals were divided into three groups
and P(HEMA-2%MOEAA-CHLMA), P(HEMA-4%MOEAA-4%-
AOEEMA-CHLMA), or P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA) sterile
hydrogels were properly trimmed to adjust to the size and
shape of the cavity. The hydrogel was implanted in such a
way as to ensure that it would firmly adhere to the edges of
the hemisection cavity without causing any undue pressure
on the surrounding spinal cord tissue. The dura mater was
sutured with a 10/0 monofil unresorbable thread (B Braun,
Aesculap, Melsungen, Germany). The muscles and skin were
sutured with a 4/0 monofil unresorbable thread (4/0 Chir-
max, Prague, Czech Republic), and the animals were housed
two in a cage with food and water ad libitum. The study was
performed in accordance with the European Communities
Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC)
regarding the use of animals in research and was approved
by the Central Commission for Animal Protection of the Acad-
emy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in Prague.
Tissue processing and histology
Four weeks after the hydrogel implantation, the animals
were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of overdose pentobarbital and perfused with physiological
saline followed by 4% paraformaldahyde in 0.1M phosphate
buffer. The spinal cord was left in bone overnight, then
removed and postfixed in the same fixative for at least 1
week. A 3-cm long segment of the spinal cord containing
the lesioned site was dissected out, and a series of 40 lm
thick longitudinal sections was collected. Hematoxylin–eosin
(H&E) staining was performed using a standard protocol.
For immunohistological testing, antibodies directed against
the following markers were used: GFAP (1:200) to identify
astrocytes, NF 160 and NF 200 (1:200) to identify neurofila-
ments, p75 (1:100) to identify Schwann cells, and RECA-1
(1:50) to identify endothelial cells of blood vessels. Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) and Alexa
Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) were
used as secondary antibodies. The nuclei were visualized by
using 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescent dye.
Quantification of the neurofilament infiltration into the
hydrogel
Longitudinal histological sections were collected, and every
fifth section from each type of implanted hydrogel was im-
munostained for NF 160. The sections were examined with
a fluorescent camera (Zeiss) and photographed using Axi-
oVs40V Axiovision software (Zeiss). The area of neurofila-
ments (NF) that infiltrated the hydrogel was delineated in
each section, and the area of NF infiltration was calculated
as (area of NF/area of hydrogel in the section)  100.
Statistical analysis
The values were calculated as mean 6 standard deviations.
Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were deter-
mined using a one-way ANOVA test.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fabrication of highly superporous cholesterol-modified
PHEMA scaffolds
Cellular adhesion to implants is important as it mediates
many aspects of biocompatibility. The modification of
PHEMA hydrogels with a functional group is necessary for
in vitro cellular adhesion as well as for in vivo tissue infil-
tration when a hydrogel is implanted into neuronal tissue.
Surface charge is considered to be one of the factors influ-
encing tissue ingrowth into an implanted hydrogel.30,38,39 To
facilitate cell adhesion on a polymer matrix, cholesterol-
modified PHEMA hydrogels (2 wt % CHLMA) were designed
and proved to be successful for tissue engineering applica-
tions.33 The polymer matrix, however, has to contain reac-
tive functional groups if immobilization of biomolecules is
required. Therefore, an additional monomer, MCMEMA, was
incorporated in the polymerization recipe, which was hydro-
lyzed to MOEAA after the completion of polymerization,
thus introducing carboxyl groups in the polymer (Scheme
1) to control swellability and softness and to facilitate the
subsequent attachment of adhesive peptides, antibodies, or
other biomolecules. Moreover, EDMA (1 wt %) was also
used as a crosslinking agent comonomer, thus hindering the
dissolution of the resulting material in biological fluids. The
presence of CHLMA in the PHEMA hydrogel is then impor-
tant to improve the cell adhesion.33
To repair an SCI by implanting a polymer scaffold, it is
important that the implant’s porosity and softness are com-
parable to those of the nervous tissue. If the hydrogel is too
stiff, the mismatch in mechanical properties between the
native tissue of the soft spinal cord and the implant may
result in the failure of the implant. Moreover, cysts between
the implant and the surrounding spinal cord tissue might be
formed after implantation (Supporting Information Fig. 1).
The porosity (macro-, micro-, and nanopores) of the
hydrogel scaffold plays an important role in enabling cell
attachment and migration, as well as the diffusion of
nutrients. Moreover, the substrate’s elasticity has been
shown to regulate the differentiation of MSCs into a neuro-
nal phenotype34 as well as neurite outgrowth.40
To increase the pore volume, the syringe used as a mold
for the fabrication of the P(HEMA-CHLMA) scaffolds was
repeatedly (three times) charged with ammonium oxalate
crystals. The procedure used for the preparation of the scaf-
fold, namely the repeated addition of a hot saturated ammo-
nium oxalate solution to previously introduced crystals, has
been described in the Experimental section. Three highly
superporous scaffolds were designed: (i) P(HEMA-
2%MOEAA-CHLMA), (ii) P(HEMA-4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-
CHLMA), and (iii) P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA). As a result
of repeated ammonium oxalate loading, the content of the
crystals in the hydrogel increased to 65 vol %. The crystals
in the polymer matrix maintained their diameter and length
up to several millimeters. After washing-out of the salt, 30–
100 lm pores were then imprinted in the conventional
superporous PHEMA matrices (Fig. 2). Such pore size is de-
sirable for the ingrowth of cells into the scaffold matrix.
More pores with thinner walls were seen in highly
superporous P(HEMA-2%MOEAA-CHLMA) hydrogel [Fig.
1(B)], in which faster diffusion of low-molecular-weight
compounds can be expected, than in conventional superpo-
rous P(HEMA-2%MOEAA-CHLMA) hydrogel filled with a
porogen only once [Fig. 1(A)].
To increase the hydrophilicity, highly superporous
P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA) hydrogel was prepared with a
fourfold greater amount of MOEAA moiety than in the
P(HEMA-2%MOEAA-CHLMA) scaffold. As a consequence, the
former hydrogel swelled in water about 2.7 times more com-
pared with the latter one (Table I). Superporous P(HEMA-
MOEAA-CHLMA) hydrogels (typical Sw > 1 g water/g dry
polymer) swelled more than neat PHEMA, which contained
only 0.38 g water/g of dry hydrogel. In order that the hydro-
philic scaffolds were not only highly swellable, but at the
same time also contained a limited amount of acids
(MOEAA), which could be a limiting factor in biological tests
(acid possibly irritating the tissue), highly superporous
P(HEMA-8%MCMEMA-CHLMA) hydrogel was modified by a
reaction with ammonium hydroxide. This resulted in about

50% ammonolysis of MCMEMA to 2-(2-amino-2-oxoethoxy)-
ethyl methacrylate (AOEEMA) as confirmed by nitrogen
analysis (Table I). The advantage of highly superporous
P(HEMA-4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-CHLMA) hydrogel consists
in the fact that its swelling is not so strongly pH-dependent,
in contrast to P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA) hydrogel. So, for
example, while the volume of a highly superporous P(HEMA-
8%MOEAA-CHLMA) cylinder was 2.2 mL at pH 2, it was 4.8
mL at pH 12. In contrast, the volume of a highly superporous
P(HEMA-4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-CHLMA) cylinder was 4
mL at pH 2 and 4.6 mL at pH 12. With an increasing content
of carboxyl groups (MOEAA) in highly superporous hydro-
gels, not only their swelling in water but also their pore vol-
ume increased (Table I). However, both values decreased af-
ter partial ammonolysis, probably due to a lower content of
carboxyl groups.
Water regain in pores (P) should roughly correspond to
the content of ammonium oxalate in the polymerization
feed (Table I). The differences in the pore volume from the
amount of porogen added in the feed in highly superporous
P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA) and P(HEMA-4%MOEAA-
4%AOEEMA-CHLMA) hydrogels can be ascribed to inaccu-
rate measurements due to the difficulty of manipulating a
very soft (mechanically unstable) material (Table I). Never-
theless, highly superporous cholesterol-modified PHEMA
hydrogels had a sufficient size and pore volume to accom-
modate cells. As the pore walls were intentionally weak-
ened, the scaffolds contained a minimum amount of the
polymer, which resulted in its softness.
To correlate the compliance of the hydrogels with the
results of biomedical experiments, the modulus of elasticity of
highly superporous P(HEMA-2%MOEAA-CHLMA), P(HEMA-
4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-CHLMA), and P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-
CHLMA) cylinders was measured (Fig. 2). The results
obtained from compressive tests are summarized in Table I.
As the modulus is a measure of stiffness, which is a reciprocal
characteristic to compliance, it can be seen that the most com-
pliant is P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA). On the other hand,
P(HEMA-4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-CHLMA) is rather rigid,
exhibiting the highest modulus value, while P(HEMA-
2%MOEAA-CHLMA) has a moderate stiffness. Conventional
superporous cholesterol-modified PHEMA hydrogels
described previously41 exhibit an elastic modulus of 134.9 6
19.4 kPa. It is obvious that the moduli of highly superporous
P(HEMA-MOEAA-CHLMA) scaffolds are lower by an order of
magnitude and, therefore, that the superporous scaffolds are
much more suitable for neural tissue applications.
In vitro cell growth
Morphological observation of attached MSCs seeded on
highly superporous cholesterol-modified PHEMA hydrogels
was done after 3 days of culture using immunofluorescent
staining for F-actin and vinculin (Fig. 3). Cells attached and
spread mostly in the pores of all hydrogels and formed well
developed parallel organized microfilaments [Fig. 3(A–F)] as
well as vinculin adhesion spots [Fig. 3(D–F)]. These findings

bioadhesive role of the cholesterol modification. In our prior
work, we demonstrated that cells also attach to neat super-
porous PHEMA hydrogels, but do not spread and remain in
a spherical shape. We have also reported that serum
proteins proved to be necessary for cell spreading on the
surface of superporous cholesterol-modified PHEMA
hydrogels.33
Cell viability on the hydrogels was investigated after 1,
3, and 5 days of culture (Fig. 4) and revealed that all the
highly superporous cholesterol-modified PHEMA hydrogels
are non-cytotoxic and support cell proliferation. The fact
that no significant differences in cell viability were found
among the different types of hydrogel after 1 day suggests
that the hydrogels have similar cell adhesive properties. Sig-
nificantly higher cell viability was subsequently found for
P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA) hydrogels vs. P(HEMA-
2%MOEAA-CHLMA) (p < 0.01) as well as vs. P(HEMA-
4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-CHLMA) (p < 0.01) after 5 days.
This suggests that the higher porosity and at the same time
higher compliance (lower modulus of elasticity) of the
P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA) hydrogels might promote cell
migration, growth, and proliferation.
Histological evaluation of hydrogels implanted into SCI
Highly superporous P(HEMA-2%MOEAA-CHLMA), P(HEMA-
4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-CHLMA), and P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-
CHLMA) hydrogels were implanted into hemisected spinal
cords, and the biocompatibility and tissue ingrowth into the
hydrogels were histologically examined 4 weeks after im-
plantation. As shown previously in our experiments, this
time interval is sufficient for tissue ingrowth into an
implanted hydrogel.30
All the hydrogel implants were found to be well-inte-
grated into the surrounding tissue; they closely adhered to
the surrounding tissue and formed a bridge across the
lesion. Hematoxylin–eosin staining (Fig. 5) as well as cell
nuclei (DAPI) staining [Fig. 6(D–F)] showed that the hydro-
gel pores were entirely filled with the infiltrated cells with
no marked differences in tissue infiltration among hydrogels
containing 2, 4, or 8 wt % of MOEAA. A sparse foreign body
reaction with foamy macrophages [Fig. 5(D,F)] and giant
cell granulomas [Fig. 5(B,D,F)] was found locally around the
implanted hydrogels; nevertheless, no adverse reaction with
chronic inflammation or fibrosis was detected.
A non-specific inflammatory response with the invasion
of macrophages and the formation of multinucleated foreign
body giant cells is the reaction of biological tissue to foreign
material in the tissue, and the extent of this reaction deter-
mines the implant’s biocompatibility. Biocompatibility relies
basically on surface phenomena, represented by cell–poly-
mer and polymer–protein interactions.42 It has been
reported that the non-specific adsorption of blood and tis-
sue fluid proteins on the implant surfaces is primarily re-
sponsible for phagocyte adsorption and their reaction on
implant surfaces.43 The progression of the foreign body
reaction is regulated by soluble mediators, such as cyto-
kines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases, which
are produced locally by tissue cells and infiltrating inflam-
matory cells.44 Methacrylic polymers, such as PHEMA, are
resistant to biodegradation and thus susceptible to cell
encapsulation;42 nevertheless, PHEMA hydrogels are
reported to be well tolerated, non-toxic, and biocompatible.
A low occurrence of multinucleated foreign body giant cells
was observed on the surface of ocular implants 6 months
after implantation.45 Modest cellular inflammatory
responses that disappeared by 4 weeks postimplantation
were observed when PHEMA scaffolds were implanted into
cervical spinal cord hemisections.23 On the other hand, the
presence of a fibrous capsule and some foreign-body-type
giant cells was reported using 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-
co-methyl methacrylate)-based nerve guidance channels in
the sciatic nerve over a period of 16 weeks.46 As shown in
Figure 5(B,F), the reaction of foreign body giant cells to
superporous cholesterol-modified PHEMA hydrogels was
mainly found at the tissue–hydrogel interface, where the dif-
ference in mechanical properties between implant and tis-
sue might trigger the encapsulation of the implant. The
other reason for the foreign body reaction might be the
presence of some hydrogel debris generated during hydro-
gel shaping and delivered into the tissue during implanta-
tion. A significant foreign body reaction was found in our
previous study when PHEMA hydrogels with a positive
charge were implanted inside the hemisected spinal cord.30
Six months after hydrogel implantation, observation
revealed that the granulomatous reaction was significantly
reduced with only a minimal or no giant cell reaction, indi-
cating that this type of inflammatory response to the
implant diminished over time and did not have any negative
effect on the stability of the hydrogels. Nevertheless, for
proper determination of the hydrogels’ biocompatibility, a
longer-term and more detailed analysis of the immune reac-
tion is essential.
In all three hydrogels, NF immunostaining revealed the
ingrowth of NF-positive fibers (NF 160 and NF 200 stain-
ing) into the pores throughout the whole implant [Fig. 6(A–
C)]. The NF-positive fibers were arranged mostly in bundles
and originated from the surrounding gray or white matter
from the rostral as well as the caudal parts of the surround-
ing spinal cord and also from the spinal root entry zone.

The quantitative evaluation of the area fraction (%) of
neurofilament infiltration in the implanted hydrogels did
not show any significant differences between the hydrogels
containing 2, 4, or 8 wt % of MOEAA (Table II). All of the
NF-positive fibers were co-localized with Schwann cells
(p75 staining) that infiltrated the hydrogel implants from
the spinal root entry zone and provided axon guiding and
myelinization (Fig. 7). This is in accordance with many
other studies that have demonstrated the beneficial role of
Schwann cells for nerve regeneration in the CNS.47 However,
we cannot exclude the possibility that all of the infiltrating
axons might be of peripheral origin. More specific staining
of the CNS neuronal tracts needs to be performed to deter-
mine the true origin of the regenerating fibers.
Immunostaining against endothelial cells (RECA stain-
ing) showed a number of blood vessels that infiltrated the
pores throughout the whole hydrogel implant [Fig. 6(D–F)].
No migration of astrocytes or astrocytic process (GFAP
staining) ingrowth into the hydrogels was observed [Fig.
6(G–I)]. Similar results have also been reported in other
studies of hydrogel spinal cord implants.12,30 One month af-
ter the implantation of positively and negatively charged
PHEMA hydrogels into a spinal cord hemisection, no astro-
cytic ingrowth was found in the positively charged PHEMA
hydrogels, while astrocytes infiltrated the peripheral zone of
negatively charged or uncharged hydrogels. On the other
hand, positively charged hydrogels showed increased axonal
ingrowth into the implant.30 Conversely, the infiltration of

astrocytes into the peripheral as well as the central parts of
PHPMA-RGD hydrogels seeded with MSCs was observed 6
months after implantation, together with an ingrowth of
neuronal processes, Schwann cells, and blood vessels.37
The dependence of cell behavior on substrate stiffness
has been shown in several studies,34,40 but the optimal
and/or limiting mechanical properties of the scaffold have
not yet been defined in in vivo spinal cord experiments.
Bakshi et al. (2004) reported that a PHEMA matrix with a
compressive modulus of 3–4 kPa matched the spinal cord
tissue when implanted into a cervical hemisection.23
According to our results, the hydrogel compliance, measured
as an elastic modulus by compressive testing, ranged
between 10 and 19 kPa. Interestingly, marked differences in
the tissue response to hydrogels of such elastic modulus
were not found when the hydrogels were transplanted into
a hemisection cavity.
SCI comprises a cascade of cellular and biochemical
events that lead to the loss of function due to structural
damage, glial scarring, and the absence of axonal regenera-
tion. To deal with the complexity of SCI, it is generally
assumed that more effective and successful treatment of SCI
requires combinatorial strategies involving the application
of biomaterials together with cell transplantation and/or
the delivery of bioactive molecules, genetic engineering as
well as rehabilitation.47 In this study, the in vitro and in vivo
biocompatibility of highly superporous cholesterol-modifed
PHEMA hydrogels was tested and it was shown that these
materials can be used to bridge a spinal cord lesion when
implanted into a hemisection cavity. However, a more rele-
vant model, such as chronic SCI induced by a balloon com-
pression lesion, should be used for further assessment of
this material and its suitability for spinal cord repair. More-
over, to improve the regenerative potential of these hydro-
gels, combining hydrogels with transplanted cells and/or

growth factors, as well as further evaluations such as func-
tional assessment involving behavioral testing or axonal
tracing, need to be performed.
CONCLUSIONS
Cholesterol-modified superporous PHEMA scaffolds have
been prepared by the bulk radical copolymerization of
HEMA, CHLMA, and the crosslinking agent EDMA. The modi-
fication of PHEMA with cholesterol has been employed to
improve cell adhesion and the proper integration of the bio-
material after implantation. To increase swellability,
MCMEMA was incorporated in the polymerization recipe
and hydrolyzed to MOEAA, thus introducing carboxyl groups
in the polymer. Three types of PHEMA hydrogels containing
2, 4, or 8 wt % of MOEAA were prepared, differing in both
swelling and surface charge. The repeated loading of ammo-
nium oxalate crystals induced high porosity (65 vol %) and
the formation of interconnected pores 30–100 lm in size,
which is desirable for the ingrowth of stem cells into the
pores of the scaffold for SCI repair. According to the elastic
modulus, hydrogel compliance decreased in the order
P(HEMA-8%MOEAA-CHLMA), P(HEMA-2%MOEAA-CHLMA),
and P(HEMA-4%MOEAA-4%AOEEMA-CHLMA). In cell cul-
ture, highly superporous cholesterol-modified hydrogels
supported the adhesion and growth of MSCs. After trans-
plantation into a hemisected spinal cord, the hydrogels
formed bridge across the lesion and promoted axonal and
Schwann cell infiltration and angiogenesis inside the hydro-
gel pores. No differences in hydrogel integration into the
hemisection cavity or in tissue infiltration were observed
between the hydrogels containing 2, 4, or 8 wt % of
MOEAA.
In conclusion, all types of highly superporous choles-
terol-modified PHEMA hydrogels can be used as scaffolds in
SCI repair. Nevertheless, additional treatment strategies
incorporating aligned pore orientation and/or cell trans-
plantation should be implemented to support the regenera-
tive potential of hydrogel scaffolds.
