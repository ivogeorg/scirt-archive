Abstract
Neural stem cells (NSCs) offer the potential to replace lost tissue after nervous system injury. This study investigated whether grafts of
NSCs (mouse clone C17.2) could also specifically support host axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury and sought to identify
mechanisms underlying such growth. In vitro, prior to grafting, C17.2 NSCs were found for the first time to naturally constitutively secrete
significant quantities of several neurotrophic factors by specific ELISA, including nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. When grafted to cystic dorsal column lesions in the cervical spinal cord of adult rats, C17.2
NSCs supported extensive growth of host axons of known sensitivity to these growth factors when examined 2 weeks later. Quantitative
real-time RT-PCR confirmed that grafted stem cells expressed neurotrophic factor genes in vivo. In addition, NSCs were genetically
modified to produce neurotrophin-3, which significantly expanded NSC effects on host axons. Notably, overexpression of one growth factor
had a reciprocal effect on expression of another factor. Thus, stem cells can promote host neural repair in part by secreting growth factors,
and their regeneration-promoting activities can be modified by gene delivery.

Introduction
The natural capacity of the central nervous system (CNS)
to recover from injury is limited (Ramon y Cajal, 1928/
1991), thus most research into spinal cord injury (SCI)
focuses upon promoting axonal growth and reducing neu-
ronal degeneration. Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs)
could enhance neural repair after SCI either by replacing
host cells that have died or, perhaps more importantly, by
promoting host axonal regeneration. Stem cells could pro-
mote axonal regeneration either by reconstituting a “bridge”
through a lesion site capable of supporting axonal attach-
ment and growth or by secreting diffusible molecules such
as growth factors to attract injured axons. Previous studies
have reported the feasibility of transplantation of neural
stem cells or fetal spinal cord cells into intact or injured
spinal cords and reported limited stem cell differentiation
(Cao et al., 2001; Chow et al., 2000; Hammang et al., 1997;
Liu et al., 1999; McDonald et al., 1999; Onifer et al., 1997;
Shihabuddin et al., 2000; Zompa et al., 1997; for review see
Cao et al., 2002; Keirstead, 2001). Among these studies,
McDonald et al. demonstrated that transplantation of em-
bryonic stem cells promotes functional recovery after SCI,
yet mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect have not
been fully defined. Remyelination of host axons by neural
stem cells may be one mechanism generating functional
recovery (Liu et al., 2000), but whether stem cells also
promote host axonal regeneration is unknown.
The murine C17.2 clone is a prototypical, stable, and
extensively characterized NSC line. Originally derived from
neonatal mouse cerebellum, it evinces the prototypical and
defining features of a stem cell: multipotency, self-renewal,

self-maintenance, expression of stem cell antigens, and re-
sponsiveness to various stem cell trophins (Ryder et al.,
1990; Snyder et al., 1992). Importantly, as required of a
stem cell, C17.2 NSCs contribute to the development of the
organism throughout the neuraxis and across developmental
time periods, from fetal to adult (Lacorazza et al., 1996;
Snyder et al., 1992). In addition, it has been reported that
grafting these cells to the nervous system corrects various
abnormalities in models of abnormal CNS development or
injury (Rosario et al., 1997; Snyder et al., 1995, 1997a,
1997b; Yandava et al., 1999).
The present study investigated whether grafts of NSCs
(as modeled by clone C17.2) could support host axonal
growth after SCI and sought to identify potential mecha-
nisms underlying such growth. We examined the hypothesis
that NSCs constitutively produce and secrete neurotrophic
factors, which could promote the growth of host spinal
axons after injury. In addition, we hypothesized that genet-
ically modifying NSCs to produce augmented levels of
growth factors, in this case neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), would
enhance their growth, differentiation, and regeneration-pro-
moting activities. Findings of this study indicate that grafts
of neural stem cells to sites of spinal cord injury promote
robust axonal growth, that intrinsic growth factor produc-
tion by NSCs corresponds to observed patterns of axonal
growth, and that augmentation of natural growth factor
production by transduction with NT-3 extends the spectrum
of host axon sensitivity to stem cell grafts.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
The C17.2 cell line was generated as previously de-
scribed (Ryder et al., 1990; Snyder et al., 1992). Cells were
grown in high-glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Sigma), 5% horse serum (Gibco), and 2 mM glutamine, on
poly-L-lysine- or poly-L-ornithine-coated (10 g/ml, Sigma)
tissue culture dishes in standard humidified 5% CO2 at
37°C. Cells were maintained in culture either by splitting
1:10 into fresh medium or by feeding twice weekly with a
1:1 mixture of conditioned medium from confluent C17.2
cultures and fresh medium. Primary cultures of Fisher 344
rat fibroblasts (FF227, FF501) were generated from skin
biopsies as previously described (Tuszynski et al., 1996a)
and maintained in standard medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum.
Transduction of C17.2 NSCs and rat primary fibroblasts
with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene
To track grafted cells in vivo, C17.2 NSCs and rat
primary fibroblasts were transduced with the GFP reporter
gene. The GFP cDNA was obtained from phGFP–S65T
(Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by digestion with XbaI and
HindIII. The digested GFP plasmid termini were blunted
with Klenow polymerase and ligated into the HpaI-di-
gested, dephosphorlated plasmid pLXSN vector (Clontech).
Recombinant clones were identified by EcoRI and BamHI
double digestion and the orientation of the insert was ex-
amined by NotI and EcoRI digestion. The plasmid pLXSN–
GFP was then transfected into the stable viral producer line
PA317 utilizing the ecotropic packaging cell line psi-2 as
described previously (Blesch et al., 1999; Tuszynski et al.,
1996a). Virus-containing medium from the producer cells
was collected and used to infect C17.2 cells and rat primary
fibroblasts. GFP-expressing C17.2 NSCs were analyzed and
sorted following standard procedures by a FACS scan with
a standard excitation wavelength of 488 nm. GFP-trans-
duced rat primary fibroblasts were selected using medium
containing G418 (400 g/ml, Sigma), as previously de-
scribed (Tuszynski et al., 1996a).
Transfection of C17.2 NSCs with the NT-3 gene
A previously generated C17.2 subclone (Liu et al., 1999)
was genetically modified to produce and secrete large quan-
tities of NT-3 using the 950-bp human NT-3 gene (gift of
Genentech). A new retroviral vector (pLXIE) was generated
by digesting the plasmid pLNCX (Milter and Rosman,
1989, Clontech) with BclI and HpaI to substitute the NeoR
gene and CMV promoter with a BglII–HpaI fragment con-
taining multiple clone sites, an internal ribosome entry site
(IRES), and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)
gene derived from the plasmid pIRES2–EGFP (Clontech).
Human NT-3 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the 5
NT-3 primer GTGCTCGAGGTGATGTCCATCTTGTTT
containing a XhoI site and the 3 NT-3 primer TGTG-
GATCCTCATGTTCTTCCGATTTTTCT containing a
BamHI site from a plasmid containing human NT-3 (pRK5–
hu-NT-3). The human NT-3 PCR product was digested with
XhoI and BamHI and ligated into the plasmid pLXIE. The
plasmid was transfected into the Phoenix producer cell line
(Kinsella and Nolan, 1996) and NT-3-transduced C17.2
NSCs (“C17.2-NT-3”) were fluorescently sorted as de-
scribed above.
Differentiation of NSCs in vitro
C17.2 and NT-3-transduced C17.2 NSCs were tested for
their differentiation potential in vitro. Cells were seeded
onto 12-mm circular coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine or
poly-L-ornithine (10 g/ml, Sigma) and cultured for up to 3
weeks. Cells were then fixed on coverslips with 4% para-
formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and la-
beled with cell-specific markers for undifferentiated stem
cells (nestin), neural progenitors (MAP-2, -III tubulin),
neurons (Neu N, neurofilament), astrocytes (GFAP), and
oligodendrocytes (APC), as listed below. The number of
labeled cells was then quantified in three randomly selected
fields at 200 under a fluorescence microscope and divided
116 P. Lu et al. / Experimental Neurology 181 (2003) 115–129
by the total number of cells in that field as determined by
phase optics to obtain the mean percentage of labeled cells.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Neurotrophic factor production by C17.2 and C17.2–
NT-3 NSCs in vitro was measured by two-site ELISA as
described (Conner and Varon, 1996). Conditioned medium
from 24-h. cultures was collected after cells were confluent
for 2 days, and EIA/RIA plates (Costar 3590) were coated
with capture antibodies: anti-NGF (polyclonal, 215/11[Con-
ner and Varon, 1996], 1:500); anti-BDNF (gift of Amgen,
polyclonal, 1:20,000); anti-NT-3 (Chemicon, polyclonal,
1:4000); or anti-GDNF (gift of Amgen, monoclonal,
1:1000). Plates were incubated with secondary antibodies
(mouse anti-NGF, Boehringer Mannheim, 1:100; chicken
anti-BDNF, Promega, 1:2500; chicken anti-NT-3, Promega,
1:1000; chicken anti-GDNF, Promega, 1:1000) and then
with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dako, for
NGF detection) or anti-chicken IgY (Promega, for BDNF,
NT-3, and GDNF detection). Soluble colorimetric product
was measured.
Surgery
A total of 44 adult female Fisher 344 rats (160–200 g)
were subjects of this study. NIH guidelines for laboratory
animal care and safety were strictly followed. Animals had
free access to food and water throughout the study. All
surgery was done under anesthesia with a combination (2
ml/kg) of ketamine (25 mg/ml), rompun (1.3 gm/ml), and
acepromazine (0.25 mg/ml).
A spinal cord dorsal column lesion was made at the
cervical (C3) level using a Kopf microwire knife (Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, CA), as previously described
(Weidner et al., 1999). Briefly, after fixation in a spinal
stereotaxic unit, a C3 dorsal laminectomy was performed
and the microwire knife was stereotaxically positioned at
the spinal cord midline. A small dural incision was made,
and the wire knife was lowered into the spinal cord to a
depth of 1.1 mm ventral to the cord dorsal surface and 0.6
mm to the left of the midline. The tip of the wire knife was
then extruded, forming a 1.5-mm-wide wire arc that was
then raised to the dorsal surface of the cord. To ensure
complete axotomy of the dorsal columns, including corti-
cospinal tract and dorsal funicular sensory ascending pro-
jections, spinal tissue was compressed against the micro-
wire knife surface using a microaspiration pipette until all
visible white matter was transected. Complete axotomy
using the wire knife device requires this additional axonal
compression and visual verification. The wire arc was then
retracted back into the wire knife device, and the instrument
was removed from the spinal cord.
After the lesion was completed, 2.5 l of C17.2 NSCs (n
 16 animals), C17.2–NT-3 NSCs (n  16 animals), or
control GFP-expressing rat fibroblasts (FF227, FF501, n 
8 animals, Table 1), resuspended in PBS at a concentration
of 4  104 cells/l, was injected into the epicenter of the
lesion using a PicoSpritzer II (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ).
In addition, 4 animals underwent lesions only (Table 1).
Cyclosporin A (10 mg/kg, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East
Hanover, NJ) was injected intraperitoneally 1 day before
surgery and continued daily in all subjects until sacrifice.
The corticospinal tract (CST) was anterogradely labeled
with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA, MW 10,000, Mo-
lecular Probes, Eugene, OR) immediately after cell grafting
in eight animals with C17.2 NSC grafts, eight with NT-3-
transduced C17.2 NSC grafts, four with fibroblast grafts,
and four with lesions only (Table 1) as previously described
(Blesch et al., 1999; Grill et al., 1997). A total of 100 nl of
a 10% solution of BDA dissolved in H2O was injected into
each of 18 sites spanning the rostral-to-caudal extent of the
motor cortex with a PicoSpritzer (General Valve, Inc.) using
methods and injection coordinates previously reported (Ble-
sch et al., 1999). Animals were perfused 2 weeks after
injections. In addition, ascending dorsal column sensory
axons were transganglionically labeled with cholera toxin B
subunit (CTB, List Biological Lab, CA) injected into both
sciatic nerves 2 weeks after spinal cord lesions, as previ-
ously described (Bradbury et al., 1999). Briefly, 2 l of a
1% solution of CTB dissolved in H2O was injected into
each sciatic nerve using a Hamilton syringe (4 l total per
animal). CTB was injected in four animals with C17.2 NSC
grafts and four with NT-3-transduced C17.2 NSC grafts
(Table 1), and subjects were perfused 4 days later.
Histology and immunocytochemistry
Rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Spinal cords were dissected free,
postfixed overnight at 4°C, and then transferred to 30%
sucrose for 72 h. Sagittal sections (35 m) of spinal cords
from the cervical lesion site were cut on a cryostat, and one
of every seven sections was mounted on gelatin-coated
slides for Nissl staining. The remaining sections were seri-
ally collected into 24-well plates for immunocytochemical
labeling.
Immunolabeling was performed on spinal cord sections
to identify grafted cells and to determine the number and

phenotype of axons responding to lesions and grafts. All
sections were processed free-floating, and endogenous per-
oxidase activity was blocked with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide
as previously described (Grill et al., 1997). Nonspecific
antibody reactions were blocked with 5% horse serum (for
monoclonal antibodies) or 3% goat serum (for polyclonal
antibodies) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, sections were
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies directed
against jellyfish green fluorescent protein (polyclonal anti-
body from Molecular Probes at 1:3000 to label GFP trans-
fected cells), neurofilament (NF; RT97 monoclonal anti-
body from Boehringer Mannheim at 1:250 to label axons),
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; polyclonal antibody
from Chemicon at 1:8000 to label primary sensory axons),
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; monoclonal antibody from
Chemicon at 1:1000 to label coerulospinal axons), serotonin
(5-HT; monoclonal antibody from Chemicon at 1:35,000 to
label raphespinal axons), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT;
polyclonal antibody from Chemicon at 1:500 to label local
motor axons), and cholera toxin B subunit (polyclonal an-
tibody from List Biological Lab at 1:10,000 to label ascend-
ing dorsal column sensory axons). After washes, sections
were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:
200, Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room
temperature followed by a 1-h incubation in avidin–bioti-
nylated peroxidase complex (1:100, Vector Elite Kit) at
room temperature. Diaminobenzidine (0.05%) with nickel
chloride (0.04%) was used as chromagen, with reactions
sustained for 1–6 min at room temperature. The BDA-
labeled corticospinal tract was detected by labeling with
avidin–biotinylated peroxidase complex (1:100, Vector
Elite Kit) incubated overnight at 4°C and visualized with
diaminobenzidine and nickel chloride developed for 5 min
at room temperature. The sections were then mounted on
gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, and coverslipped with
pro-texx mounting medium (Baxter Diagnostics, Deerfield,
IL).
Immunofluorescent labeling was also performed to char-
acterize the state of cellular differentiation and to examine
cell–cell interactions at the host–graft interface. After non-
specific antibody reactions were blocked with 5% goat se-
rum for 1 h at room temperature, cells (fixed on slides from
in vitro studies) or free-floating sections were incubated
with primary antibodies directed against Nestin (monoclo-
nal antibody from, Chemicon at 1:200 to label undifferen-
tiated neural stem cells), MAP-2 (monoclonal antibody
from Chemicon at 1:10,000 to label immature neurons), III
tubulin (monoclonal antibody from Chemicon at 1:750 to
label immature neurons), NeuN (monoclonal antibody from
Chemicon at 1:250 to label mature neurons), NF (RT97
antibody at 1:175 to label mature neurons and axons),
GFAP (polyclonal antibody from Dako at at 1:700 to label
astrocytes), and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC, mono-
clonal antibody from Oncogene at 1:200 to label oligoden-
drocytes) overnight at 4°C. After washes, cells and sections
were incubated with Alexa 488 or 594 conjugated goat
anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:150,
Molecular Probes) for 2.5 h at room temperature. The sec-
tions were then washed, mounted on uncoated slides, and
coverslipped with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology
Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL).
Quantification of growth of axons within grafts
The penetration of axons of different phenotypes into
grafts was quantified using NIH Image software analysis of
immunolabeled sections, as previously described (Tuszyn-
ski et al., 1996a). The margins of the lesion were determined
with phase contrast optics as a distinct change in the cellular
constituency from regions of neurons to a lesion “cavity”
devoid of neurons and occupied by grafted cells. Two ran-
domly selected fields within each graft in the lesion site
were measured in two separate sections from each subject
(four regions total quantified per animal). The number of
pixels occupied by immunolabeled axons within a fixed box
size of 640  480 pixels at 200 magnification was mea-
sured in sections immunolabeled for NF, CGRP, and ChAT
in subjects with C17.2 NSC grafts (n  8), C17.2–NT-3
NSC grafts (n  8), and FF227 fibroblast grafts (n  4; see
Table 1). Similar measurements were performed in subjects
that received CTB injections into the sciatic nerve (n  4
for C17.2 NSC grafts, and n  4 for C17.2–NT-3 NSC
grafts; Table 1). Thresholding values on video images were
chosen such that only immunolabeled axons were mea-
sured, and light nonspecific background labeling was not
detected. Nonspecific staining of objects other than axons,
such as obvious artifactual spots resulting from tissue pro-
cessing, was edited from images as previously reported
(Armstrong et al., 1988). Total labeled pixels were divided
by the sample box size (640  480 pixels) to obtain mean
axon density per pixel in the graft.
Quantitative real-time PCR for in vivo measurement of
growth factor mRNA expression in grafted cells
Two weeks after in vivo grafting, C17.2 NSCs (n4),
C17.2–NT-3 NSCs (n4), and control GFP-transduced rat
fibroblast (FF501, n4, Table 1) cell grafts were carefully
dissected from their grafting sites and immediately frozen
on dry ice for determination of in vivo production of growth
factor mRNA. Total RNA was extracted using Rneasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at 70°C. In addi-
tion, total RNA was isolated from cultured C17.2 NSCs,
C17.2–NT-3 NSCs, and primary fibroblasts in vitro and
from one adult rat hippocampus (as a positive control for
detection of NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 production). The first-
strand cDNA synthesis reaction was carried out from 2.5 g
total RNA using SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis for
RT-PCR Kit with oligo (dT) priming, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In
order to specifically detect mouse neural stem-cell-derived
growth factor gene expression, mouse-specific primers with
118 P. Lu et al. / Experimental Neurology 181 (2003) 115–129
at least one 3 end nucleotide mismatch to rat genes were
designed for the neurotrophic factor genes NGF, BDNF,
and GDNF, based on BLAST comparison of mouse and rat
genes (using Primer Express software, Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). To detect expression of the NT-3 gene
from C17.2 NSC grafts vs human NT-3-transduced C17.2
NSC grafts, NT-3 primers were designed that were both
mouse- and human-specific, but were not rat-specific, by
mismatching one 3 end nucleotide of the forward primer to
the rat gene. The probes were further designed to detect
mouse-specific NGF, BDNF, and GDNF genes and mouse-
and human-specific NT-3 genes by including at least one
nucleotide mismatch to rat genes in the central portion of
the probes, using methods and software described above.
The sequence of primers and probes are as follows: NGF
primers, 5CAGACCCGCAACATCACTGTA3 and 5CC-
ATGGGCCTGGAAGTCTAG3, probe, 5CCAGACTGT-
TTAAGAAACGGAGACTCCACTCACC3; BDNF primers,

5TTGCAGCGGTTCCTGTGAAT3 and 5TCTTAGAA-
TATGGTAAACCAGGTTGTCA3, probe, 5 CGGAGTA-
GAAGGCTAACAAGTGACAAAGTAGGCC3; NT-3
primers, 5CATTCGGGGACACCAGGTC3 and 5TTTG-
CACTGAGAGTTCCAGTGTTT3, probe, 5AAGCCAG-
GCCGGTCAAAAACGGTT3. Primers and probes were
synthesized and purified at Integrated DNA Technologies
(Coralville, IA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control to nor-
malize expression levels of growth factor genes from dif-
ferent stem cell grafts. The primers and probes of mouse and
rat GAPDH were purchased from Applied Biosystems.
To test the specificity of primers for mouse-specific
growth factor genes (or mouse- and human-specific for
NT-3), nonquantitative PCRs were performed using 2 l of
first-strand synthesis cDNA (total 20 l volume) from cul-
tured C17.2 NSCs, C17.2–NT-3 NSCs, primary fibroblasts
(FF501), and rat hippocampus. The 100-l PCR reaction
additionally contained the following components: 0.2 M
of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP mixture, and 2.5 U Taq DNA
polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The PCRs were con-
ducted in a programmable themocycler (Ericomp) using an
initial denature temperature of 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of
94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. A total of 20 l of final PCR
product was separated in a 1.5% agrose gel, stained with
ethidium bromide, and photographed.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed at the
Genomics Core Facility of the University of California at
San Diego using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems) under the following condi-
tions: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, and 45 cycles of
95°C for 15 s plus 60°C for 1 min. The PCR reagents,
except primers and probes, were from the TaqMan PCR
Core Reagent Kit. The targets and endogenous control
GAPDH were amplified in separate tubes according to man-
ufacturer’s instructions, and standard curves were prepared
for both the target and the endogenous reference. For sam-
ples of C17.2 and C17.2–NT-3 grafts, mouse GAPDH was
amplified as an endogenous control using mouse-specific
primers and probes; for samples of rat primary fibroblast
(FF501) grafts (to ensure specificity of the growth factor
probes for mouse genes), rat GAPDH was amplified as an
endogenous control using rat-specific primers and probe.
For each sample, the amount of target and endogenous
reference was determined from the appropriate standard
curve. Then, a standardization factor of endogenous control
GAPDH was determined by finding the maximum value of
GAPDH among the same group of samples and then divid-
ing each value by that maximum value. The target amount
(in nanograms) was calculated as a normalized value by
multiplying the standardization factor by the amount of
target found from the curve.
Statistical analysis
In all quantification procedures, observers were blinded
to the nature of the experimental manipulation. Statistical
differences between two groups were determined by two-
tailed Student’s t test. Multiple group comparisons were
made by ANOVA and post hoc Fisher’s tests, using a
significance level of 95%. Data are presented as means 
standard error of the mean.
Results
C17.2 NSCs survive grafting to spinal cord lesion sites
and migrate for short distances
Histological examination revealed that wire knife lesions
completely transected the dorsal columns and the dorsal
corticospinal tract and that C17.2 and C17.2–NT-3 NSCs
readily survived grafting to the lesion cavity and were well
vascularized (Fig. 1A–E; Fig. 2F ). Fibroblasts also sur-
vived grafting (not shown), whereas animals with lesions
alone exhibited cystic cavities (Fig. 1F). Grafts of mouse
C17.2 NSCs into these cyclosporin-treated rats did not elicit
notable cellular immune responses compared to grafts of
syngenic rat primary fibroblasts (Fig. 1). Lesion size and
graft size were similar among all grafted groups. Most
grafted stem cells remained localized to the injection site,
migrating for maximal distances of only 1–2 mm from the
lesion site (Fig. 1E; Fig. 2F). Transduction with NT-3 did
not affect the distance of stem cell migration. In no case did
tumors form at the lesion/grafting site.
In vitro and in vivo differentiation of NSCs
In vitro, C17.2 NSCs were small and round, with little
morphological evidence of differentiation (Fig. 2A). C17.2

cells expressed the neuroepithelial stem cell marker nestin
in vitro (Fig. 2C), but did not label for the early neuronal
markers MAP-2 and -III tubulin, the mature neuronal
markers NeuN and neurofilament, the astrocytic marker
GFAP, or the oligodendrocytic marker APC after 2–3 weeks
in culture (data not shown). In contrast, C17.2 NSCs trans-
duced to express human NT-3 exhibited extensive neuronal
differentiation in vitro (Fig. 2B, D, and E), consistent with
a previous report (Liu et al., 1999). A total of 60% of C17.2
NSCs transfected with NT-3 exhibited MAP-2 labeling after
2–3 weeks in vitro (Fig. 2D), with occasional cells also
expressing -III tubulin but not neurofilament or NeuN. A
total of 3–4% of NT-3-transfected cells were GFAP-posi-
tive (Fig. 2E). The remaining cells expressed the primitive
neuroepithelial stem cell marker nestin. Notably, after in
vivo grafting, C17.2 NSCs possessed a small round-shaped
morphology and exhibited no evidence of differentiation
(Fig. 1E). Indeed, C17.2 NSCs expressed neither stem cell
(nestin) markers nor specific neuronal or glial markers
(MAP-2, -III tubulin, NeuN, NF, or GFAP and APC) at
the postgrafting time point of 2 weeks. On the other hand,
many NT-3-transfected C17.2 NSCs displayed more mature
neuronal-type morphology after 2 weeks in vivo, containing
bipolar or multipolar extending processes (Fig. 2F, G).
Double fluorescent immunolabeling showed that occasional
NT-3-transduced C17.2 cells expressed the neuronal marker
MAP-2 in vivo (Fig. 2H). However, the majority of NT-3-
transduced C17.2 NSCs in vivo did not express either nestin
or neuronal/glial cell markers (MAP-2, -III tubulin, NeuN,
NF, or GFAP and APC).
C17.2 NSCs support robust growth of spinal motor and
sensory axons after injury; NT-3 transduction amplifies
and extends this growth-promoting effect
NF immunolabeling was entirely absent in lesion sites in
animals that lacked cell grafts. Control, GFP-expressing
fibroblast grafts were modestly penetrated by NF-labeled
axons (Fig. 3A, B). Notably, the extent of axonal penetra-
tion increased 3-fold in recipients of C17.2 NSC grafts
compared to control fibroblast grafts (P  0.05; Fig. 3C, D,
and G). Further, grafts of NT-3-secreting C17.2 NSCs were
penetrated by 4-fold greater numbers of neurofilament-la-
beled axons relative to unmanipulated C17.2 NSCs (P 
0.0001; Fig. 3E, F, and G), a 12-fold increase relative to
fibroblast grafts.
The origin of axons that penetrated grafts was deter-
mined by BDA-, CTB-, and immunolabeling. C17.2 NSC
grafts were penetrated by CGRP-labeled sensory axons
(Fig. 4B) and ChAT-labeled spinal motor axons (Fig. 5B).
Notably, control GFP-expressing fibroblast grafts were
completely devoid of ChAT-labeled axons (Fig. 5A, B).
The density of sensory and motor axons in NSC grafts
significantly exceeded that of GFP-expressing control fibro-
blast grafts when measured by NIH Image analysis (P 
0.001, Fig. 4A, B, and D; P  0.01, Fig. 5A, B, and D).
Thus, NSCs enhanced both the density and the diversity of
axonal growth after spinal cord injury. These axons were
relevant to local spinal circuits, however, rather than to
descending or ascending spinal projections. Compared to
control fibroblast grafts, C17.2 NSC grafts were not pene-
trated by significantly greater numbers of coerulospinal ax-
ons (TH-immunolabeled axons), raphaespinal axons (5-HT
immunolabeled axons), corticospinal axons (BDA-labeled
axons), or CTB-labeled dorsal column sensory axons (see
also below).
Transduction of the NSCs to express NT-3 augmented
the density and diversity of axons penetrating spinal cord
lesion sites (Figs. 3–6). A significantly greater overall num-
ber of axons penetrated C17.2–NT-3 NSC grafts compared
to C17.2 NSC grafts or fibroblast grafts (P  0.0001; Fig.
3). Ascending dorsal column sensory axons penetrated
C17.2–NT-3 NSC grafts more extensively than C17.2 NSC
grafts (P  0.05; Fig. 6). On the other hand, penetration of
CGRP-labeled nociceptive axons into C17.2–NT-3 NSC
grafts was unchanged compared to C17.2 NSC grafts (yet
significantly exceeded penetration of control fibroblast
grafts; Fig. 4), whereas fewer ChAT-labeled motor axons
penetrated C17.2–NT-3 NSC grafts compared to C17.2
NSC grafts alone (P  0.05; Fig. 5B, C, and D). Cortico-
spinal axons did not penetrate grafts.
C17.2 NSCs naturally secrete neurotrophic factors that
are known to promote sensory and motor axon growth
Previously it has been reported that CGRP-expressing
sensory axons are NGF-responsive (Lindsay and Harman,
1989; Otten et al., 1983; Tuszynski et al., 1994) and that

motor neurons are both BDNF- and GDNF-responsive
(Tuszynski et al., 1996b; Vejsada et al., 1998; Yan et al.,
1992). To determine whether a mechanism of NSC-en-
hanced growth of spinal sensory and motor axons was
growth factor secretion by these cells, specific ELISAs for
NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and GDNF protein levels were per-
formed on C17.2 NSCs, C17.2–NT-3 NSCs, and GFP-
expressing fibroblasts in vitro. Whereas primary fibroblasts
expressed no detectable levels of these growth factors, con-
ditioned medium from C17.2 NSCs contained significant
quantities of NGF (7.5  2.5 pg/106 cells/day), BDNF (7.1
 0.1 pg/106 cells/day), and GDNF (70  1 pg/106 cells/
day) (Fig. 7A). NT-3 expression was not detectable in
nontransfected C17.2 NSCs. Interestingly, transduction of
C17.2 NSCs with NT-3 not only resulted in significant
NT-3 production from transduced cells (12,592  8 pg/106
cells/day), but also resulted in a significant increase in NGF
(51.5  7.5 pg/106 cells/day) and BDNF (84.1  0.15
pg/106 cells/day) production and a decline in GDNF pro-
duction to undetectable levels (Fig. 7A). These findings
were replicated in two separate sets of assays.
To confirm that C17.2 NSCs and NT-3-transduced
C17.2 NSCs express NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and GDNF in
vivo, cDNA from these NSC grafts, as well as from
control rat primary fibroblast grafts and rat hippocampus,
were amplified using quantitative real-time PCR. By
choosing mouse- and human-specific primers and probes
(as described under Materials and Methods), only mouse
and human growth factor genes and not rat genes were
detected. Analysis of standard, nonquantitative RT-PCR
products confirmed the specificity of mouse and human
primers: cDNAs of growth factor genes were amplified
only from cultured C17.2 and human NT-3-transduced
C17.2 NSCs, but not from rat hippocampus (where
growth factor genes are normally expressed (Ceccatelli et
al., 1991; Ernfors et al., 1990; Lenhard and Suter-Craz-
zolara, 1998; Pochon et al., 1997) or control rat fibro-
blasts (Fig. 7B). The pattern of growth factor gene ex-

pression in cultured NSCs was similar to the ELISA data
(Fig. 7A, B). Quantitative neurotrophic factor in vivo
gene expression was compared using real-time PCR
among C17.2 graft recipients (n  4), C17.2–NT-3 graft
recipients (n  4), and control rat primary fibroblast
(FF501) graft recipients (n  4, Table 1) 2 weeks after
lesions and cell transplantation. Both mouse and rat
GAPDH cDNAs were amplified as endogenous controls
to normalize growth factor gene expression levels among
samples. With mouse-specific primers and probes, NGF
was expressed in C17.2 (130.6  21.7) and NT-3-trans-
duced C17.2 NSC grafts (217.9  9.7, P  0.01, Fig.
7C). BDNF expression was significantly higher in C17.2
NSC grafts (150.8  24.4) than in C17.2-NT-3 NSC
grafts (52.4  4.0, P  0.001). Similarly, GDNF expres-
sion was higher in C17.2 NSC grafts (348.9  46.0) than
in C17.2–NT-3 NSC grafts (94.5  10.7, P  0.0001).
As expected, human NT-3-transduced C17.2 NSC grafts
contained far greater levels of NT-3 mRNA (114106 
33.6105) than C17.2 NSC grafts (226.7  7.1, P 
0.0001). Rat primary fibroblast grafts contained no de-
tectable levels of growth factor mRNAs using the
same mouse- and human-specific primers and probes
(Fig. 7C). Patterns of growth factor gene expression in
vivo were similar to those of neurotrophic factor protein
measurements obtained by ELISA in vitro and confirmed
that C17.2 neural stem cells secrete significant levels of
growth factors that correlate with observed patterns of
growth from motor and sensory axons. Only one dif-
ference in a single group was found between in vitro
growth factor protein and in vivo mRNA measurements:
levels of BDNF gene expression in NT-3-transduced
C17.2 cells were lower in vivo than predicted by in vitro
ELISA (Fig. 7A, B). Nonetheless, overall findings were
consistent in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the reduction in
GDNF expression by NT-3-transduced NSCs correlated

Discussion
The present study demonstrates that C17.2 neural stem
cells can elicit significant host axonal growth after SCI,
presenting a cellular substrate to the lesion site that supports
axonal extension even in the absence of stem cell differen-
tiation. The grafted C17.2 NSCs support extensive growth
of axonal systems of several classes, including motor and
sensory axons that have previously been reported to exhibit
sensitivity to NGF, BDNF, or GDNF (Lindsay and Harmar,
1989; Otten et al., 1983; Tuszynski et al., 1994, 1996b;
Vejsada et al., 1998; Yan et al., 1992). Indeed a likely
mechanism contributing to stem cell-induced growth of
axons in this study is the constitutive production of the
growth factors NGF, BDNF, and GDNF both in vitro and in
vivo. Genetically modifying stem cells to express another
growth factor, NT-3, induces stem cell differentiation and
expands the density and diversity of host axonal growth, yet
reduces expression of GDNF and BDNF in vivo which in
turn leads to a reduction (but not elimination) of local motor
axon growth. Thus, growth factor expression in stem cells is
dynamically regulated, likely as a function of differentiation
state, and is further influenced by the production of other
growth factors in the cell.
Recently it has been reported that embryonic stem cell
grafts to the spinal cord promote functional recovery after
injury (McDonald et al., 1999) and that one potential mech-
anism of this beneficial effect may be reduction of demy-
elination (Liu et al., 2000). Although demyelination con-
tributes to functional loss after SCI, the majority of
functional deficit after injury is attributable to loss of axonal
connectivity. Thus, the present demonstration that stem
cells augment host axonal growth presents an important
mechanism whereby neural stem cells can contribute to
reconstitution of neural structure independent of their dif-
ferentiation fate.
The grafting of NSCs to specific regions of the nervous
system has previously been reported to induce differentia-
tion of cells to lineages appropriate to the environment in
which they are placed (Brüstle et al., 1997; Gage et al.,
1998; Lundberg et al., 1996; Snyder et al., 1997a; Suhonen
et al., 1996). For example, hippocampal-derived NSCs
placed in the ventral migratory stream adopt the phenotype
of olfactory system neurons (Suhonen et al., 1996). Clone
C17.2 NSCs grafted to other models of injury and degen-
eration, including phototoxic-induced cortical neuron de-
generation (Snyder et al., 1997a) or demyelination (Yan-
dava et al., 1999), induce differentiation and adoption of
mature CNS cellular markers intrinsic to each model. In this
study, C17.2 stem cell grafts to the injured spinal cord did
not express mature markers of either neuronal or glial lin-
eages; thus these cells did not reconstitute the cellular char-

assays, with each assay containing samples at three different dilutions (1:1;
1:5; 1:50). (B) Nonquantitative RT-PCR in vitro demonstrates amplifica-
tion of neurotrophic factor genes using mouse-specific primers (for NT-3,
both mouse- and human-specific) from cDNA of C17.2 cells (lane 1) and
NT-3-transduced C17.2 NSCs (lane 2), but not from cDNA of control rat
hippocampus (lane 3) or rat fibroblasts (lane 4). The endogenous control
GAPDH is amplified with mouse-specific primers in lanes 1 and 2 and with
rat-specific primers in lanes 3 and 4. (C) Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
with mouse-specific primers and probes (for NT-3, both mouse- and hu-
man-specific) shows expression of the growth factor genes NGF, BDNF,
GDNF, and NT-3 at different levels in mouse-derived C17.2 NSC grafts
(C17.2, n  4) vs NT-3-transduced C17.2 NSC grafts (C17.2–NT-3, n 
4). Gene expression is not detectable in control GFP-transduced primary rat
fibroblast grafts (n  4). The expression of growth factor genes is nor-
malized (nanograms) relative to endogenous control GAPDH gene expres-
sion (see Materials and Methods for details).

acter of the preinjured spinal cord. This lack of differenti-
ation may be a function of complexities intrinsic to SCI,
including glial activation, inflammation (including altered
cytokine levels), and extensive regional cellular degenera-
tion. Yet the failure to differentiate did not compromise the
ability of NSCs to promote neural repair via another mech-
anism: promoting host axonal growth. Indeed, it is possible
that more extensive differentiation of stem cells could
downregulate the expression of some genes that contribute
to host axonal regeneration, including growth factors. When
C17.2 NSCs were transduced to express NT-3, they differ-
entiated more extensively and down-regulated expression of
GDNF both in vivo and in vitro. This loss of GDNF ex-
pression correlated with a significant reduction of GDNF-
sensitive motor axon penetration of the graft/lesion site. (It
is not the case that transfection with NT-3 simply over-
whelmed the protein synthesis capacity of stem cells result-
ing in a loss of GDNF production, because expression of
NGF increased.) This reciprocal relationship between the
enhanced expression of one growth factor at the expense of
the expression of the other is intriguing. One explanation for
this observation may be that GDNF is expressed by NSCs in
their more immature state; NT-3 induces the cells toward a
neuronal phenotype in which GDNF secretion is not char-
acteristic. Alternatively, an as yet undefined complex recip-
rocal interplay may exist between growth factor signal
transduction pathways.
Having established the feasibility of engineering NSCs
to overexpress various growth factors to pattern host axonal
regrowth, one can tailor the specific choice of growth factor
to the class of axon that is targeted. For example, enhance-
ment of NT-3 secretion is well suited to dorsal column
sensory axons and is less appropriate for motor neuron
projections. For the latter, augmentation of GDNF would be
appropriate, a growth factor that is constitutively produced
by the NSCs. Interestingly, one will need to coordinate the
administration of these growth factors such that their appli-
cation is additive and not antagonistic. The simultaneous
cografting of subclones of NSCs, each engineered to over-
express a different growth factor, may yield the most opti-
mal and compatible therapies. Future investigations will
address this issue.
A number of studies have reported a propensity of neural
stem cells to migrate in the adult central nervous system.
Cells of the subventricular zone of adult mammals repopu-
late the olfactory bulb throughout life by migrating through
the rostral migratory stream (Luskin et al., 1997). Hip-
pocampal precursor cells, if implanted into the rostral mi-
gratory stream, also migrate to the olfactory bulb (Gage et
al., 1998; Suhonen et al., 1996). C17.2 NSCs implanted into
the developing nervous system reportedly distribute to di-
verse locations of the brain and spinal cord (Snyder et al.,
1992, 1997b). In the present study, grafted C17.2 NSCs
remained within close proximity to the lesion/implantation
site, filling the lesion cavity and migrating only short dis-
tances in the host cord. Although the specific “tropic” sig-
nals that influence stem cell migration in the nervous system
remain to be defined, the restriction of NSCs to the lesion
site in this SCI model may be optimal for initiating and
supporting axonal growth through the lesion cavity. Indeed,
the growth of NSCs in this lesion model was well-con-
trolled, with no tumor formation and no cord distortion.
Future studies will determine whether cell migration occurs
at longer time points after grafting to sites of SCI.
The ability of stem cells to support axonal regeneration,
as demonstrated in the present study, taken together with the
previously demonstrated ability of NSCs to integrate in a
stable fashion in other regions of the nervous system, sug-
gests their potential utility as vehicles for gene therapy to
promote CNS repair. The present findings indicate that stem
cells can be transduced to express very high levels of neu-
rotrophic factors, resulting in modification of their axonal
growth-promoting properties in the injured spinal cord.
Compared to previous studies utilizing grafts of genetically
modified fibroblasts (Grill et al., 1997), these NSCs elicited
responses from a broader range of host axons, most likely
attributable to their constitutive production of growth fac-
tors. Future studies will examine the effects of overexpress-
ing other growth factors in NSCs through extended time
points in vivo to further characterize the potential of these
multipotent cells to constitute useful vehicles for CNS gene
therapy in a variety of CNS disorders.
