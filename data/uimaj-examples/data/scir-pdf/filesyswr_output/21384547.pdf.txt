Abstract: Biomaterials and neurotrophic factors represent
two promising strategies for spinal cord injury repair. In this
study, a combinatorial approach combining the PLGA nerve
conduits and the recombinant human neurotrophin-3 (rhNT3)
was utilized in a spinal cord injury animal model. After com-
plete transection of the thoracic cord in rats, rhNT3 was
administered as a single dose to the host cord caudal to a 2-
mm conduit. Axonal regrowth was enhanced, as indicated by
immunostaining and neurofilament-positive area measure-
ment. Neural regrowth was further demonstrated via the ret-
rograde tracing across the lesion. The animals implanted
with the PLGA scaffold and rhNT3 exhibited significantly
improved performance in BBB rating scale and grid walk
tests. These observations suggest that PLGA nerve conduits
combined with exogenous NT3 may serve as an alternative
therapeutic approach for spinal cord injury repair. VC 2011 Wiley

INTRODUCTION
Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in axonal degeneration and
neuronal necrosis. The microenvironment after SCI in adults
is much less receptive to regrowth than in neonates,1 thus
hindering the regeneration of damaged nerves. However,
accumulating evidence since 1980s has demonstrated that
the central nervous system (CNS) in adults can regenerate
in a supportive environment following injuries such as SCI.2
The current research included inhibiting the formation of
glial scar or myelin, such as chondroitin sulfate proteogly-
cans and NOGO3–7; supplying growth-promoting cues, such
as neurotrophic factors8; transplanting cells9–13; activating
the intrinsic capacity of neuronal regeneration programs.14
Despite extensive research dedicated to SCI repair, the mul-
tifaceted nature of SCI has hampered therapeutic efficacy of
current treatment strategies. Consequently, combinatorial
measures, including neurotrophic factors and biomaterials,15
have being investigated in potential protocols for SCI repair.
Neurotrophin family members consist of nerve growth
factor, brain derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3
(NT3), neurotrophin-4/5, and neurotrophin-6. In particular,
NT3 plays a crucial role in nerve regeneration in the CNS,16
especially the corticospinal tracts (CST). CST is one of the
most critical motor paths in humans and animals. NT3
enhances both corticospinal neuronal survival and cortico-
spinal fiber sprouting to partially restore the motor and
sensory functions.17–21 In addition, Wallerian degeneration
facilitates axonal growth in the presence of NT3, primarily
due to the neuroprotective and neuroreparative functions of
microglia and macrophages during Wallerian degenera-
tion.22–25
Tissue engineering has recently emerged as a promising
approach for SCI repair, especially during massive loss of
tissue structure. Compared with allografts or autografts, bio-
materials of functional scaffolds26 are readily available and
do not require additional operation, thus providing an
attractive alternative for SCI repair. In particular, bio-artifi-
cial nerve guidance conduits, made of distinct biomaterials,
can reconstruct spinal cord tissue architecture and provide
guidance for regenerating axons.27–31
Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is an U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approved biomaterial.32–36 PLGA-based
nanoparticles or microsphere,34–37 nanofibers,38,39 con-
duits,30,40 and membrane41 have been extensively employed

for nerve regeneration. Multichannel PLGA nerve conduits
with porous architectures were recently manufactured and
proved useful for SCI reconstruction.32 Multichannel nerve
conduits are tissue-engineering scaffolds functioning to
restrict dispersion of regenerating axons.42 In multichannel
PLGA, the channels are aligned in parallel, and bundles of
regular ladder-like inter connecting pores (140 6 25 lm
and 17 6 5 lm in width) serve to bridge the open channels
to achieve more precise orientation. Importantly, the charac-
teristic high porosity and interconnectivity facilitates neuro-
trophin entry and waste drainage; furthermore, the optimal
degradation rate is conducive to nerve regeneration and
also prevents cumbersome absorption by surrounding
tissues.32
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of multi-
channel PLGA scaffold combined with exogenous NT3 imme-
diately following complete transection of the spinal cord
in vivo. Motor functional recovery was assessed by the
Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale and grid
walk test. Axonal regrowth was examined by nerve fiber im-
munostaining. Retrograde tracing and electrophysiology of
cortical somatosensory evoked potential (CSEP) were also
carried out.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
PLGA nerve conduits were obtained from Sun Yat-Sen Uni-
versity (Guangzhou, China). PLGA with longitudinally paral-
lel-aligned channels and hierarchical pore architecture were
manufactured using injection molding, thermally induced
phase separation (TIPS) and particulate leaching.32
Recombinant human NT3 (rhNT3) was prepared in our lab.
Briefly, human NT3 gene was cloned from fetal brain cDNA
into bacterial expression vector. After transformation of
E.coli BL21 strain, rhNT3 expression was induced with
1 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37C
for 5 h. The rhNT3 proteins in the inclusion body were
renatured at 4C for three days, then purified with nickel
chelate chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The pu-
rity attained was determined above 95% according to the
SDS-PAGE result. The biological activity was determined by
assaying neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
explants, similar to the methods of Ruitenberg et al.43
Animal surgery
Fifty female Wistar rats, each weighing 180–220 g, were
used in this study. Animal experiments were carried out
according to the guidelines approved by Institutional Com-
mittee on the Care and Use of Animals in 2006. Animals
were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 3.6%
chloral hydrate (1 mL/100 g body weight) and randomly di-
vided into five groups. In the first group (PLGA, n ¼ 12),
rats were subjected to dorsal laminectomy. T8-T10 spinal
segments were exposed and completely transected with
angled microscissors to form a 2 mm long cavity. Subse-
quently, a 2-mm PLGA nerve conduit was implanted into
the lesion gap. In the second group (N3, n ¼ 12), rhNT3
(200 lg/mL, 15 lL) was administered by a microsyringe
into the caudal segment close to the lesion within 20 min.
In the third group (PLGAþN3, n ¼ 12), animals were
implanted with PLGA followed by rhNT3 (200 lg/mL, 15
lLinjection into the adjacent caudal spinal cord. The fourth
group consisted of animals that were transected without
additional treatment (control, n ¼ 8), and animals of the
last group were subjected to only laminotomy (sham, n ¼
6). After the operation, surgical sites were sutured and the
rats were put back to their cages. The animals received
extensive care, including twice daily bladder emptying.
Twenty thousand unit penicillin was administered for a
week, and food and drinking water were freely accessible.
Neurofilament immunostaining
Sixteen weeks after surgery, all animals were anesthetized
and perfused with saline solution (0.9% in sterile water)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buf-
fered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The spinal cord encompassing
the lesion was carefully dissected and postfixed in the same
paraformaldehyde. The spinal cord was then immersed in
20% sucrose buffer for 48 h, and 20-lm frozen sections
were obtained and stored at 20C. Sections were blocked
in 10% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature for
2 h. Samples were then incubated with primary antibodies,
including mouse antineurofilament antibody (NF200, mono-
clonal, 1:200, Millipore) and rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acid
protein (anti-GFAP) antibody (polyclonal, 1:200, abcam),
overnight at 4C followed by 1h at 37C. The sections were
incubated with Alexa Flour 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG
(1:100, Invitrogen) and Alexa Flour 488-conjugated anti-rab-
bit IgG (1:200, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37C. Fluorescence
was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM
IRE2, Germany); the fluorescence images were digitized and
NF200-positive areas were calculated using Image-pro Plus
software. The background and nonspecific staining in each
digital image was excluded by adjusting intensity threshold.
NF200 labeled axons displayed above threshold signals, and
the percentage of area labeled with NF200 positive fibers
was determined. The investigators were blind to the test.
Hindlimb locomotor function analysis
Functional recovery was evaluated by the BBB rating
scale44,45 and grid walk test45 for 16 weeks postsurgery.
The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale was an open
field (overground) locomotor scale to evaluate functional re-
covery of rats and became a common practical scale. In the
BBB rating scale, the movement of the rats’ hindlimb was
paid great attention. The scale ranged from a score of 0 to
21, in which 0 represented complete paralyses while 21
indicated normal state. This evaluation was performed for 4
min each rat in a blind manner. In the latter experiment, the
rats were allowed to climb a 70-cm-high and 45 sloped
grids (10  10 mm2 holes). The weight-supported and the
plantigrade steps were considered as the right steps. The
weight-supported and the plantigrade steps were consid-
ered as the right steps. The total number of steps that a rat
used to cross the grids and the number of right steps were
counted. This experiment was videotaped (Canon S3/S5)
272 FAN ET AL. PLGA NERVE CONDUITS AND NEUROTROPHIN-3
and analyzed off-line in a blind manner in a frame-by-frame
way. The percentage of the right steps was calculated by the
right number of steps/the total number of steps. The inves-
tigators were blind to the tests.
Retrograde tracing
Ten days before being sacrificed, five rats from each of the
four groups (control, N3, PLGA, and PLGAþN3) were anes-
thetized as above. After the transected site was exposed a
second time, 0.5 lL retrograde tracer hydroxystilbamidine
(4% w/v in saline solution, Molecular Probes) was injected
at 5 mm below the injury site within 15 min. After extended
retrograde transport of the tracer through CST, animals
were sacrificed as described above. Totally, 10 lm sections
were used for hydroxystilbamidine labeling. The retrograde
tracing of hydroxystilbamidine was examined immediately
under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRE2, Germany).
Electrophysiology of CSEP
To investigate whether the sensory signals from below the
lesion may be conveyed to the cortex, CSEP was measured
immediately before the rats were killed (performed at Sun
Yat-Sen University). The sensorimotor cortex (SMC) was
exposed with the animal mounted on the stereotaxic appa-
ratus (NARISHIGE, Japan), and electrodes were attached to
the exposed sciatic nerves and SMC. Bipolar stimulating
electroduces and monopolar recording electrodues were
used to induce and record electrical activity respectively.
CSEP in response to the Stimulus Isolator (A365, World
Prcision Instruments, USA) was recorded by an Isolated Bio-
logical Amplifier (ISO-DAM, world precision instruments,
USA). Intensity: 5 mV, duration: 0.2 ms.
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean values 6 standard deviation.
The statistical significance of differences between the
groups was evaluated by one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc
test. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05.
RESULTS
Implantation of PLGA conduit in combination
with exogenous NT3 treatment promoted
nerve fiber regrowth
Next, we examined nerve fiber regrowth. As shown in Fig-
ure 1(A), the scaffold served as a structural support
FIGURE 1. (A) The entire spinal cord including the lesion was care-
fully harvested. The PLGA nerve conduits and NT3 both contributed
to tissue structural integrity, whereas a large gap in the lesion site
was still present in the control. (B) The longitudinal section of NF200
stained fibers (red) showed robust axonal regrowth in the PLGAþN3
group, with decreasing degrees of regrowth observed in the PLGA,
NT3 and control groups. The PLGA scaffold and NT3 supplied more
favorable environment to the lesion segment, therefore enhanced
more nerve fiber regrowing. While in the rostral or caudal stumps, as
the microenvironment was less receptive, more nerve fibers degener-
ated and reduced greatly. The GFAP-positive cells (green) were found
to be trapped at the adjacent spinal cord of the lesion, and indicated
slight reactive astrocyte and glial scar formation in the PLGAþN3
group, whereas more GFAP-positive cells invaded into the lesion in
the control. The border of the lesion-host tissue is indicated by dash
lines. (C) The magnified image of regrowing fibers in the transplant in

NF200 positive area in the PLGAþN3 group was significantly larger
than that of the other groups, with the control being most inferior.

0.01). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, significance between the groups. [Color

bridging between the caudal and rostral stumps of the host
spinal cord. Neurofilament staining (red) was used to iden-
tify regrowing nerve fibers in the lesion site. GFAP-positive
cells (green) were found in the rostral and caudal stumps of
the host spinal cord [Figure 1(B)]. The NF200 positive fibers
revealed that the scaffold and the rhNT3 may greatly pro-
mote axonal regrowth [Figure 1(B,C)]. Significantly enhanced
axonal growth in the PLGAþN3 group was observed relative
to that in the control, PLGA and N3 groups [Figure 1(D)].
These observations indicated that the combination of the
PLGA scaffold and the rhNT3 significantly enhanced nerve
fiber regrowth.
Implantation of PLGA conduit in combination with
exogenous NT3 treatment promoted recovery
of hindlimb locomotor function
We first examined the recovery of hindlimb locomotor func-
tion in the groups of animals indicated in the Materials and
Method. The 21-point system is applied to rats from com-
plete paralysis (0) to normal.21 Sham-operated animals
appeared normal based on the BBB [Figure 2(A), upper
panel] and grid walk tests [Figure 2(B)], whereas the rats in
the control group showed essentially no functional improve-
ment. The BBB scores in the control group were 0.375 6
0.518, 0.75 6 0.886, 0.75 6 0.886 at the 7th, 12th, 16th
week, respectively. In the N3 group, the BBB scores were
0.5 6 0.756, 0.875 6 0.835, and 1.25 6 1.04 at the 7th,
12th, 16th week, respectively. In the PLGA group, the BBB
scores were 0.875 6 0.641, 1.125 6 0.641, 1.625 6 0.916
at the 7th, 12th, 16th week, respectively. Animals in the
PLGAþN3 group showed no voluntary movement immedi-
ately after the surgery, but appeared to gradually recover
during the following 16 weeks. The average BBB score for
the PLGAþN3 rats group was 2.63 6 2.45, 2.38 6 1.69, and
3.50 6 1.69 at the 7th 12th 16th week, respectively. Signifi-
cant difference was observed between the PLGAþN3 and
the control animals by week 7. Likewise, the BBB score for
the PLGAþN3 group was also significantly higher than those
of the N3 and PLGA groups [Figure 2(A)]. In the grid walk
test, animals were evaluated at 30, 60, and 150 days after
the surgery. The performance of the PLGAþN3 animals was
significantly superior to that of control animals and the N3
and PLGA animals. The mean percentage in the PLGAþN3
group was 10.50 6 6.40%, 7.50 6 7.23%, and 13.50 6
3.66% at 32, 60, and 150 days after the surgery, respec-
tively [Figure 2(B)]. Taken together, these results indicated
that the PLGAþN3-treated animals showed improved per-
formance in hindlimb locomotor function.
Retrograde tracing indicated extension of the regrowing
nerve fibers beyond the lesion site
Retrograde tracing of hydroxystilbamidine was observed
through the lesion in PLGAþN3 group. Hydroxystilbami-
dine-labeled cells or fibers were markedly reduced in the
rostral stumps of the injury site and encompassed a dis-
tance of 850 6 100 lm [Figure 3(A,D)], significantly longer
than that of the control, PLGA, N3 groups. Correspondingly,
positive hydroxystilbamidine-labeled fibers were seen in the
rostral spinal cord [Figure 3(B)], whereas similar positive
area extended from the caudal stump through the conduit
into the rostral stump was absent in the control, N3 and
PLGA groups [Figure 3(A)]. Furthermore, only a few hydro-
xystilbamidine-labeled cells were found in the brain [Figure
3(C)]. The retrograde observations indicated nerve fibers
regrowth across the lesion.

rating scale and grid walk test. (A) BBB scores at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

The value of the sham group and a magnified view of the other val-
ues for comparison were given. The statistical significance between
the four groups was determined. There was significant difference

No evoked potential between sciatic nerves
and the SMC
CSEP is indicative of sequential activation along the somato-
sensory pathways when peripheral nerves were electrically
stimulated. Our results showed that rats in the sham-oper-
ated group exhibited normal response (Figure 4). In con-
trast, there was no evoked potential recorded in the animals
of the control, PLGA, N3, and PLGAþN3 groups (Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
Synergistic effects of the scaffold and NT3 in axonal
regrowth
A single therapeutic approach is generally believed to be
insufficient to restore SCI. Growth factors, such as NT3, may
stimulate neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. In the
rat models of Tuszynski’s, the spinal cord tissue of only 1.1
mm ventral to the dorsal cord surface and 1.1 mm to the
left of the midline was transected.19 In our study, however,
the T8-T10spinal cord was completely transected. Therefore,
not only sensory axons but also motor axons were seriously
injured in the animals in this study. Since all the fibers were
completely transected, the observed neurofilament positive
fibers likely corresponded to axonal regrowth. Axonal
FIGURE 3. (A) There was a great deal of hydroxystilbamidine positive
fibers in the caudal to the lesion, while much less in the rostral stump
in each group. Retrograde tracing of hydroxystilbamidine showed
that it traversed the lesion and extended for a limited distance in the
PLGAþN3 group, but not in the other groups. The positive hydroxys-
tilbamidine fibers in the rostral stumps indicated the regenerating
ascending fibers. Scale Bar: 100lm. (B) The magnified image showed
hydroxystilbamidine-positive fibers in the rostral spinal cord in the
PLGAþN3 group. It appeared that the hydroxystilbamidine located
along the regenerating nerve fibers in the rostral stump. Scale Bar:

dine-positive fibers. (C) Only a few and weakly labeled cells were
observed in the brain section. Scale Bar: 200 lm (left) and 500 lm
(right). The arrows indicate hydroxystilbamidine-positive cells. (D)

regrowth has been observed not only in the channels but
also in the porous wall.46 Therefore, the neurofilament-
stained axons in the entire transverse section, but not those
in individual channels, were quantified, and the results dem-
onstrated an apparently synergistic role of the PLGA nerve
conduits and rhNT3.
Previously, Schwann-cell containing multichannel scaf-
folds had been used to promote axon regeneration.30 In this
study, the enhanced connectivity of the interlumenal surface
facilitates inward delivery of rhNT3 and outward diffusion
of metabolized substances, thus allowing significant axonal
regrowth in the PLGAþN3 group. On the other hand, the ad-
jacent spinal cord displayed a weak response to the injury
and subsequently induced slight reactive astrocyte and glial
scar formation. In the NT3 alone group, the massive loss of
spinal cord tissue may have rendered the animals incapable
of robust axonal regrowth. The PLGA alone group may also
be deficient in nerve fiber regrowth. While it is difficult to
directly compare our study with that by Moore et al.30 due
to different living time of the animals, the scaffold in this
study seemed to allow efficient diffusion of growth factors
and exhibited synergistic effects in SCI repair. It is possible
that the scaffold coupled with exogenous NT3 constituted
favorable microenvironment for axonal growth.
Partial hindlimb locomotor functional recovery
indicated in the BBB rating scale and the grid walk test
The contribution of the scaffold and NT3 to functional
improvement was evaluated by the BBB rating scale and
grid walk test. The animals were assigned a BBB score of
3.50 and 13.5% of the right steps in grid walk test. The
BBB score showed more dramatic increase over the first
seven weeks. Previously, 5–10% of CST was estimated to be
required for improved locomotor function after SCI.47 In
this study, however, only about 1% of the total area was
NF200 positive in the PLGAþN3 group, the density of nerve
fibers relative to the functional native tissue was about 10%
(the average percentage of the positive area in the
PLGAþN3 and sham groups was 0.96% and 11.67%, respec-
tively); furthermore, axonal regeneration was not expected
to take place during this early time window. Since it
remained unclear whether the observed functional recovery
was caused by regenerating fibers reconnecting to appropri-
ate targets below the lesion,48 it is possible that plasticity
may be crucial for early functional improvement. The
regrowing nerve fibers may help establish synapses, eventu-
ally leading to functional improvement. Finally, synergistic
effects of the PLGA scaffold and growth factors were
observed, as either the scaffold or NT3 alone was insuffi-
cient in enhancing functional recovery.
Further demonstration of axonal regrowth
by retrograde tracing
Growing nerves need to traverse the scaffold and the glial
scarring to achieve optimal recovery. Given the well-docu-
mented role of NT3 in CST,16,17,25,49 NT3 was expected to
enhance restructuring of ascending and descending axons in
this study. In the retrograde tracing, a large number of
hydroxystilbamidine-labeled fibers were trapped near the
host-transplant border. The retrograde tracing showed
extension of a subset of fibers, indicating regrowth of
ascending axons. However, little or no retrograde tracing
was observed in the brainstem [Figure 3(E)], suggesting
that the axonal regeneration of CST was limited.
Limited regeneration as demonstrated with
electrophysiology
The result of CSEP demonstrated limited axonal regenera-
tion. It is possible that a greater number of axons were
required for the long-distance conduction between the two
sites of sciatic nerves and SMC; alternatively, the observed
recovery may be partly attributable to the re-established
supraspinal input across the transplant50
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our experiments demonstrated beneficial
effects of the multichannel and porous PLGA nerve conduits
coupled with exogenous rhNT3 in promoting neural
regrowth and functional recovery. Future work will aim to
optimize the interaction between the scaffold and growth
factors while retaining the full activity of the growth factors.
