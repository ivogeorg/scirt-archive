ABSTRACT
Conflicting findings exist regarding the link between 
functional recovery and the regrowth of spinal 
tracts across the lesion leading to the restoration 
of functional contacts. In the present study, we 
investigated whether functional locomotor recovery 
was attributable to anatomical regeneration at 
postnatal day 1 (PN1), PN7, PN14 and in adult 
rats two months after transection injury at the 
tenth thoracic segment of the spinal cord. The 
Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores showed that 
transection led to a failure of hindlimb locomotor 
function in PN14 and adult rats. However, PN1 and 
PN7 rats showed a significant level of stepping 
function after complete spinal cord transection. 
Unexpectedly, unlike the transected PN14 and 
adult rats in which the spinal cord underwent limited 
secondary degeneration and showed a scar at the 
lesion site, the rats transected at PN1 and PN7 
showed massive secondary degeneration both 
anterograde and retrograde, leaving a >5-mm gap 
between the two stumps. Furthermore, retrograde 
tracing with fluorogold (FG) also showed that FG 
did not cross the transection site in PN1 and PN7 
rats as in PN14 and adult rats, and re-transection 
of the cord caused no apparent loss in locomotor 
performance in the rats transected at PN1. Thus, 
these three lines of evidence strongly indicated that 
the functional recovery after transection in neonatal 
rats is independent of regrowth of spinal tracts across 
the lesion site. Our results support the notion that 
the recovery of locomotor function in developing 
rats may be due to intrinsic adaptations in the 
spinal circuitry below the lesion that control hindlimb 
locomotor activity rather than the regrowth of spinal 
tracts across the lesion. The difference in secondary 
degeneration between neonatal and adult rats 
remains to be explored.

INTRODUCTION
It is widely accepted that neonatal rats receiving a 
complete spinal cord transection spontaneously recover 
a significant level of locomotor performance[1-4], whereas 
minimal recovery is attained in transected adult rats[5-8]. 
The mechanisms involved are controversial. Many lines 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 509–516510
of evidence suggest that recovery of locomotor function 
in neonatal rats receiving a complete transection may 
be due to spontaneous regeneration through the lesion 
site[4, 9-12]. For example, Wakabayashi et al.[4] reported 
that neonatal rats undergoing a complete spinal cord 
transection regained some hindlimb function, which was 
attributable to the regeneration of some descending tracts 
based on retrograde labeling. Moreover, they also found a 
positive correlation between the number of labeled neurons 
in each of the supraspinal nuclei and the locomotor 
performance of the rats[4]. In contrast, other investigators 
have suggested that the recovery of locomotor function 
in neonatal rats receiving a complete transection may be 
due to changes in the lumbosacral neuronal circuitry rather 
than the regeneration of axons across the lesion[3,13-15], 
based on their finding that no signs of regeneration 
occurred through the transection site by either anterograde 
or retrograde tracing[3,13-15]. Fundamental evidence for 
the latter suggestion comes from a recent study showing 
that re-transection of the cord causes no apparent loss 
in locomotor performance in neonatally-transected rats[3]. 
In this study, we re-evaluated the link between functional 
recovery and regrowth of spinal tracts across the lesion 
leading to the restoration of functional contacts in postnatal 
day 1 (PN1), PN7, PN14 and adult rats by using extensive 
anatomical evidence through morphological analysis 
around the lesion site, retrograde labeling, and re-
transection experiments. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Data were collected from 50 Sprague-Dawley PN1, PN7, 
PN14 and adult rats (n = 10 for each age). All surgical 
interventions and subsequent care and treatment were 
approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals for 
Teaching and Research of the University of Hong Kong.
Surgical Procedures
As described previously[16, 17], animals were anesthetized 
under deep hypothermia (for PN1 and PN7 rats) or with 
ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg) (for PN14 
and adult rats). A posterior mid-line incision was made 
to expose the thoracic spine. Laminectomy was then 
performed to expose the spinal cord. After opening the dura 
matter, a complete transection of the cord was performed at 
T10 using a pair of spring scissors. A fine glass probe was 
gently passed through the transection site and the cut ends 
of the cord were then lifted to verify that the transection 
was complete. After the operation, the superficial wound 
was closed with 5-0 sutures and surgical wound clips. The 
postoperative survival period was 2 months. 
Quantitative Assessment of Locomotor Performance
To assess locomotor performance two months after 
surgery, we used the BBB open-field locomotor scale 
developed by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan[18]. Rats were 
allowed to move individually for 5 min in an open field, 
which was a wooden square enclosure with a smooth, non-
slip floor (150 cm each side, 25 cm wall height). Locomotor 
performance was videotaped and given a score ranging 
from 0 to 21 based on the hindlimbs. Values for the left and 
right extremities were averaged.
Retrograde Labeling with Fluorogold (FG)
Four days before the end of the study, the spinal cord of 
some rats in the PN1, PN7, PN14 and adult groups (n 
= 5) were re-transected two segments below the initial 
transection site. Then, FG-soaked gelfoam was inserted 
at the new transection site to retrogradely label spinal 
pathways reaching specific regions of the brain. Intact 
young adult rats were also used for FG retrograde labeling. 
Perfusion and Tissue Processing 
At the end of the postoperative survival period, the 
rats were deeply anesthetized with 20% dorminal and 
perfused intracardially with normal saline followed by 4% 
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH 7.4). The brain 
and the spinal cord around the lesion site were dissected 
out, immersion-fixed in the same fixative overnight, and 
then placed in 30% sucrose in 0.1 mol/L PBS overnight. 
Transverse, 30-µm serial sections of the brain and cord 
were cut on a Leica cryotome (Ontario, Canada). 
Immunohistochemistry
Neurofilament immunohistochemistry was performed 
to study the secondary damage around the lesion site 
after transection using a rabbit polyclonal antibody 
against neurofilament 200 (NF200) (1:3 000, Chemicon 
International, Temecula, CA). Following incubation with 
the primary antibody, the sections were reacted with their 
Qiuju Yuan, et al.    Secondary degeneration after SCI 511
corresponding Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody 
(1:400, Molecular Probes, New York, NY) and then 
visualized under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope (Berlin, 
Germany). 
Statistical Analysis 
The data on the BBB scale are expressed as mean ± SEM. 
Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA 
using GraphPad Prism (Version 4.0, San Diego, CA). 
Statistical significance was set at P <0.05.
RESULTS
Age-dependent Hindlimb Locomotor Performance
Similar to intact rats, those transected at PN1 and PN7 
showed plantar placement that their paws rested flat on the 
ground, but had no weight support (Fig. 1A–C). However, 
rats transected at PN14 and as adults never showed paw 
placement with weight support; the dorsal paw surface 
faced the ground (Fig. 1D, E). The BBB scores of the 
rats transected at PN1 and PN7 ranged from 8 to 10 
(Fig. 1F). These rats were able to move their hindlimbs 
to some extent, and stepped with or without weight 
support (Supplemental Video 1), although their locomotor 
performance did not approximate that of intact rats, which 
showed consistent plantar stepping, a coordinated gait and 
consistent trunk stability (Supplemental Video 2). However, 
the BBB scores of the rats transected at PN14 and as 
adults were from 0 to 1. Most of these rats had complete 
paralysis and could not move their hindlimbs. Some of 
them showed slight movement of one or two hindlimb 
joints, but never showed weight-supported steps (Fig. 1F, 
Supplemental Video 3). 
Age-dependent Secondary Degeneration in Spinal Cord 
around the Lesion Site 
At the end of the 2-month survival time, the spinal cords 
of all animals were collected for gross examination. In the 
intact group, the surface of the cord was smooth. In the 
PN14 and adult groups, scar tissue was observed at the 
transection site. However, in the PN1 and PN7 rats, an 
opaque white tissue was found; this was repaired dura 
matter and connective tissue between the spinal stumps. 
Significant atrophy of the spinal cord stumps around the 
lesion site was present in animals transected at PN1 and 
PN7. To further investigate the secondary degeneration 
around the lesion site, NF200 immunohistochemistry was 
performed[19]. In rats transected at PN14 and as adults, a 
large number of fibers was found around the lesion site 
from 5.0 mm rostrally to 5.0 mm caudally, including the 
lesion site although they were fewer than those in intact

fibers around the lesion site from 2.5 mm rostrally to 2.5 
mm caudally in rats transected at PN1 and PN7, although 
the neurofilament-immunoreactivity was seen at 5 mm 
rostrally and caudally (Fig. 2B–F). The quantitative data 
also showed a >5-mm gap at the lesion site (7.5 ± 0.9 mm 
for PN1; 6.0 ± 0.5 mm for PN7), and white/gray matter 
was formed at both stumps two months after complete 
transection at PN1 and PN7.  
FluoroGold Did Not Cross the Transection Site to 
Reach Specific Regions of the Brain in Any Age Group
Fluorescence imaging of the brain for FG revealed robust 
staining of neurons in the sensorimotor cortex of the 
hindlimb area and red nucleus in the intact rats (Fig. 3A, B). 
In contrast, the same brain regions in the rats transected 
at PN1, PN7, PN14, and as adults showed no FG staining, 
indicating that no reconnection occurred across the initial 
transection site at any age.
Re-transection Caudal to the Original Transection Site 
Causes No Apparent Loss in Locomotor Performance 
in Rats Transected at PN1 
Before re-transection, rats transected at PN1 showed 
plantar placement that the paws rested flat on the ground 
with weight support (Fig. 4A, A’). After re-transection, the 
rats also showed plantar placement and weight support (Fig. 
4B, B’). The BBB scores before and after re-transection 
of PN1 rats were both from 8 to 10, with no significant 
difference (Fig. 4C). Besides, the re-transection caused 
no apparent loss in the locomotor performance of rats 
transected on PN1 (Supplemental Videos 1 and 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated whether there is a link 
between the recovery of  locomotor funct ion and 
regeneration after complete spinal cord transection at 
PN1, PN7, PN14 and in adult rats. In good agreement with 
previous studies[1-4], the rats transected at PN1 and PN7 
showed a significant level of functional locomotor recovery 
on the BBB scale, in contrast to those transected at 
PN14 and in adulthood, which failed to recover. However, 
thorough anatomical investigations showed no signs of 
regeneration through the lesion site in PN1 and PN7 rats. 
First, our histological studies of the retrograde transport 
of FG showed no signs of regeneration in the transected 
PN1 and PN7, just as in the PN14 and adult rats. Second, 
the PN1 rats showed similar locomotor functions before 
and after spinal re-transection. And third, we unexpectedly 
found age-dependent secondary degeneration around the 
lesion site. Unlike that of the rats transected at PN14 and in 
adulthood, the spinal cord of PN1 and PN7 rats underwent 
massive secondary degeneration around the lesion site,

leaving a >5-mm gap between the two stumps, where no 
fibers were revealed by neurofilament immunostaining. 
The secondary degeneration following spinal cord injury 
(SCI) was age-dependent. It is known that SCI results 
in immediate damage followed by a secondary phase of 
tissue damage. The secondary injury mechanisms include, 
but are not limited to, glutamate excitotoxicity, ischemia, 
inflammation, free radical-induced cell death, and the 
induction of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways[20]. 
We suggest that the massive secondary degeneration in 
the rats transected at PN1 and PN7 may be due to the 
vulnerability of the injured immature spinal cord to the 
above factors. Studies involving traumatic brain injury in 
developing rats lend support to this suggestion[21, 22]. Bittigau 
et al. found that the severity of trauma-triggered damage in 
the rat brain is age-dependent, the immature brain being 
exceedingly vulnerable to excitotoxicity[21].
Taken together, these three lines of evidence clearly 
demonstrated that the improvements in locomotor 
performance of rats transected at PN1 and PN7 were

not attributable to supraspinal input. Our results strongly 
support the hypothesis that the recovery of locomotor 
funct ion in developing rats depends only on the 
lumbosacral circuitry below the lesion rather than the 
regrowth of spinal tracts across the lesion site. The fact 
that the spontaneous recovery of motor function in the 
developing rat was not due to the re-establishment of brain-
spinal cord connectivity is in conflict with the conventional 
concept that one necessary element of the recovery of 
locomotor function in post-traumatic spinal cord is long-
tract axonal regeneration [reviewed by[23]]. The present 
data together with previous studies[3,15] provide a new 
insight into the basic mechanisms of the neural control of 
locomotion. In fact, conventional locomotor network theory 
in which locomotor function needs supraspinal input has 
been challenged in human studies, which showed that 
adequate electrical stimulation of the lumbar segments 
can induce locomotor movements in complete SCI[24]. In 
order to identify specific areas that are responsible for 
the recovery of locomotor function in cases of traumatic 
lesions to the spinal cord, it is necessary to gain further 
insights into this issue in animal models. The transected 
spinal cord of neonatal rats may provide an excellent 
model in which to identify the locomotor networks. 
CONCLUSION
It is widely accepted that neonatal rats receiving a 
complete spinal cord transection spontaneously recover a 
significant level of locomotor performance[1, 3, 4]. However, 
no general agreement has been reached on whether this 
recovery is due to regeneration across the lesion site of 
transected axons. Our data provide new solid evidence 
of the occurrence of massive secondary degeneration 
around the lesion site in the developing rat, together with 
anatomical evidence from retrograde labeling and re-
transection experiments, and support the notion that the 
spontaneous recovery of locomotor function in neonates is 
not necessarily attributable to regeneration.
