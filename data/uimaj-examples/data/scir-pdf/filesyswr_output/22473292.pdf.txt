Mice deficient in the recognition molecules, close homolog
of L1 (CHL1) and tenascin-C, show improved and reduced
functional recovery, respectively, after spinal cord injury
compared with wild-type littermates. In this study, we
addressed the question whether the differential functional
outcome was paralleled by differences in blood–spinal
cord barrier (BSCB) repair in the two mouse strains. We
conducted spinal cord compression injuries in knock-out
and wild-type mice. BSCB permeability was assessed by
measuring the Evans blue spread within the spinal cord
tissue at 14–21 days after injury. Results show that CHL1
reduces and tenascin-C enhances BSCB permeability,
suggesting a correlation between functional outcome and
BSCB repair. NeuroReport 23:479–482 c 2012 Wolters

Introduction
The blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) is a diffusion
barrier that is integral in the central nervous system
(CNS) as it regulates and restricts the transport of
molecules and cells into and out of the spinal cord. Spinal
cord injury (SCI) results in primary and secondary tissue
damage and cellular responses after injuries. The primary
responses refer to the mechanical damage that directly
leads to BSCB breakdown, bleeding, cell death, destruc-
tion of essential neural structures, such as axons and
myelin, as well as activation of central and peripheral glia
and of the immune system, including the infiltration of
neutrophils and macrophages [1]. Secondary responses
include continued disruption of the BSCB and sustained
inflammatory responses and astrogliosis. These responses
greatly affect the degree of functional recovery [2].
The activation of astrocytes after SCI is of particular
importance for repair of the BSCB [1]. Activated astro-
cytes upregulate the expression of various cell surface
molecules including cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and
extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins. Among these
astrocyte-associated molecules are the CAM close homo-
log of L1 (CHL1) [3,4] and the ECM glycoprotein
tenascin-C (TNC) [5,6]. As the two molecules have been
implicated in evoking both conducive and repellent actions
on neuronal cell bodies and neurites in vitro [7,8], we
previously analyzed their functional roles in repair of the
injured spinal cord using mice constitutively deficient in
these molecules through genetic knock out. CHL1-
deficient (CHL1 – / – ) mice showed better locomotor
recovery and axonal regeneration after SCI due to the
lack of CHL1 expression in astrocytes and the resulting
block of CHL1 homophilic binding mechanisms inhibit-
ing axonal growth [4]. In contrast to CHL1 – / – mice, mice
constitutively ablated in TNC (TNC – / – mice) expression
recover less well than their wild-type (TNC+ /+ ) litter-
mates after SCI [9]. On the basis of these observations
we were interested to analyze whether we could correlate
an abnormal BSCB repair, different between the two
mutants, with the distinct and opposite outcomes in
recovery from SCI. Here we show that, compared with
wild-type littermates, BSCB permeability is decreased in
CHL1 – / – mice and increased in TNC – / – mice with SCI.
These findings suggest that CHL1 and TNC have differ-
ential impacts on BSCB repair correlating with different
outcomes after SCI.
Materials and methods
Animals
Ten CHL1 – / – and nine CHL1+ /+ mice, and 10 TNC – / –
and 10 TNC+ /+ mice were obtained from heterozygous
breeding pairs with a mixed C57BL/6J-129Ola genetic
background and five backcrosses into C57BL/6J [10,11].
Mice at the age of 77–130 days were used. Genotypes
were determined by PCR analysis. For the experiments
with CHL1 – / – and CHL1+ /+ mice, only females were
used. For the experiments with TNC – / – and TNC+ /+
mice, both males and females were used after assuring
that there was no statistical difference in results between
sexes. Mice were kept under standard laboratory condi-
tions and taken care of by the animal services staff of the

Keck Center, Nelson Laboratories, Rutgers University, in
accordance with the guidelines of Rutgers University and
the National Institutes of Health. All experiments as well
as data acquisition and analyses were performed in a
blinded manner.
Spinal cord injury
Mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injec-
tions of ketamine and xylazine (100 and 5mg/kg body
weight, respectively, both from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
Missouri, USA). The mice were then left on a 351C
heating pad for 20min before surgery. Laminectomy was
carried out at the T8–T10 level to expose the spinal cord
using mouse laminectomy forceps (Fine Science Tools,
Foster City, California, USA). The spinal cord was
compressed for 1 s using a watchmaker forceps (Fine
Scientific Tools) driven by an electromagnetic device to
produce severe SCI [12,13]. The skin was closed using a
3-0 silk suture (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey, USA).
All surgeries were performed using sterile technique. The
mice were kept on heating pads (351C) throughout the
surgery and the following 5–6 h or until they awoke.
During the postoperative period (14–21 days), mice were
singly caged in a temperature-controlled room (221C)
with water and food within reach [4]. Bladders were
manually voided twice daily.
Evans blue injection and measurement of spread in the
spinal cord
During the postoperative days, Evans blue (EB, E2129;
Sigma-Aldrich) was intravenously injected into the tail
vein at days 14, 18, and 21 after SCI. These time points
were chosen during a preliminary evaluation of changes
in BSCB permeability in our compression SCI model.
EB has the property to bind quantitatively to albumin
in vivo [14]. The EB/albumin complex leaks through the
disrupted BSCB into the tissue after SCI and is thus an
indicator of BSCB integrity [15]. The extent of extra-
vasation of the systemically applied EB (1% in saline,
1ml/100 g body weight) along the spinal cord axis served
as an estimate of BSCB integrity [16]. Twenty-four hours
after the injection, the mice were again deeply anesthe-
tized and transcardially perfused with 25ml of PBS, pH
7.3 for 10min at room temperature. Twenty-four hours
after injection was chosen as the time point for sacrifice
as at this time the plasma levels of EB decrease to
insignificant levels coinciding with the uptake of the EB/
albumin complex by astrocytes and microglia/macro-
phages for degradation [17].
Presence of EB was quantitatively assessed by measur-
ing the spread of EB along the spinal axis after expo-
sure of the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Images were
taken with a dissection microscope (Zeiss SteREO V8,
Jena, Germany), and the maximum spread of the dye
along the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord was mea-
sured using the Image J software (NIH, Bethesda,
Maryland, USA).
Statistical analysis
Data were collected in a blinded matter. Data were
analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with ‘genotype’ and ‘time’ as factors followed by the
multiple comparison procedure of Holm–Sidak. P values
of less than 0.05 were considered as significant.
Results
Measurements of the maximum rostrocaudal spread of EB
were performed at 14, 18, and 21 days after compression SCI
in CHL1–/– mice and their wild-type littermates and the

results showed overall higher values in CHL1+/+ compared
with CHL1–/– mice. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant
effects of ‘genotype’ (CHL1+/+ vs. CHL1–/– , Fig. 1a,
F1,12=27, P<0.001, respectively) and ‘time’ (F2,11=9.9,
P=0.003). No interaction between the two factors
(‘genotype’ ‘time’) was found (F2,12=0.9, P=0.432).
Pairwise multiple comparisons using the Holm–Sidak
method showed no changes over time (14–21 days) for
wild-type mice (CHL1+/+, P>0.05) but differences for
CHL1–/– mice (21 days<18 and 14 days, P<0.05). These
results indicate lower BSCB permeability in CHL1–/– mice
at 14–21 days after SCI and faster decline in this per-
meability over time in CHL1–/– compared with CHL1+/+
mice.
In contrast to CHL1 – / – mice, the mean spread of EB was
larger in TNC – / – than in TNC+ /+ mice at 14, 18, and 21
days after compression SCI (Fig. 1b). Statistically
significant effects were found for ‘genotype’ (TNC+ /+
vs. TNC – / – mice, F1,12= 72, P<0.001) and ‘time’
(F2,11= 9.7, P=0.004) (two-way ANOVA). In addition,
there was a significant interaction between these two
factors (F1,12= 5.0, P<0.001). Pair-wise multiple com-
parisons showed no changes over time for TNC+ /+ mice
(P>0.05, Holm–Sidak test) but differences for TNC – / –
mice (18 days<14 and 21 days, P<0.05). These results
indicate higher BSCB permeability in TNC– / – than in
TNC+/+ mice at 14–21 days after SCI and no decline in
this permeability over time.
We thus conclude that in the absence of the two
molecules during ontogenetic development and in the
adult, the BSCB is different from those of wild-type mice
and in opposite manners: the CHL1-/- mouse repairs
the broken BSCB more efficiently that its CHL1+ /+
littermate and the TNC-/- mouse repairs the BSCB bar-
rier less well than its TNC +/+ littermate. The results
imply that CHL1 impairs, while TNC enhances the
repair of the adult BSCB.
Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence that the CAM and
ECM proteins, CHL1 and TNC respectively, affect the
repair of the BSCB. Previous studies had demonstrated
that CHL1 – / – mice functionally recover more efficiently
after SCI compared with CHL1+ /+ mice and TNC – / –
mice functionally recover worse after SCI compared with
TNC+ /+ mice.
Choosing the appropriate time points was an important
decision as previous studies on blood–brain barrier repair
in the rat suggested that protein leakage into and around
the injured site was maximal between 3 h to 1 day [18]
with the barrier being re-established by 14 days. A study
by Popovich et al. [19] shows, however, that the time
course for leaking of molecules circulating in the blood
stream through the barrier varies from 4 to 28 days. It is
noteworthy in this context that the inflammatory response
to a traumatic injury, such as spinal cord compression, is
not the same as a wound inflicted to the cerebral cortex,
let alone comparing rats and mice. It has been reported
that the area and duration of increased membrane
permeability is much greater in the cord than in the
brain [20]. In our preliminary studies, we looked at the
wild-type mice at time points ranging from 1 to 28 days
after injury. One to 10 days after the injury, high con-
centrations of the dye had leaked into the spinal cord
tissue and could not be measured differentially and
precisely, whereas at B4 weeks, infiltration of dye was
minimal and not measurable. Therefore, the time range
of 2–3 weeks was selected as the appropriate times to
study the mouse BSCB repair.
The primary and secondary responses to tissue injury are
important for recovery after SCI. Of these responses,
particularly the activation of microglia/macrophages and
astrocytes affect the BSCB repair. TNC, a major ECM
molecule, is abundantly expressed in astrocytes, which
play important roles in BSCB functions [6]. Our previous
study showed that genetic deficiency in TNC inhibited
axonal outgrowth and locomotor recovery [9], whereas
deficiency in CHL1 prevents fibroblast growth factor-2-
mediated upregulation of the CHL1 expression in
astrocytes and inhibitory homophilic binding mechanisms
of CHL1 [4]. The present study shows a positive
correlation between closure of the BSCB and success in
regeneration, but it cannot deduce mechanisms by which
TNC and CHL1 affect BSCB repair. However, our study
draws attention to adhesion molecules in BSCB functions
and to a plausible connection between adhesion mole-
cules and tissue homeostasis affected by the BSCB.
It is important to note that inflammatory responses
following SCI, such as infiltration of macrophages and
other immune cells into the spinal cord, also affect BSCB
repair. The functions of CHL1 and TNC in the immune
system thus need to be studied, not only in CNS injury,
but also in other acute and chronic inflammatory
responses outside the CNS. Therefore, further studies
investigating the infiltration of the immune system cells
into the spinal cord of TNC – / – and CHL1 – / – mice after
SCI will be necessary. These studies should lead to
further insights into our understanding of the mechan-
isms by which TNC aids and CHL1 hinders the recovery
of spinal cord injured mammals.
Conclusion
In this study, we show a positive correlation between im-
proved locomotor recovery after SCI and improved repair
of the BSCB in CHL1 – / – and TNC+ /+ mice compared
with CHL1+ /+ and TNC – / – , respectively. This novel
evidence draws attention to adhesion molecules as
players in spinal cord regeneration in correlation with
BSCB repair and may lead to targets for therapy both at
the level of the spinal cord as well as of the BSCB.
