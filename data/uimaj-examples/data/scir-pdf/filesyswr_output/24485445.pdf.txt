PicoSpritzer (General Valve), which gen-
erates pulses of relatively high pressure
(in excess of 1,000 mm Hg). For com-
parison, human blood pressure typically
reaches a peak systolic pressure of
120 mm Hg. This high pressure would
tend to force cells from the lesion site
canal with direct access to the cere-
brospinal fluid. In contrast, humans typi-
cally have contusion-type injuries with
a closed lesion cavity surrounded by an
outer perimeter of white matter. We envi-
sion that cells would be injected into this
type of cavity, were this approach to be

Steward and colleagues report that
implants of E14 rat spinal-cord-derived
multipotent neural progenitor cells are
associated with ectopic deposits of
cells, occasionally at long distances
from a T3 spinal cord lesion and grafting
site. Of 20 grafted rats, half showed
ectopic cell deposits. One rat had a
deposit of cells in the 4th ventricle, from
which relatively few axons extended
into the tegmentum. Half of animals
had cells within six spinal segments of
the lesion site, and of these, three had
deposits more distantly.
There is a long and well-established
precedent for the finding that neural
stem cells and other nervous system
cells can spread over extended distances
through the adult nervous system (Fricker
et al., 1999, Li et al., 2003, Han et al.,
2004, Guzman et al., 2007, Pearse
et al., 2007, Goldman et al., 2012). Previ-
ous reports have also specifically
documented spread of implanted cells
through the central canal and subpial re-
gion (Li et al., 2003, Pearse et al., 2007).
Re-examination of specimens from our
original report (Lu et al., 2012) confirms
that ectopic cell deposits were found in
three of six animals with complete tran-
sections. A few points should be noted
in interpreting findings specific to our
experiment and the letter of Steward
et al. (2014).
First, in our experiment and that of388 Cell 156, January 30, 2014 ª2014 ElsevieCo

our grafting technique into C7 spinal
cord lesion sites uses a low pressure
grafting method and ectopic cell
deposits have not been detected in any
of six monkeys as of this date (E.S.
Rosenzweig, et al., 2013, Soc. Neurosci.
abstracts).
Second, in moving from rat to primate
studies, we have increased the concen-
trations of fibrinogen and thrombin in the
grafting mixture, resulting in more rapid
gelling and lower potential risk of cells
escaping from the lesion site.
Third, humans have a ‘‘vestigial’’ cen-
tral canal that becomes functionally
closed in most individuals by the second
decade of life (Milhorat et al., 1994).
Thus, the risk of cell spread through
this cavity may be reduced in humans.
However, humans with posttraumatic
syrinx formation might be at greater risk
of remote cell migration through a patent
central canal.
Fourth, these were syngeneic grafts of
E14 spinal cord donor tissue, analogous
from an immunologic perspective to cell
autografts in humans. Systematic study
of migratory properties of neural stem
cells or multipotent neural progenitor cells
from other donor cell types and across
outbred individuals is required to fully
appreciate whether cells will distribute
ectopically after grafting, particularly
when using human cells.
Fifth, cells in rats with complete tran-r Inc.numbers and over very long distances
through the injured adult spinal cord.
This suggests many fruitful avenues for
further investigation, including studies
focused on both mechanism and trans-
lation. Adequate safety and biodistribu-
tion studies should always be performed
prior to initiation of human clinical
trials using neural stem cells for any
indication.

Caution is prudent in generalizing
findings from a single cell type, a
single lesion model, and a unique
high-pressure injection system, to all
approaches that utilize neural stem cells.
