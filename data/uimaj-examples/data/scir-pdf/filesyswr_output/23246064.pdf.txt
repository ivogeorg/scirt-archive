cell, and cellematrix interaction, which are important regulating
signals to stem cells, cannot be well characterized by the two-
dimensional (2-D) in vitro culture [2]. The three-dimensional (3-
D) culture system bridges the gap between in vivo system and the
in vitro 2-D system.
In the central nervous system (CNS), neural progenitor cells
(NPCs) give rise to all kinds of types of neural cells. The fate of NPCs
is decided by the cooperation between extracellular cues and
intercellular factors [3]. A group of transcription factors with basic
neurogenesis prematurely during development [6]. In the sub-
ventrical zone of adult brain, high level of Id1 expression was
necessary for the self-renewal of Type B1 neural progenitor cells
[7]. Hes proteins, which were highly expressed in NPCs, maintained
the self-renewal property of NPCs by inhibiting neuronal differ-
entiation [8,9].
In additional to intercellular factors, the differentiation and self-
renewal of NPCs are also under control of extracellular signals.

regulating NPCs differentiation. Our subsequent experiments
further discovered that in the 2-D in vitro culture the inhibition of
mTOR by rapamycin could improve the self-renewal of NPCs
(Fig. S1).
The 3-D culture of NPCs is getting more attention. However, the
mechanisms that control the differentiation and self-renewal of 3-
D cultured NPCs remained largely uncharacterized. In this study,
through comparing NPCs cultured on 2-D plates and in 3-D
collagen scaffolds, the differentiation and self-renewal characters
of NPCs were analyzed. To profoundly understand the behavior of
NPCs 3-D culture, the signal mechanisms directing NPC differen-
tiation and self-renewal in 3-D culture was further investigated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Scaffolds preparation
The 3-D collagen scaffolds were made from bovine collagen of spongy bone as
described previously [26]. Briefly, the spongy bones were separated from the head of
a long bone, cut into appropriate size, and soaked in acetone for 48 h. After removing
the fatty composition by acetone, the samples were washed by ddH2O completely.
Then, the samples were demineralized by 0.6 M HCl following enzyme treatment
and ddH2O washing. Finally the 3-D collagen scaffolds were obtained from freeze-
drying approach. In this study, the scaffolds were further cut into
1 mm  5 mm  5 mm cubes for NPCs growth.
2.2. Neural progenitor cells culture
NPCs isolationwas referred to the previous procedurewith slightly modification
[25]. Briefly, the telecephalons were dissected from neonatal SpragueeDawley rats.
Then tissues were cut into 1 mm3 pieces and removed to 0.25% trypsin, incubated at
37 C for 40 min. Trypsin inhibitor was added to stop the digestion, and the sample
was centrifuged for 5 min at 250 g. The remained pellet were resuspended in
neurosphere medium which contains 20 ng/mL bFGF (Peprotech Asia, Rehovot,
Israel), 20 ng/mL EGF (Peprotech Asia), 2% B27 (Invitrogen, GIBCO, NY, USA), 30%
glucose (Sigma, MO, USA), and 1.83 mg/mL heprin (H3149, Sigma) dissolved in
DMEM-F12 1:1 medium (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded to T25 flask (Corning, NY,
USA) at the density of 200 cells/mL and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2. At the 4th
day, neurospheres were collected by centrifugation at 250 g, then the pellets were
suspended in fresh neurosphere medium. At the 7th day, the neurospheres were
collected and digested in 0.25% trypsin for 15e20 min at room temperature. NPCs
were resuspended in adhesion medium which contains 10% FBS (Invitrogen) in
DMEMmedium (Invitrogen). NPCs were then seeded onto 60 mm dishes and 6-well
plates precoated with poly-D-lysine (PDL) or type I collagen for 2-D culture and
seeded into 3-D collagen scaffolds for 3-D cultured. In detail, NPCs were plated at the
density of 8e15  104 cells/cm2 for 2-D culture. For 3-D culture, the scaffolds were
sterilized by gamma ray radiation, and soaked in DMEM medium overnight. Then
the filter paper was used to absorb the excessivemedium of scaffolds. 2106 cells in
50e80 mL adhesion medium were absorbed by the scaffolds. Subsequently, the
scaffolds were incubated at 37 C for 4 h to allow cells to attach onto the inner
surface of the scaffolds, and new adhesion medium was added for further
incubation.
After 24 h adhesion, the adhesion medium was change by differentiation
medium containing 2% B27 and 30% glucose in DMEM-F12 1:1 medium. Cells were
collected at the indicated time for different assays. For detecting the phosphoryla-
tion of p70S6K, rapamycin (Sigma) was pretreated for 2 h.
2.3. Western blotting
NPCs were digested by trypsin from 2-D and 3-D culture systems, and the
trypsin inhibitor was used to terminate the digestion. The collected cells were
washed by phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Thermo, Hyclone, UT, USA) for 2 times,
and lysed by RIPA buffer (Sigma) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor cocktail
(04693116001, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 min on ice. The
whole-cell lysates were harvested from the supernatant of centrifugation 14,000 g
for 30 min. BCA assay was used to measure the protein concentration, and the
equivalent quantity protein lysates were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel,
and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE, Amershame, Buckinghamshire,
UK). The primary antibodies used in this study included: anti-Tuj1 (05-559, Milli-
pore, NY, USA), anti-GFAP (MAB360, Millipore), anti-a-tubulin (T5168, Sigma), anti-
phosphorylated-p70S6K (9204, Cell Signaling, MA, USA), anti-total-p70S6K (9202,
Cell Signaling), anti-GADPH (AB-P-R 001, Goodhere, Hangzhou, China), anti-REDD1

the HRP-linked-secondary antibodies including anti-mouse (SouthernBiotech,Alabama, USA) and anti-rabbit (Thermo, PIERCE) IgG antibodies were used accord-
ing to the corresponding primary antibody.
2.4. Scanning electron microscopy
3-D scaffolds with NPCs growing in it within 24 h and the 3-D collagen scaffolds
without NPCs werewashed by PBS for 3 times, and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde at 4 C
for 4 h. After washing in PBS for 3  10 min, the fixed scaffolds were dehydrated
through a graded ethanol series: 30%, 50%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95% for
10 min respectively, and 100% for 2  20 min. Ethanol was extracted in 3:1, 1:1, and
1:3 mixtures of ethanol and amyl acetate for 20 min each followed by 100% amyl
acetate storage. Then the samples were dried by super critical CO2 extraction, and
coated with gold. The images were captured by HITACHI S-3000N scanning electron
microscopy (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan).
2.5. RT-qPCR and RNA interfering
Total RNA was extracted by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from cells culture in 3-D
and 2-D conditions for the time indicated in the experiment. 1 mg total RNA reverse-
transcribed with Superscriptâ¢ (Invitrogen) after digested by DNaseâ  (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Quantitative real-time PCR was per-
formed by ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Life Tech-
nologies, CA, USA) and SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as instructions
described by manufactures. Briefly, 0.5 mL cDNA mixed with 0.5 mL primer mixture,
5 mLMasterMix and 4 mL distilled water were denatured at 95 C for 10min followed
by 40 cycles of PCR (95 C for 15 s, 60 C for 1 min). The sequences of the primers
were as follow: Hes1: forward 50 GCCGTGGCGGAACTGA 30 , backward 50
GAGGTGGGCTAGGGAGTTTATGA 30; Hes5: forward 50 CCGCATCAACAGCAGCATT 30 ,

GAACTTGTG 30 , backward 50 CCGGGTCAGTGGCAAAAAC 30; REDD1: forward 50
CGCTCTTGTCCGCAATCTTC 30 , backward 50 GGACGCTGGTTGATGAGGTT 30 . Relative
quantitation of the expression level was analyzed by using the 2â¿â¿Ct method. The
â¿Ct value was resulted from the normalization by b-actin Ct value, and the â¿â¿Ct
value was resulted from the normalization by the â¿Ct value of 2-D PDL group.
REDD1 RNA interfering was conducted by lentivirus, and the target sequence
was 50 AGGACTCCTCATACCTGGATG 30 [27]. The construction and envelope were
undertaken by Shanghai GenePharma Company (Shanghai, China). After adhered for
24 h, NPCs were infected by RNAi lentivirus (control or REDD1 RNAi) using MOI of 15
without polybrene. Incubating for 24 h at 37 C, lentivirus was absorbed and
replaced by fresh adhesion medium. After adhesion mediumwas incubated for 24 h,
medium was changed by differentiation medium. At 6 h after differentiation
medium changed, cells were collected for detection of REDD1 expression, p70S6K
phosphorylation and Id1 expression. Cells for colony formation assay were collected
at the 7th day after differentiation medium changed.
2.6. Colony formation assay
Colony formation assay of NPCs was mainly conducted as described previously
with slight modification [28]. Briefly, Cells cultured in 3-D and 2-D conditions for 7
days were digested to single cells and plated into 96-well plates at various cell
densities (0.1e10 cell/mL) in neurosphere medium. B27, EGF, and bFGF were
replenished every other day by adding appropriated quantity to thewell. Plateswere
scored for neurosphere blinded to each treatment using phase-contrast microscopy
at the 12th day. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the frequency of
colony formation.
2.7. Statistic analysis
Data represented the mean  s.d. Statistical differences between groups were
performed by ANOVA. Studentâs t test was performed to value the significance of
differences between means. * represented p value < 0.05, **p value < 0.01, and ***p
value < 0.001.
3. Results
3.1. Differentiation of NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds
The 3-D collagen scaffolds have a sponge-like shape (Fig. 1A).
The surfaces of 3-D collagen scaffolds were visualized by scanning
electronmicroscope (SEM). As shown in Fig. 1B, the pore size of 3-D
collagen scaffolds was 50e200 mm in diameter. It would provide
sufficient space for cells growing in the scaffolds. NPCs isolated
from the telencephalons of neonatal rats proliferated and formed
floating spheres in neurosphere medium containing growth factors

pre-coating with PDL or type I collagen and in 3-D collagen scaf-
folds. NPCs tended to aggregate with each other in 3-D collagen
scaffolds (Fig. 1C,D), but they spread out on 2-D plates within 24 h
upon attachment. (Fig. 1E,F). Once NPCs attached to 2-D plates and
3-D scaffolds, the mediumwas changed by differentiation medium,
which withdrew growth factors from neurosphere medium. The
differentiation potential of NPCs in 2-D and 3-D conditions was
inspected. After differentiating for 7 days, the expression of neuron
marker TUJ1 in 3-D collagen scaffolds was much lower than those
in 2-D culture. The TUJ1 expression was nearly the same on PDL-
coating and collagen-coating 2-D plates. At the same time, the
expression of glia marker GFAP in 3-D collagen scaffolds was

neuronal differentiation of NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds
decreased.
3.2. Expression of inhibitory bHLH factor
NPCs self-renewal and differentiation are controlled, to a large
part, by transcription factors with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
motifs [29]. The subset of neuro-active bHLH factors (neuroD,

important part in cell fate decision of NPCs. qPCR demonstrated
that Id1, Id3, Hes1 and Hes5 were expressed at a higher level in 3-D
collagen scaffolds than those in 2-D conditions (Fig. 2). Id and Hes
belong to inhibitory bHLH factors, which undertake the self-
renewal maintenance of NPCs [6,9,30,31]. Thus, the high level
expressions of inhibitory bHLH factors may explain the phenom-
enon that the differentiation of NPCs in 3-D culture was decreased.
3.3. Secondary colony formation ability

renewal and inhibiting neuronal differentiation [6,9,30,31]. We

(Fig. 1G), and the expression of Id and Hes maintained at a high
level in NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds (Fig. 2). Next, we analyzed
the self-renewal abilities of NPCs cultured on 2-D plates and in 3-D
scaffolds. NPCs were digested to single cells after differentiating for
7 days in 2-D and 3-D culture, then plated at cell densities of 0.1-
5cells/mL in neurosphere medium with growth factors. NPCs
cultured in 3-D collagen scaffolds generated more colonies at all
densities than those in 2-D groups. There were no significant

differences in the abilities of generating secondary colonies
between NPCs differentiating on PDL-coating and collagen-coating
2-D plates (Fig. 3A). The linear regression was further used to
estimate the abundance of clonogenic cells in the total population
(Fig. 3B). In 3-D group, roughly one colony formed from every 28
cells or a frequency of 0.0355 colonies per cells plated (R2 Â¼ 0.98).
As to the NPCs cultured on collagen-coating 2-D culture plates, the
incidence dropped to 0.0079 (roughly one colony per 126.6 cells,
R2 Â¼ 0.99), and similar to PDL-coating 2-D culture plates, the
frequency of which stayed at 0.0106 or one colony per 94.8 cells
(R2 Â¼ 0.99). These results demonstrated that there are more
undifferentiated NPCs maintained in the 3-D collagen scaffolds.
3.4. Self-renewal maintenance by mTOR inactivation
Wehave found that 3-D culture in collagen scaffolds may help to
maintain the self-renewal status of NPCs. The mechanism was
investigated.We have previously discovered that the inactivation of
mTOR signal supported the self-renewal maintenance of NPCs ([25]
and Fig. S1). In this experiment, the phosphorylation of mTOR
reactor, p70S6K, was lower in 3-D culture than those in 2-D culture
(Fig. 4A). Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR signal, reduced the
phosphorylation of p70S6K of the three groups to the same low
level (Fig. 4B). Then we tested if rapamycin treatment could affect
the self-renewal status. In 3-D collagen scaffolds, Id1 protein
expressed lower than those in 2-D culture conditions (Fig. 4C),
(Fig. 4D). These results indicated that mTOR signal participated in
the self-renewal maintenance of NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds.
3.5. Up-regulation of REDD1 in 3-D-cultured NPCs
In numerous up-stream regulators of mTOR, growth factors gain
more attention. However, excess doses of insulin could not further
activate the phosphorylation of p70S6K of 3-D group (Fig. 5A). So
we hypothesized that there could be other up-stream signals pre-
venting the activation of mTOR. One of mTOR up-stream regula-
torsâREDD1 has been reported to mediate the differentiation and
development functions of mTOR [32,33]. In this study, REDD1
mRNA expression was found to be higher in 3-D group (Fig. 5B). At
the same time, western blotting results demonstrated the REDD1
protein level was also higher in 3-D group than those in 2-D groups
(Fig. 5C).
3.6. Self-renewal maintenance by REDD1 high expression
We further examined whether the inactivation of mTOR signal
in 3-D collagen scaffolds was caused by the high expression of
REDD1. As shown in Fig. 6A, the REDD1 RNAi lentivirus effectively
repressed the expression of REDD1 (Fig. 6A). The silence of REDD1
released the repression of the p70S6K phosphorylation, and the
activation level reached to the similar level among the 2-D and 3-D
groups (Fig. 6B). The reduced Id1 protein expression was observed

expression rose to a common high level under the treatment of
rapamycin (Fig. 4C). As to the secondary colony formation assay,
cells were plated at the density of 4cells/mL. In the absent of rapa-
mycin, NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds formed 17.33  1.15 colonies,
and in 2-D culture yielded 8.50  1.09 colonies on collagen-coating
plates and 7.33  0.58 colonies on PDL-coating plates (Fig. 4D). In
the present of rapamycin, the number of colony formed of the 3-D,
2-D collagen and 2-D PDL group reached to a similar high level,
with 17.92  0.76, 18.17  0.38 and 16.58  0.76 respectively

was similar to those of the two 2-D groups (Fig. 6C). As to the colony

of colonies formed in 3-D group (3.25  0.50 colonies), resulting in
a similar colonies number among the 3-D and 2-D groups

NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds through activation of mTOR
pathway.
4. Discussions
The 3-D culture system provided cells with cellecell interaction,
cellematrix interaction and 3-D physical microenvironments close
to in vivo microenvironments. Thus, 3-D culture is a useful culture
system for researching the self-renewal and differentiation mech-
anisms of stem cells. In this study we have studied the properties of
NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds, and further elucidated the regula-
tory mechanism of NPC self-renewal and differentiation in 3-D
collagen scaffolds. REDD1-mTOR pathway was found to partici-
pate in regulating the self-renewal and differentiation of NPCs.
Collagen is the major class of insoluble fibrous protein in
extracellular matrix (ECM). As a natural material, collagen is well
developed for 3-D culture. NPCs derived from spinal cord cultured
on electrospun aligned collagen nanofibrous scaffolds exhibited
a strong proliferation [34,35]. It was also reported that collagen
hydrogel could promote the neurogenesis or gilogenesis of NPCs
[36,37]. However in our experiments, the fewer neuronal differ-
entiation (Fig. 1G), the higher expression of Hes and Id (Figs. 2 and
4C), and the higher level of clone formation efficiency (Fig. 3) all
indicated that the self-renewal of NPCs was maintained in the 3-D
collagen scaffolds. Unlike hydrogel, the collagen scaffolds in our
experiments were sponge-like scaffolds with an average pore size

enhanced the clone formation efficiency of 3-D and 2-D groups to a common level.34 (2013) 1921e1928 1925of 100 mm (Fig. 1B). NPCs culture in the collagen scaffold tended to
aggregate (Fig. 1C,D). The physical microenvironments offered by
our collagen scaffolds were also different from those offered by
hydrogel. These may act as a cause of the different behaviors of
NPCs in our 3-D collagen scaffolds.
We have previously found that mTOR play a role in the neuro-
genesis and self-renewal of NPCs in 2-D in vitro culture ([25]
Fig. S1). In this study, lower mTOR activity was proved to support
the high clone formation efficiency and higher Id protein expres-
sion of NPCs in 3-D collagen scaffolds (Fig. 4). These results sug-
gested that mTOR inhibition is also vital to the self-renewal of 3-D
cultured NPCs. We have found that the inactivation of mTOR was
attributed to REDD1 overexpression in 3-D culture. REDD1 was
initially identified as a stress-responsive gene. It blocked the acti-
vation of mTOR through the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/
TSC2) [38e40]. REDD1 elevation was also found to be essential to
neuron death in Parkinsonâs disease [27,41]. It was reported that
REDD1 protected dividing cells from apoptosis, but induced the
apoptosis of non-dividing cells, like neurons [42]. In our study, we
found higher expression of REDD1 in NPCs and few neurons
differentiated in 3-D culture (Figs. 1G and 5), but the total cell
number in 3-D scaffolds did not changed during the detected
period (Fig. S2). This suggested that the REDD1 overexpression may
not induced apoptosis of NPCs, but functions in the self-renewal of
NPCs.
Recently, REDD1 was found to play a role in the developmental
processes. Ellisen et al. found that during mouse embryonic
development, the expression pattern of REDD1 paralleled that of
70S6K in 3-D group was lower than those in 2-D groups. (B) rapamycin decreased the

plates. We further investigated the mechanisms controlling the
regu
rialsp63 which is essential to epithelial differentiation, and REDD1 was
upregulated by p63 [43]. REDD1 was necessary to retinoic acid
(RA)-induced myeloid differentiation, and REDD1 was upregulated
by RA [44]. REDD1 was also found to mediate the inhibition of
mTOR by Plzf during the stemnessmaintenance of SPCs, and REDD1
was upregulated by Plzf [32]. Moreover, during neural differentia-
tion, the involvement of REDD1 has been detected. In vivo, neuronal
differentiation and neuron migration were delayed by REDD1
overexpression [33]. In our study, REDD1 mediated the stemness
maintenance of 3-D cultured NPCs (Figs. 5 and 6), which further
confirmed that REDD1 functioned in developmental process.
However, the upstream regulators of REDD1 in regulating the self-
renewal of NPCs need further exploration.
As we all know, the differentiation and self-renewal of NPCs is
modulated by several signal pathways. mTOR pathway was newly
identified as an important participant in regulating the differenti-
ation and self-renewal of NPCs. In general, mTOR is investigated as
an effecter of extracellular growth factor signals, especially insulin/
Fig. 7. The diagram of the vital position of mTOR in
J. Han et al. / BiomateIGF signals. Bateman et al. released that TOR functioned in the
temporal development of Drosophila under the control of insulin
receptor [22]. We have previously reported mTORâs respond to
insulin stimulation supported the neuronal differentiation of 2-D-
cultured NPCs [25]. In 3-D culture, a negative regulator of mTOR,
REDD1 was identified to support the mTOR inactivation and self-
renewal of NPCs (Figs. 5 and 6). From these results, we speculated
that mTOR underwent dual regulation in controlling the self-
renewal and differentiation of NPCs. Insulin and other growth
factors induced mTOR activity and functioned as a positive regu-
lator to differentiation and as a negative regulator to self-renewal.
REDD1, depressing mTOR activity, functioned just opposite to
growth factors (Fig. 7). As to the profound mechanisms, which
signals take charge of or interact with REDD1-mTOR signal to
maintain the self-renewal statement of NPCs, need to be further
investigated.
5. Conclusion
NPCs were cultured in 3-D collagen scaffolds and on 2-D PDL-
and collagen-coating plates. We have found that the neuronal
differentiation of NPCs cultured in 3-D scaffolds was decreased
compared with those cultured on 2-D plating. In the differentiation
medium, NPCs cultured in 3-D scaffolds maintained higherAcknowledgments
