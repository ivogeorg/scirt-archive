Abstract: Nerve regeneration after spinal cord injuries (SCI)
remains suboptimal despite recent advances in the field. One
major hurdle is the rapid clearance of drugs from the injury
site, which greatly limits therapeutic outcomes. Nanofiber
scaffolds represent a potential class of materials for enhancing
nerve regeneration because of its biomimicking architecture.
In this study, we investigated the feasibility of incorporating
neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) onto
electrospun collagen nanofibers for SCI treatment. By using
microbial transglutaminase (mTG) mediated crosslinking, pro-
teins were loaded onto electrospun collagen nanofibers at an
efficiency of 45–48%. By combining NT-3 with heparin during
the protein incorporation process, a sustained release of NT-3
was obtained (96% by day 28). As indicated by dorsal root
ganglion outgrowth assay, NT-3 incorporated collagen scaf-
folds supported neuronal culture and neurite outgrowth for a
longer time period than bolus delivery of NT-3. The presence
of heparin also protected ChABC from degradation. Specifi-
cally, as evaluated by dimethylmethylene blue assay, bioactive
ChABC was detected from collagen scaffolds for at least
32 days in vitro in the presence of heparin (32% of bioactiv-
ity retained). In contrast, ChABC bioactivity was only 1.9% by
day 22 in the absence of heparin. Taken together, these results
clearly demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating NT-3 and
ChABC via mTG immobilization to produce protein-
incorporated collagen nanofibers. Such biofunctional nano-
fiber constructs may find useful applications in SCI treatment
by providing topographical signals and multiple biochemical
cues that can promote nerve regeneration while antagonizing
axonal growth inhibition for CNS regeneration. VC 2011 Wiley

INTRODUCTION
Nerve regeneration following spinal cord injuries (SCI) is
often restricted by many growth inhibitory factors that pre-
vent neurons and support cells from infiltrating the injury
site. Chief among which, is the formation of glial scar follow-
ing injuries.1 One of the major components of the glial scar
is chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs).2–4 Correspond-
ingly, the delivery of chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) to digest
the neuronal growth inhibitory glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
side chains of CSPGs has been attempted with some suc-
cess.5,6 At present, ChABC treatment for SCI is mainly
achieved by intrathecal injection with frequencies ranging
from days to weeks and the typical duration lasting 2–6
weeks.7,8 Unfortunately, ChABC is thermal sensitive and
easily degraded by the host. Furthermore, the diffusion of
ChABC into the injury site is often limited because of over-
flow beyond the intrathecal space.6,9 Therefore, in order to
achieve desirable therapeutic outcomes, a slow-release
system that delivers ChABC locally is needed to maintain
sufficient levels of bioactive enzyme at the injury site over
prolonged time periods.
Therapeutic delivery of neurotrophins, such as neurotro-
phin-3 (NT-3), has also been attempted to promote the
sprouting, survival, and regrowth of corticospinal tracts.10,11
In most cases, direct injection of the drugs12 or controlled
delivery using hydrogels was used.13 The combinatory treat-
ment with ChABC and NT-3 in a sustained release manner
from hydrogels has also showed significantly improved loco-
motor function and enhanced growth of sensory axons in
rats.14 Unfortunately, hydrogels are typically isotropic in
nature and lack topographical features that may provide
contact guidance to enhance nerve regeneration.
Nanofibers scaffolds serve as ideal biomimetic substrates
because of their unique architecture that closely mimics the

structure of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM).15 Nano-
fiber topography enhanced the maturation of human Schwann
cells.15 Endowed with glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor,
sciatic nerve regeneration was enhanced.16 Applied to neural
tissue engineering in the central nervous system (CNS), elec-
trospun collagen nanofibers decreased astrocyte proliferation
and enhanced apoptosis without altering cellular activation as
compared to two-dimensional flat surfaces. In addition, when
implanted into a rat hemisection SCI model as spiral nerve
conduits, GFAPþ glial cell penetration was reduced and neuro-
filament sprouting was observed within the collagen scaffolds
as early as 10 days postimplantation.17
In this study, we introduced a method to incorporate
NT-3 and ChABC onto electrospun collagen nanofibers for
sustained protein delivery to treat SCI. The electrospinning
of collagen has been reported extensively.18–20 However, the
incorporation of drugs, particularly proteins, into electro-
spun collagen constructs remains unexplored. We hypothe-
sized that the synergistic effects of topographical cues and
multiple biochemical signals from a single construct would
provide a potential therapy for SCI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Type I collagen was extracted from rat tails for electrospin-
ning.21 Ninety-nine percent acetic acid was purchased from
MERCK. Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM), mini-
mum essential medium (MEM), Neurobasal medium, B27,
L-Glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, anti-Tuj1 primary anti-
body, secondary antibodies, bovine serum albumin Alexa
fluor 647 conjugates (BSA-647), and type I collagenase
were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum (FBS)
was purchased from Hyclone. Microbial transglutaminase
(mTG) was kindly provided by Ajinomoto. Neurotrophin-3
(NT-3) and Duoset Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits were ordered from R&D system. All other
chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Fabrication and crosslinking of electrospun collagen
scaffolds
Collagen nanofibers were electrospun as described previ-
ously.18 Randomly oriented collagen fibers were collected
on aluminum foils that were mounted on a grounded rotat-
ing target (150 rpm). Thereafter, all samples were photo-
chemically crosslinked as described previously.18 Stabilized
collagen scaffolds were then soaked in deionized water at
37C overnight to remove chemical residues. Following that,
the scaffolds were freeze-dried and UV sterilized for 15 min
on each side prior to further analyses.
Optimization of mTG mediated protein immobilization
BSA-647 was used as the model protein for optimization. To
elucidate the optimal initial loading amount of proteins, 1,
5, and 20 lg of BSA-647 were used. The protein samples
were each dissolved in 200 lL of PBS. Thereafter, each sam-
ple was added onto a collagen scaffold (10 mg/scaffold, n ¼
3 for each group), and placed on a shaker to ensure uniform
protein distribution. After 1 h, 300 lL of mTG Tris-buffer
solution (2 wt %) was added to each scaffold and incubated
at 37C for 2 h. Subsequently, the scaffolds were retrieved
and washed with PBS for three times before analysis.
To elucidate the optimal incubation time required for
mTG crosslinking, scaffolds comprising of an initial theoreti-
cal loading of 5 lg of BSA-647 were used. The BSA-647
loaded scaffolds were soaked in mTG solution for 2, 4, or
20 h (n ¼ 3 for each group). Thereafter, all samples were
retrieved and washed with PBS for three times prior to fur-
ther analyses.
To quantify protein loading efficiency, all BSA-647 incor-
porated scaffolds were digested by 1 mL of type I collage-
nase (10 mg/mL) at 37C. After 15 min, all scaffolds were
digested and 100 lL of sample was retrieved for fluores-
cence intensity measurement at 620 nm using a microplate
reader (TECAN Infinite 200). The amount of BSA-647 in
each sample was calculated based on a standard curve that
was generated through serial protein dilutions. The protein
loading efficiency was then calculated as:

NT-3 incorporation and in vitro release kinetics
Three electrospun collagen scaffolds (10 mg each) were pre-
pared for NT-3 incorporation studies. Firstly, 5 lg of NT-3 was
reconstituted in 100 lL of BSA solution (0.1 wt %). The result-
ing solution was then added into 100 lL of heparin (5 mg/mL
in PBS) to result in a final NT-3:heparin molar ratio of 800:1.
Heparin was used to protect the bioactivity of NT-322,23 and
the heparin to NT-3 ratio was chosen based on previous stud-
ies.24 Thereafter, NT-3/heparin solution was added onto the
collagen scaffolds and incubated on a shaker for 1 h at room
temperature to allow thorough protein distribution. Following
that, 300 lL of 2 wt% mTG solution was added and incubated
at 37C for 2 h. The NT-3 loaded collagen scaffolds were then
washed with PBS for three times and soaked in 1.5 mL of se-
rum-free neurobasal medium. Antibiotic-antimycotic solution
was added at a dilution of 1:100 and the fibers were incubated
under static conditions at 37C. At various time points, 1.2 mL
of supernatant was retrieved from each sample and an equal
volume of fresh medium was replaced. The concentration of
NT-3 in the supernatant was determined by ELISA assay and
1.0 mL of the supernatant was used for bioactivity studies. At
day 60, the fibers were digested in 1.0 mL of type I collagenase
(10 mg/mL) and any residual NT-3 was quantified by ELISA.
NT-3 bioactivity assay
Dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) were dissected from E15 old
embryos of Sprague Dawley rats under current Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. All
explants were then cultured in a humidified incubator at
37C with 5% CO2.
Supernatant assay. Isolated DRGs were seeded onto glass
cover slips coated with 1 mL of 0.1% poly-lysine in a

24-well plate (n ¼ 3). Thereafter, 1.0 mL of NT-3 superna-
tant was added. On the basis of our initial studies, at least
40 ng/mL of NT-3 was required for observable neurite out-
growth. Therefore, the positive control comprised of DRGs
cultured in the presence of 40 ng/mL of NT-3 while the
negative control comprised of DRGs cultured in plain neuro-
basal medium only. For all samples, 0.5 mM of L-glutamine
and 1% B-27 were added as supplements. After two days of
culture, the samples were examined under a bright-field
microscope (Olympus IX 71) at 10 magnification.
Scaffold-based assay. After washing NT-3 loaded scaffolds
for three times in PBS, 4–6 DRG explants were seeded directly
onto each scaffold (n ¼ 3) in a 24-well plate. The DRGs were
cultured in 1.0 mL of neurobasal medium supplemented with
0.5 mM L-glutamine, 1% B-27, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
The positive control comprised of DRGs that were seeded on
plain electrospun collagen scaffolds in the presence of 40 ng/
mL of fresh NT-3. A negative control comprised of DRGs cul-
tured on plain collagen scaffolds in the absence of NT-3. After
2 days of culture, all samples were fixed with 10% formalin
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. After
thorough washes with PBS, the scaffolds were blocked with
3% BSA. Primary antibody against Tuj-1 (1:500) was added
and incubated for 1 h. Thereafter, secondary antibody (Alexa
Fluor 633, 1:500) was added and incubated for 30 min. All
incubation was carried out at room temperature and all sam-
ples were washed three times with PBS in between each step.
The samples were then imaged under a confocal microscope
(Zeiss, LSM 710) and analyzed using the Image J software
(NIH). The average length of each neurite extension was
defined as the linear distance from the point of exit to the end
of the longest branch of that neurite. Length measurements of
18 neurites were taken from each explant and 9 explants were
measured for each group following previous protocol.25
ChABC sustained release and bioactivity assay
Collagen scaffolds (10 mg/scaffold, n ¼ 3 for each group) were
either soaked in ChABC only (denoted as Incorporated ChABC)
or ChABC/heparin solution (denoted as Incorporated ChABC/
heparin). The former comprised of scaffolds being incubated
with 200 lL of ChABC solution (200 mU of ChABC in PBS)
while the latter comprised of 200 lL of ChABC/heparin solu-
tion (200 mU of ChABC and 150 lg of heparin in PBS to result
in a heparin: ChABC ratio of 60 lmol:1U, which was chosen
based on previous study26). The mTG-mediated protein incor-
poration protocol described earlier was utilized. Thereafter, all
scaffolds were washed with PBS for three times prior to incu-
bation in 1 mL of PBS. As a control, 200 mU of fresh ChABC
was added directly into 1 mL of PBS (denoted as Soluble
ChABC). Finally, all samples were incubated at 37C.
At various time points, 10 lL of supernatant was col-
lected from each sample to react with 10 lL of decorin (0.5
mg/mL, a small molecular CSPG) at 37C. The enzymatic
digestion of decorin was then allowed to proceed for 2 h. A
DMMB assay was then used to quantify the sulfated glycos-
aminoglycan (CS-GAGs) that have been digested by ChABC.
According to previously reported protocol,27 180 lL of
DMMB reagent was added into 20 lL of reaction sample
and the absorbance was recorded at 530 nm. The absorb-
ance of the ChABC supernatant without decorin was used as
the background control. The absorbance of 5 lg of intact
decorin was considered as standard, 100% intact decorin.
Finally, the percentage of sample absorbance relative to the
standard was calculated, and the graphs of the percentage
of decorin digested by ChABC samples were plotted.
Statistic analysis
All data presented in this study are expressed as mean 6
standard error of mean (SE). For the analyses of BSA-647
loading efficiency, one-way ANOVA was used. Independent-
samples t-test was used for analyzing the difference of DRG
neurite length in different groups.

were used, the loading efficiencies were 48.4 6 0.47% and
45.32 6 2.27%, respectively with no significant difference
[Fig. 1(a)]. However, a significant decrease in loading effi-
ciency was observed when 20 lg of proteins were used. In
the case of mTG incubation time, no significant difference in
protein loading efficiency was observed [Fig. 1(b)]. Taken
together, 5 lg of initial protein mass and 2 h of incubation
in mTG were taken as the optimal parameters for subse-
quent NT-3 and ChABC incorporation studies.
NT-3 in vitro release kinetics
As shown in Figure 2, after an initial burst release of 35.9
6 1.7% in day 1, a sustained release of NT-3 was obtained
for up to 28 days. A total of 72.5 6 3.1% of NT-3 was
released during the first 6 days. Thereafter, the rate of pro-
tein release decreased. At day 60, a total of 99.2 6 3.91%
NT-3 was released relative to the total amount of NT-3
incorporated.
NT-3 bioactivity assay
Supernatant assay. As shown in Figure 3, significant neu-
rite outgrowth was observed in the positive control and
from DRGs that were exposed to day 4 supernatant, indicat-
ing the retention of NT-3 bioactivity. In contrast, neurite
outgrowth was very limited in the negative control. Compa-
ratively, DRGs exposed to NT-3 supernatant possessed neu-
rites that extended over shorter distances than the positive
control [Fig. 3(d), p < 0.01]. DRGs exposed to supernatants
collected after day 4 did not show obvious neurite
outgrowth.
Scaffold-based assay. As indicated in Figure 4(a,b), DRG
neurites emanated radially on NT-3 loaded collagen scaffolds
and the positive control. Quantitative measurements showed
that the lengths of the neurites were comparable in both
samples [Fig. 4(d)]. In contrast, no neurite outgrowth was
observed in the negative control [Fig. 4(c)]. At day 4, neurite
extensions remained prominent in DRGs that were seeded
on NT-3 loaded collagen scaffolds. However, such neurite
extension was absent in positive control [Fig. 4(d,e)].

ChABC bioactivity assay
As shown in Figure 5, sustained release of bioactive ChABC
with a gradual decrease in enzymatic activity was obtained
for at least 32 days in Incorporated ChABC/heparin sam-
ples. At day 32, the enzymatic activity of ChABC was
32.34 6 2.61% as compared day 1 (66.5 6 0.91%). In com-
parison, the enzymatic activities were 1.92 6 0.95% and
3.5 6 3.85% for Incorporated ChABC and Soluble ChABC
groups by day 22 and 15, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The rapid clearance of drugs from the spinal cord remains a
major hurdle to achieving effective therapeutic outcomes in
SCI treatment.14 As a result, various drug-delivery systems,
particularly hydrogels, have been developed to facilitate the
sustained and localized delivery of biomolecules such as
NT-3 and ChABC.14,24,28–30 Unfortunately, most of these plat-
forms are isotropic and lack nanoscaled topographical
cues14,24,26 that may be helpful in manipulating the inhibi-
tory microenvironment postSCI and directing regenerated
axons towards their appropriate targets. Our previous
results demonstrated the potential of plain electrospun col-
lagen nanofibers for SCI treatment.17 Therefore, in this
study, we chose to enhance the functionality of these
constructs by protein incorporation to provide synergistic
topographical and biochemical cues to enhance nerve regen-
eration in the CNS.

Transglutaminases (TGase) are a group of structurally
and functionally related enzymes that are distributed in
various organisms.31,32 TGase mediated crosslinking is
nontoxic, and is widely adopted in commercial food proc-
esses to improve the texture of protein-rich products.33,34
Gelatin and collagen are good substrates of TGase and mTG
has been used to modify the physical properties of these
materials.35,36 Theoretically, proteins can be covalently
immobilized onto collagen via mTG mediated acyl-transfer
reaction that occurs between the c-carboxamide groups of
glutamine residues in collagen and the e-amino groups of
lysine residues in proteins at temperatures 37C.37
The protein-incorporation optimization study indicated a
decrease in loading efficiency when 20 lg of protein was
used. This is likely due to the saturation of available binding
sites on collagen. When mTG crosslinking duration was
altered, the insignificant change in loading efficiency was
likely attributed to the rapid mTG crosslinking kinetics. The
fast rate of collagen-mTG crosslinking, occurring within
10 min, has been reported.37 Therefore, in order to ensure
that sufficient proteins were incorporated within reasonable
loading efficiency limits, 5 lg of NT-3 and ChABC with a
mTG incubation period of 2 h were chosen as the optimal
parameters.
As indicated in the release kinetics study, 72% of NT-3
was released within the first week. Thereafter, the release
rate decreased and resulted in 96% NT-3 release by day
28. Such a release profile is likely attributed to the degrada-
tion of the collagen scaffolds since previous in vitro studies
indicated 50% and 70% scaffold mass loss by days 7 and
15, respectively.18 The nonspecific adsorption and crosslink-
ing of heparin and NT-3 within our system may be another
contributing factor. Covalently immobilizing heparin onto
the nanofibers prior to absorbing NT-3 might provide better
control over protein release rate23 and will be explored in
future studies.
Compared to heparin-incorporated hydrogels (60%
NT-3 released by day 14 with 800:1 heparin to NT-3
ratio13,24), our collagen scaffolds enabled a quicker and
more efficient release of NT-3. Although, an initial burst
availability of NT-3 may help reduce the apoptosis of neu-
rons post-SCI and create a chemoattractive environment to
guide axons towards the scaffolds,24 the exact physiological
implications of our constructs versus the current hydrogel-
based platforms awaits further verification with detailed
in vivo studies.
Corresponding to the drop in protein release rate after
the first week, we observed a lack of neurite outgrowth in
DRGs that were subjected to supernatants beyond day 4.
Neurite length may be dependent on the dose of NT-3 when
the dosage is low (0–20 ng/mL).24,25,38 However, at higher
concentrations (>20–50 ng/mL), neurite length appears
to be independent of NT-3 concentration.24,25 Correspond-
ingly, we saw similar outcomes in our bioactivity assays. On
the basis of ELISA assay, 20 ng/mL of NT-3 remained in
day 4 supernatant. Compared to the positive control of
40 ng/mL, we saw a significant decrease in neurite out-
growth length. In the scaffold-based assay, we estimated a
total of 97.2 ng of NT-3 being released from the scaffolds
at day 2. This resulted in the insignificant difference in neu-
rite length between the samples and the positive control.
One possible reason may be the down-regulation of
neurotrophin receptors on DRG neurons.39,40 Regardless,
both assays clearly demonstrated the retention of NT-3
bioactivity within the nanofiber constructs. Furthermore,
NT-3-incorporated collagen scaffolds supported neurite out-
growth for at least 4 days. In contrast, neurite extension
was not observed in DRGs in the positive control by the
fourth day of culture. Although, we were unable to prolong
DRG culture beyond 4 days (likely due to limited nutrient
diffusion under static culture), our results suggested that
the collagen-based drug release system protected and pre-
sented NT-3 in a sustained manner to support neuronal
culture and neurite extensions for a longer time period as
compared to a bolus delivery of NT-3.
Bioactive ChABC was released in a sustained manner
from collagen nanofibers for at least 32 days. This appears
to match the in vivo CSPG expression kinetics, where a sig-
nificant increase followed by a peak at 2–4 weeks after SCI
is frequently observed.41,42 Comparing with currently avail-
able hydrogel platforms, the duration of ChABC release from
collagen nanofibers appears similar (hydrogels provided
4 weeks sustained release in vitro14 ). In the soluble ChABC
group, ChABC showed the highest bioactivity at day 1
because of the existence of higher amounts of soluble
ChABC. However, such advantage was quickly nullified by
day 2. Although, heparin was initially added to protect the
bioactivity of NT-3,24 we found that heparin was also able
to prevent the degradation of ChABC. Further studies to
evaluate the efficacy of these drug incorporated collagen
scaffolds in providing synergistic nanofiber topography and
multiple biochemical cues to enhance nerve regeneration in
SCI treatment will be evaluated by detailed in vivo studies.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of incorporat-
ing proteins onto electrospun collagen nanofiber scaffolds.
While the electrospinning of collagen has been reported
extensively, endowing such scaffolds with drugs for control
over cell fate remains unexplored. Our results demonstrate
the sustained release of NT-3 and ChABC for at least
28 days. Such biofunctional scaffolds may find useful appli-
cations in SCI treatment by providing topographical and
multiple biochemical cues to manipulate the growth inhibi-
tory environment and promote axonal regeneration.
