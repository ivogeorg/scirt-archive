Abstract
In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish recover locomotor function after spinal cord injury, in part due to the capacity of the cen-
tral nervous system to repair severed connections. To identify molecular cues that underlie regeneration, we conducted mRNA
expression profiling and found that syntenin-a expression is upregulated in the adult zebrafish spinal cord caudal to the lesion site
after injury. Syntenin is a scaffolding protein involved in mammalian cell adhesion and movement, axonal outgrowth, establish-
ment of cell polarity, and protein trafficking. It could thus be expected to be involved in supporting regeneration in fish. Syntenin-a
mRNA and protein are expressed in neurons, glia and newly generated neural cells, and upregulated caudal to the lesion site on
days 6 and 11 following spinal cord injury. Treatment of spinal cord-injured fish with two different antisense morpholinos to knock
down syntenin-a expression resulted in significant inhibition of locomotor recovery at 5 and 6 weeks after injury, when compared
to control morpholino-treated fish. Knock-down of syntenin-a reduced regrowth of descending axons from brainstem neurons into
the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site. These observations indicate that syntenin-a is involved in regeneration after traumatic
insult to the central nervous system of adult zebrafish, potentially leading to novel insights into the cellular and molecular mecha-
nisms that require activation in the regeneration-deficient mammalian central nervous system.
Introduction
Adult fish have the capacity for repair of central nervous system
injury (Bernstein, 1964; Becker et al., 1997, 1998, 2005). Use of
the adult zebrafish model of spinal cord injury (SCI) to investigate
spinal cord repair mechanisms has led to the identification of several
regeneration-related genes, such as adhesion molecules L1.1 (Becker
et al., 1998) and tenascin-C (Yu et al., 2011a), transcription factor
sox11b (Guo et al., 2011), cytokine fibroblast growth factor 2
(Goldshmit et al., 2012), miRNA 133b (Yu et al., 2011b), contac-
tin-2 (Lin et al., 2012) and major vault protein (Pan et al., 2013). In
adult zebrafish, successful regeneration depends on neuron-intrinsic
properties and a permissive environment for a successful neuronal
response to this environment (Becker et al., 1998, 2005), including
motoneuronal regeneration (Reimer et al., 2008) and glial bridge
formation (Goldshmit et al., 2012). In characterising the mRNA
expression profile of spinal cord cells caudal to the lesion site after
SCI (Guo et al., 2011), we observed upregulation of syntenin-a, the
homologue of mammalian syntenin-1.
Syntenins belong to an expanding family of PDZ domain-contain-
ing scaffolding proteins (Grootjans et al., 1997). Syntenin-1,
originally identified as melanoma differentiation-associated gene-9
(mda-9; Lin et al., 1996), was subsequently named syntenin
following its recognition as a syndecan-binding protein (Grootjans
et al., 1997; Sarkar et al., 2004). Syntenin-1 is widely expressed in
mammalian cells (Zimmermann et al., 2001), and is associated with
receptor clustering, protein trafficking, cytoskeleton signaling
(Grootjans et al., 1997; Sarkar et al., 2004, 2008; Yang & McCar-
thy, 2007; Beekman & Coffer, 2008) and metastatic potential
through cytoskeletal reorganisation in various cancer cells (Koo
et al., 2002; Boukerche et al., 2005; Hwangbo et al., 2010, 2011).
Thus, cytoskeletal reorganisation appears to be a major function of
syntenin-1 in many cell types due to its ability to interact with a
broad functional spectrum of molecules, such as syndecan, neurofa-
scin, ephrin-B, src, ubiquitin, Unc51.1, Rab5 and Sox4 (Grootjans
et al., 1997; Koroll et al., 2001; Tomoda et al., 2004; Beekman &
Coffer, 2008; Boukerche et al., 2008; McClelland et al., 2009;
Okumura et al., 2011; Rajesh et al., 2011; Das et al., 2012), result-
ing in distinct functional outcomes (Fig. S1A).
Syntenin-1 is widely distributed throughout the central nervous
system and is associated with axon extension, dendritic protrusion,
synapse formation and maturation (Zimmermann et al., 2001; Bene-
yto & Meador-Woodruff, 2004; Ohno et al., 2004; Tomoda et al.,
2004; Hirbec et al., 2005; Ko et al., 2006; McClelland et al., 2009;
Xu et al., 2011) and oligodendroglial precursor migration (Chatter-
jee et al., 2008). Recent reports reveal abundant expression of synte-
nin-1 in developing spinal cord (Jeon et al., 2013). Similar to
mammalian syntenin-1 and syntenin-2, zebrafish express syntenin-a
and syntenin-b. Syntenin-a is the zebrafish homologue of syntenin-1

(Fig. S1B), revealing epiboly progression (Lambaerts et al., 2012).
In this study, we established for the first time that syntenin-a is
required for functional regeneration, as would be expected from its
widely based cellular functions in mammalian cells. These observa-
tions may bear on our understanding of the functions of syntenin-a
in mammals.
Materials and methods
SCI model
The protocols for the SCI model were based on those described ear-
lier (Becker et al., 1997; Guo et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011a,b; Ma
et al., 2012). Briefly, male adult zebrafish (Danio rerio; body length
>2.5 cm, age 6 months; Huiyuan Aquatic Animals Company, Shan-
tou, Guangdong, China) were immersed in 0.033% aminobenzoic
acid ethylmethylester (MS222; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA)
in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3 (PBS) for 5 min to allow com-
plete anaesthesia. A longitudinal incision was made to expose the
vertebral column, and the spinal cord was cut completely between
two vertebrae, 4 mm caudal to the brainstem–spinal cord junction.
The sham-lesioned control was performed using the same proce-
dures, but without SCI. Incisions were sealed with Histoacryl (B.
Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The animal experiments were con-
ducted under the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of Shan-
tou University Medical College. Fish were kept on a 14-h light and
10-h dark cycle at 28 °C.
Morpholino (MO) application
Two different syntenin-a anti-sense MOs (Syn-MOs; NM_2126
91; Syn-MO1, 5′-CCTCTAGCGATGGGTACAACGACAT-3′; Syn-
MO2, 5′-TTCTGCTTTCAAACAAGCGACTTCT-3′; Gene Tools,
Philomath, OR, USA) and a standard control MO (Con-MO; 5′-
CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) were dissolved in Dani-
eau solution [in mM: NaCl, 58; KCl, 0.7; MgSO4, 0.4; Ca(NO3)2,
0.6; and HEPES, 5; pH 7.6] and soaked into small pieces of Gel-
foam (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI, USA). The Gelfoam was allowed to
dry and divided into smaller pieces containing 600 ng MO per
piece. One dried Gelfoam piece was inserted into the lesion imme-
diately after transection (Becker et al., 2004).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Zebrafish were deeply anesthetised with MS222 at 4, 12 h, 6 or
11 days after SCI or sham injury (n = 5 per group), and killed.
Spinal cord tissue 5 mm caudal to the lesion site was rapidly
removed, immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at 80 °C until
use.
Total RNA was extracted from frozen spinal cord samples using
an EZgeneTM Tissue RNA Miniprep Kit (Biomiga, San Diego, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty nano-
grams of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using PrimeScript RT
Master Mix (Takara). For qPCR analysis, the following primers
were used: syntenin-a, 5′-TTCACTTCTGCTCCAACC-3′ (forward)
and 5′-GTGGCATTAGCAAACTGG-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-GTG
TAGGCGTGGACTGTGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGGAGTCAAC-
CAGGACAAATA-3′ (reverse). The qPCR was performed using
SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) on
an ABI PRISM 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosys-
tems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Experiments were
performed in triplicate. Single PCR products were confirmed by
melting curves from qPCR. The results were normalised to GAPDH
and analysed using the 2ΔΔCt method (Livak & Schmittgen, 2001).
In situ hybridisation (ISH)
Zebrafish were deeply anesthetised with MS222 at 4, 12 h, 6 or
11 days after SCI or sham injury (n = 4 per group) and killed.
Spinal cord tissue 5 mm caudal to the lesion site was rapidly
removed and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
PBS at 4 °C for 6 h, and then washed in PBS containing 15%
sucrose for 8 h at 4 °C. Longitudinal frozen sections (16 lm) were
prepared in a cryostat (LEICA CM 1850) and stored at 80 °C
until use. Each slide contained a section from all time points in
order to accurately compare the signal between the time points.
Non-radioactive ISH was performed as described (Bernhardt
et al., 1996; Becker et al., 1998). DIG-labeled cRNA probes for
syntenin-a (NM_212691) were generated by in vitro transcription
using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, and represented bases 651–
1059 of the coding sequence. Spinal cord sections were hybridised
for 18 h at 55 °C after pre-hybridisation for 3 h at 55 °C. After
high-stringency washing, sections were incubated with alkaline
phosphatase-coupled anti-DIG Fab fragment antibodies (Roche) at
4 °C overnight, and color was developed with NBT/BCIP (nitro-
blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; Roche).
The specificity of hybridisation signals was determined by compari-
son with a sense cRNA probe under the same conditions.
Combined immunohistochemistry and ISH
We performed ISH and immunofluorescence in longitudinal frozen
sections (20 lm thick for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and 4 lm thick
for other cell markers) of spinal cord, 5 mm caudal to the lesion site,
taken at 6 days post-SCI or sham injury (n = 3 per group) to identify
the cell types expressing syntenin-a mRNA. ISH was performed as
described above. Following ISH, the sections were processed for
immunofluorescence. Sections were rinsed in PBS, then blocked with
1% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum in PBS. Thereafter,
sections were incubated with primary antibodies against HuC/D
(1:50; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes), Islet-1 (1 : 100; Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA, USA), GFAP (1 : 100;
Dako), or BrdU (1 : 200; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. Sections
were washed in PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies, including
Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1 : 500; Wuhan Boster Company,
China) and FITC-Affinipure goat anti-mouse (1 : 500; Jackson Im-
munoresearch) antibodies, for 1.5 h at room temperature. Fluorescent
images were observed using fluorescence microscopy (Axio Imager
Z1; Zeiss) and photographed using AxioVision software. To better
visualise fluorescent images superimposed on bright-field images,
Adobe Photoshop software was used to convert the brightfield ISH
image into a black-and-white negative image (gray scale image with
black and white reversed) prior to merging with the fluorescent
image. To label progenitor cells in S-phase, we intraperitoneally
injected BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (2.5 mg/mL) in a volume of
50 lL twice at a 2-h interval as described, and killed the fish 2 h
after the last injection (Adolf et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2011). Frozen
sections were processed for 30 min in 2 N HCl at 37 °C before incu-
bation with anti-BrdU antibodies.
Western blot analysis
The spinal cord samples were collected, as described above, 4,
12 h, 6 and 11 days after SCI, sham injury, MO application or

non-injury. Two pooled spinal cords per time point (n = 4) were
lysed in RIPA buffer with 1% PMSF (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and
centrifuged after homogenisation. Supernatants were transferred to
clean tubes and protein concentrations were determined by a
bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Solarbio). Proteins were sepa-
rated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes
(Millipore). Membranes were incubated with antibodies for synte-
nin-1 (1 : 500; cat. no. GTX108391; GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA)
and tubulin (1 : 1000; Beyotime Biotechnology, Haimen, China),
followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary goat anti-
rabbit for syntenin-1, and goat anti-mouse for tubulin (1 : 1500;
Wuhan Boster Company, China). Signals were visualised using a
BeyoECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Beyotime
Biotechnology) and photographed via FluorChem Q software (Alpha
Innotech’s Gel and Western Imaging Systems, San Leandro, CA,
USA). Quantitative band analysis was performed with ImageJ 1.44p
software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA) and
the results were normalised to tubulin.
Locomotor analysis
We used a swim-tracking test to analyse locomotor recovery as
described (Becker et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011a,b;
Ma et al., 2012). The total distance swum and duration of move-
ment (during 5 min) of freely moving fish was measured weekly
after SCI and MO application, using video tracking Ethovision XT
software (Noldus, Wageningen, the Netherlands).
Retrograde tracing
At 6 weeks after spinal cord transection and MO application, a sec-
ond transection was made at 4 mm caudal to the first spinal lesion
site and the axonal tracer biocytin (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied
immediately as described (Becker et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2011a,b;
Ma et al., 2012). After 24 h, the brain and brainstem were dissected
and immediately fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C for 12 h, then
incubated in PBS containing 15% sucrose for 12 h at 4 °C. Trans-
verse frozen sections (25 lm) were prepared in a cryostat (n = 3
fish per group). Sections were incubated with Cy3-conjugated strep-
tavidin (Bioss, Beijing, China) overnight at 4 °C, and then labeled
cells were counted under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.
Anterograde tracing
At 6 weeks following the swim-tracking test, biocytin was applied
to the second transection at the brainstem–spinal cord junction as
described (Yu et al., 2011a). Tissue 0–2 mm caudal to the original
lesion site was taken and immediately fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at
4 °C for 12 h, then incubated in PBS containing 15% sucrose for
12 h at 4 °C, and transverse frozen sections (25 lm) were prepared
in a cryostat. Sections were rinsed in PBS and blocked with 5%
bovine serum albumin in PBS. Thereafter, the sections were incu-
bated with primary antibody against synaptic vesicle protein 2
(SV2; 1 : 200; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) overnight
at 4 °C (n = 3 fish per group). Sections were washed in PBS, incu-
bated with FITC-Affinipure goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(1 : 500; Jackson Immunoresearch) for SV2, and Cy3-conjugated
streptavidin for biocytin, for 1.5 h at room temperature. Newly
formed synapses, defined as the point of colocalisation between bio-
cytin and SV2, were observed under confocal microscopy (Olym-
pus). For comparing regenerated axon profiles, three sections chosen
from the corresponding spinal cord levels were evaluated. Selected
sections per fish (n = 3 per group), at 0–2 mm caudal to the lesion
site from each group, were taken and Cy3-fluorescence was photo-
graphed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. The percentage of
threshold-stained area in the appropriate section area was measured
using Image J 1.44p software (Yu et al., 2011b). The experimenter
was blinded to the treatment.
Antibody specificity
The syntenin-1 antibody used for Western blot analysis labeled two
bands, but the predicted syntenin-a molecular mass (32 kDa) and
the syntenin-a antibody instructions from the GeneTex datasheet
(GTX108391), as well as the results comparing zebrafish samples
with U87-MG glioblastoma cells, supported the low band as being
the syntenin-a signal. The specificities of the antibodies for GFAP,
Islet-1, HuC/D, BrdU and SV2 used for immunofluorescence stain-
ing have been extensively verified and used successfully in previous
studies to specifically mark, respectively, glia, motoneurons, imma-
ture neurons, newly generated cells and synapses in the zebrafish
(Reimer et al., 2008; Hui et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2011; Yu et al.,
2011a; Goldshmit et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2013).
Statistical analysis
SPSS 17.0 software (IBM, USA) was used for data analysis. Data
are presented as means  SEM. We performed Student’s t-test or
one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test when appropri-
ate.
Results
Syntenin-a expression was upregulated in cells caudal to the
SCI site
To determine whether syntenin-a is involved in regeneration, we first
performed qPCR to investigate syntenin-a mRNA expression after
SCI. According to the microarray results (GEO accession number,
GSE20460; link for the GEO dataset is http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=jbkhpcakoummudg&acc=GSE20460),
levels of syntenin-a mRNA had increased by 11 days post-injury,
with a 1.4  0.1-fold change when compared to the sham-injured
control taken at the same time point.
To confirm and quantify syntenin-a upregulation, we took spinal
cord samples caudal to the lesion site at 4 and 12 h as well as at 6
and 11 days post-SCI, and performed qPCR. These time points rep-
resent the acute and the more chronic response phases of the spinal
cord to the injury (Guo et al., 2011). qPCR analysis showed that
syntenin-a mRNA levels were upregulated 1.5- to 2-fold at 6 and
11 days after SCI compared with sham-injured and untreated con-
trols. Expression peaked at 6 days, with a 2.1  0.5-fold increase in
expression (n = 5, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test,
P < 0.05), and then decreased to 1.5  0.2-fold at 11 days post-
SCI (n = 5, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, P < 0.05)
compared with the sham-injured controls (Fig. 1A). No significant
change in syntenin-a mRNA was seen in the acute phase response
to SCI (4 and 12 h).
We then measured syntenin-a protein levels at same time points
by Western blot analysis. In Western blots, syntenin-a antibody
reacted with a band of ~34 kDa molecular mass, identical to the the-
oretical molecular mass of zebrafish syntenin-a and similar to the
molecular weight of the band detected in human U87-MG glioblas-
toma cells (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis showed that syntenin-a

protein levels were increased 7.6  1.1- and 12.5  1.2-fold at
6 and 11 days post-SCI (n = 4, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
post hoc test, P < 0.05), respectively, compared with sham-injured
controls (Fig. 1C and D), and in temporal agreement with the qPCR
results.
In order to determine the cellular expression patterns of syntenin-
a in the spinal cord after SCI, we performed ISH on longitudinal
sections of the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site. Similar to our
qPCR results, syntenin-a expression was elevated at 6 and 11 days
post-SCI, compared with sham-injured (Fig. 2A) and non-injured
(Fig. 2C) controls, as well as at 4 and 12 h post-SCI. In non-injured
and sham-injured zebrafish, as well as in zebrafish at the early phase
of recovery (4 h and 12 h) post-SCI, syntenin-a was mainly
expressed with moderate signals in neuron-like cells and with weak
signals in glia-like and ependymal cells. However, in the chronic
phase spinal cord (6 and 11 days, and particularly at 6 days post-
SCI), syntenin-a was strongly expressed in both neuron- and glia-
like cells located in and around the central canal and in the white
matter. At 6 days post-SCI, there was a dramatic increase in
numbers of syntenin-a-immunopositive cells immediately adjacent to
the lesion site (Fig. 2B). No specific signals were detected in spinal
cord sections when hybridised with a syntenin-a sense mRNA probe
(Fig. 2D). These results show that syntenin-a expression is upregu-
lated in the chronic phase post-SCI.
Identification of cell types expressing syntenin-a
To determine the cell types up-regulating syntenin-a expression we
combined syntenin-a ISH and immunofluorescence for neural cell or
glial cell markers caudal to the lesion site at 6 days post-SCI or
sham injury (Figs 3–5). Syntenin-a mRNA was expressed in
neurons positive for the motoneuronal marker Islet-1 (Fig. 4Aa–c),
neurons expressing the immature neuronal marker HuC/D
(Fig. 4Ba–c) and GFAP-positive glial cells (Fig. 3). Newly gener-
ated cells, as judged by BrdU pulse labeling, were also positive for
syntenin-a mRNA (Fig. 5). In the sham-injured fish, syntenin-a
mRNA was mainly expressed in ependymal cells and neurons,
including motoneurons and immature neurons (Fig. 4A, B and Ca

Syntenin-a promotes spinal cord regeneration 2283
and b), and some GFAP-positive cells close to the central canal
(Figs 3A–D and 4, Ca and b). At 6 days post-SCI, as well as in
neurons, increased levels of syntenin-a mRNA were detected in a
higher percentage of GFAP-positive cells located at and around the
central canal (Figs 3E–H and 4, Da and b) compared to the sham-
injured fish. We found that all HuC/D-positive cells expressed synte-
nin-a, and that HuC/D-negative, GFAP-positive cells also express
syntenin-a 6 days after sham injury or post-SCI (Fig. 4C and D).
We also found that some BrdU-positive cells expressed syntenin-a
mRNA at 6 days post-SCI along the central canal site and in the
region surrounding the central canal (Fig. 5E–H) while fewer BrdU-
positive cells expressed syntenin-a mRNA along the central canal at
6 days after sham injury (Fig. 5A–D). Adjacent to the lesion site at
6 days post-SCI, several GFAP-positive glial cells co-expressing
syntenin-a appeared in an elongated bipolar form reminiscent of
ependymoradial glial cells (Fig. 4, Ea and b). These data indicate
that syntenin-a is located in different cell types in the spinal cord
and that expression is increased in the chronic phase post-SCI.
Syntenin-a promoted locomotor recovery
To investigate whether upregulation of syntenin-a expression is rele-
vant to the recovery of locomotor function we performed swim-
tracking analysis. At 5 weeks post-SCI, the total distance moved by
fish treated with two independent Syn-MOs was reduced (Syn-MO1,
510.5  153 cm in 5 min, n = 12, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
post hoc test, P < 0.05; Syn-MO2, 666.6  121.6 cm in 5 min,
n = 8, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, P < 0.05) com-
pared to the Con-MO (1239.3  110.9 cm in 5 min, n = 10) group,
with the swim performance of Con-MO being similar to that of
non-injured fish. Consistently, the duration of movement by fish
treated with two independent Syn-MOs was reduced (Syn-MO1,
99.3  33.3 s in 5 min, n = 12, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post
hoc test, P < 0.05; Syn-MO2, 110.9  34.7 s in 5 min, n = 8, one-
way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, P < 0.05) compared to the
Con-MO (233.2  26.6 s in 5 min, n = 10) group. Also at 6 weeks
post-SCI, the total distance moved and duration of movement by
fish treated with Syn-MO1 was reduced (total distance,
601.4  161.8 cm in 5 min, n = 12, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
post hoc test, P < 0.05; duration of movement, 109.1  33.2 s in
5 min, n = 12, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test,
P < 0.05) compared to the Con-MO (total distance,
1212.4  124.5 cm in 5 min, n = 10; duration of movement,
238.5  26.2 s in 5 min, n = 10) group (Fig. 6A). However, we
did not observe a significant reduction in the Syn-MO2 group in
swim capacity, most likely resulting from a less efficient knock-
down of translation when compared to MO1. The inhibition of syn-
tenin-a expression by MO1 and MO2 was determined by Western
blot analysis at 11 days after SCI and MO treatment. We confirmed
that both Syn-MO1 and Syn-MO2 reduced syntenin-a protein levels,
compared with the Con-MO, by 63% (n = 4, one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s post hoc test, P < 0.05) and 51% (n = 4, one-way ANOVA
with Tukey’s post hoc test, P < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 7A and B).
These results indicate that syntenin-a function is important for loco-
motor recovery.
Syntenin-a was associated with axonal regrowth
By 6 weeks post-SCI, the spinal cord of fish treated with Con-MO
had returned to almost normal appearance in tissue density at the
lesion site. In contrast, the tissue density of the spinal cord remained
reduced compared to the equivalent non-injured thoracic segment at
6 weeks post-SCI and Syn-MO1 treatment (Fig. 6B).
To determine the histological basis of the effect of Syn-MO treat-
ment in locomotor recovery, retrograde tracing was performed at
6 weeks post-SCI immediately after the swim tracking analysis. The
number of retrogradely labeled neurons in the nucleus of the medial
longitudinal fascicle (NMLF) was significantly reduced in fish trea-
ted with Syn-MO1 (9.3  3.5, n = 3, Student’s t-test, P < 0.05)
compared with Con-MO-treated fish (27.7  4.3, n = 3; Fig. 6C
and E). This result is consistent with previous studies showing that

anti-sense probe. Hybridisation signals were higher at 6 and 11 days com-
pared to corresponding sham-injured controls. Particularly at 6 days post-
SCI, strong signals were seen in neuron- and glia-like cells located in and
around the central canal and in white matter, compared with sham-injured
controls showing lower signals in neuron-like cells and weak signals in glia-
like cells and ependymal cells. (B) At 6 days post-SCI, syntenin-a-positive

the number of brainstem neurons with regenerated axons correlates
with the recovery of locomotor function of individual fish (Becker
et al., 1997, 2004).
Syntenin-a expression was associated with synapse formation
Anterograde tracing was also performed to investigate whether syn-
tenin-a is involved in synapse formation of regenerating axon termi-
nals caudal to the lesion site. Newly formed synapses, represented
by neurons co-labeled with the anterograde tracer biocytin and the
synaptic marker SV2, were decreased in number in the Syn-MO1-
treated fish (Fig. 8B and D) compared with Con-MO-treated fish
(Fig. 8A and C). In agreement with this observation is the finding
that the number of anterogradely labeled regrown axons labeled with
biocytin were also decreased, to 45% in Syn-MO1-treated fish com-
pared with Con-MO-treated fish (n = 3, Student’s t-test, P < 0.05;

labeled cell profiles were observed in the NMLF. We also failed to

Discussion
Treatment of SCI has remained problematic despite impressive
efforts and successes to gain insights into the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying the failures to regenerate after injury in adult
mammals. To date, there is still no effective treatment that is
accepted for therapy, although promising experimental techniques
have been suggested from studies on animals, such as neutralising
regeneration-inhibitory molecules, enhancing regeneration-conducive
molecules and transplanting stem cells (for more recent reviews see
Sahni & Kessler, 2010; Tohda & Kuboyama, 2011; Blesch et al.,
2012; Chew et al., 2012; Gage, 2012; Pernet & Schwab, 2012;
Sharma et al., 2012). Regrowth and/or sprouting of severed axons
and formation and/or remodeling of synapses are determined by the
extrinsic glial environment and intrinsic neuronal competence (Bern-
hardt et al., 1996; Becker et al., 1998, 2005; Bernhardt, 1999; Yiu
& He, 2006; Sun & He, 2010). As attempts to improve regrowth of
axons in the adult via deletion of inhibitory molecules have so far
failed to allow axons to regenerate over longer distances (Yiu & He,
2006; Sun & He, 2010), increased attention has been given to under-
standing the intrinsic regenerative ability of neurons. Syntenin-a may
be one of many molecules that enhances this recovery, as it is
expressed in neurons and neural precursor cells. Interestingly, synte-
nin-a is most prominently associated with recovery in the later, more
chronic, phases of recovery from injury in adult zebrafish,
suggesting that it preferentially affects the regrowth of axons and
formation and/or remodeling of synaptic contacts than conditioning
the tissue microenvironment. Nevertheless, syntenin-a mRNA and
protein levels are upregulated caudal to the lesion site in the chronic
phase after SCI. However, we have performed ISH in brain sections
and did not find a difference in numbers of cells and intensity of sig-
nal between fish with no injury, sham injury and 6 days post-injury
(data not shown). It is thus likely that intrinsic expression of synte-
nin-a in a non-injury situation is sufficient to ensure regrowth of ax-
ons after injury. It thus remains to be seen whether several beneficial
cues, neuron-intrinsic or tissue environment (neuron-extrinsic) or
both, are active in syntenin-a-mediated recovery from injury. Given
that syntenin-a covers a wide spectrum of functions, neuron-intrinsic
and -extrinsic features are likely to underlie the beneficial effects of
this molecule in regeneration.
It is interesting in this context that, in the early phase of regenera-
tion, glial cells accumulate at the lesion edge; this is followed by glial
migration to the lesion site. The formation of a glial bridge permits
axonal regeneration in zebrafish and enables axons to traverse the
lesion site in a caudal direction (Zukor et al., 2011; Goldshmit et al.,
2012). Our results reveal that syntenin-a is upregulated at 6 and
11 days post-SCI, consistent with the phase of glial accumulation and
glial bridge formation. In addition, syntenin-a expression also accu-
mulates in glial cells immediately adjacent to the lesion site at 6 days
post-SCI, further supporting the view that syntenin-a participates in
glial bridge formation and/or changes in glial morphology.
In the early development of zebrafish, the syntenin–syndecan–
PIP2–Arf6 complex affects cell movements (Lambaerts et al.,
2012), and it is thus possible that this complex is also associated
with newly generated neural cell and immature or mature glial cell
migration in recovery of adult zebrafish. Also, a correlation between
syntenin-1 and tyrosine kinase Src or focal adhesion kinase expres-
sion occurs in human melanoma cells, where syntenin-1 is associ-
ated with anchorage-independent growth, cell migration and
metastasis of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo (Boukerche et al.,
2008, 2010).
It is also noteworthy that some newly generated cells in the gen-
erative zone around the central canal express syntenin-a in the early
and late phases of recovery. Syntenin-1 has been reported to be up-
regulated in stem cell clusters of human interfollicular epidermis
(Estrach et al., 2007). In zebrafish, syntenin transcripts are mater-
nally supplied and expression of syntenin persists during gastrulation
(Lambaerts et al., 2012). These results show that syntenin-a is
expressed in early ontogenetic development, implicating this mole-
cule in important cellular functions providing cell motility and/or
orientation. It is therefore striking that these functions appear to be
recapitulated at least to some extent in regeneration of adult zebra-
fish, when some developmental events appear to provide an advan-
tage for regeneration. Consistently, expression decreases in the adult
mammalian central nervous system when maturation is completed,

although it is not known whether syntenin-a is downregulated in the
adult non-injured zebrafish nervous system. Whether regulated
expression in the adult central nervous system of mammals would
permit regeneration after injury remains to be seen.
