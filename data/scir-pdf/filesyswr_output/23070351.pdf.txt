This study reviews the literature concerning possible therapeutic approaches for spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury
is a disabling and irreversible condition that has high economic and social costs. There are both primary and
secondary mechanisms of damage to the spinal cord. The primary lesion is the mechanical injury itself. The
secondary lesion results from one or more biochemical and cellular processes that are triggered by the primary
lesion. The frustration of health professionals in treating a severe spinal cord injury was described in 1700 BC in an
Egyptian surgical papyrus that was translated by Edwin Smith; the papyrus reported spinal fractures as a ‘‘disease
that should not be treated.’’ Over the last two decades, several studies have been performed to obtain more
effective treatments for spinal cord injury. Most of these studies approach a patient with acute spinal cord injury in
one of four manners: corrective surgery or a physical, biological or pharmacological treatment method. Science is
unraveling the mechanisms of cell protection and neuroregeneration, but clinically, we only provide supportive care
for patients with spinal cord injuries. By combining these treatments, researchers attempt to enhance the functional
recovery of patients with spinal cord injuries. Advances in the last decade have allowed us to encourage the
development of experimental studies in the field of spinal cord regeneration. The combination of several
therapeutic strategies should, at minimum, allow for partial functional recoveries for these patients, which could
improve their quality of life.

INTRODUCTION
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disabling and irreversible
condition with high economic and social costs. The most
common cause is trauma, but this injury can also be caused
by tumors, infection, and vascular lesions or by iatrogenic
procedures. SCI increases the risk of depression, sleep
disorders, spasticity, bladder and gastrointestinal changes,
bedsores, sexual dysfunction, involuntary movements,
obesity, and vascular and respiratory diseases. The devel-
opment of therapeutic procedures depends on a better
understanding of the pathophysiology of SCI. Recent
literature reviews show that there is still no treatment for
SCI that results in complete neurological or functional
recovery (1,2).
There are both primary and secondary mechanisms of
damage to the spinal cord. The primary lesion is the
mechanical injury itself, and the secondary lesion results
from one or more biochemical and cellular processes that
are triggered by the primary lesion (3). Allen first postulated
the concept of a secondary injury in 1911 (4); he proposed
that the existence of noxious biochemical agents in necrotic
and hemorrhagic material caused additional spinal cord
damage.
A primary lesion that is caused by an impact to the spinal
cord consists of acute structural and physiological disrup-
tion of axons, nerve cell damage and blood vessel ruptures.
Hemorrhage and necrosis in the central gray matter occur
within the first hours after the injury (acute phase), followed
by edema and hemorrhage in the seven hours following the
trauma. The injury is the result of ischemia that is caused by
reduced blood flow to the affected spinal segment. This
reduction may be caused by a change in the spinal canal, by
significant edema and hemorrhage or by reduced systemic
blood pressure. Ischemia creates a chain of biochemical
reactions that result in cell death. Inflammatory cells then
simultaneously migrate to the injured site with glial cell
proliferation. The chronic phase lasts one to four weeks;
during this time, the proliferation and hypertrophy of
astrocytes form a glial scar or a cyst (5).
The most recent studies of the pathophysiological
processes that occur after central nervous system injury
provide rational support for treatment strategies and
demonstrate some improvements in neurological function
in SCI patients. An improved understanding of the primary
and secondary pathophysiological processes opens a
research field with experimental SCI models produced in
laboratories. Standardization of SCI experimental protocols
allows for reproducibility of the results and analyses (6,7).

SCI treatment measures include the prevention of
primary, secondary and tertiary lesions. Primary measures
include advertising campaigns to prevent spinal fractures
resulting from diving accidents, reduce the incidence of
traffic accidents, and enhance vehicle safety; campaigns to
promote disarmament; and projects to improve home
security, particularly to reduce the incidence of falls in the
elderly. Secondary prevention measures are being devel-
oped for application at the time of the accident and are
based on the foundations of adequate rescue and transpor-
tation to specialized treatment centers. Tertiary prevention
is the most complex rehabilitation phase. This phase
involves not only the patient’s family but also society as a
whole. Patients should be socially reintegrated to the
greatest extent possible after they leave hospitals.
THERAPEUTIC POSSIBILITIES
The frustration caused by a severe SCI was described in
1700 BC in an Egyptian surgical papyrus that was translated
by Edwin Smith; it reported that spinal fractures were a
‘‘disease that should not be treated’’ (8). Over the last two
decades, several studies have been performed to identify
more effective SCI treatments. Most of these studies
approach the treatment of acute SCI patients in one of four
manners: corrective surgery (2,9) or physical (10,11),
biological (12-15) and pharmacological treatment methods
(16-18).
Surgical techniques
Surgical techniques for SCI repair have been used for 40
years (2,19); however, the results have been controversial,
and the available data have been widely questioned (19).
The most commonly used approach is surgical decompres-
sion with or without arthrodesis. However, only 1% to 1.8%
of patients with cervical and thoracic SCI can walk after an
attempted surgical decompression (19). The role of surgery
in acute SCI is limited to spinal alignment, nerve decom-
pression and stabilization of the spine, which prevents
additional neurologic injury. The use of improved implant
materials allows the stabilization of unstable fractures in
reconstructive surgeries. Preventing further damage and
rehabilitating patients earlier are two known surgical
benefits (20).
Experimental study results have indicated that the
chances of neurological recovery improve with earlier
decompression (21). However, these studies did not coin-
cide with the findings of the best clinical studies (22). A 2012
study corroborated the findings of these experimental
studies. It indicated that when decompression is performed
within 24 hours after trauma, the chance of functional
recovery improves (23). These results emphasize the need
for promptly reducing dislocations and decompressing
fractures, either by cranial traction or through open surgery
(20,24,25).
Complications are another commonly reported challenge
in surgical treatment; however, they are decreasing as more
treatment centers specialize in spine surgery. The incidence
of complications related to the surgical approach is low (26).
Implant positioning errors are rare (27), ranging between 1
and 3% for the most modern techniques of fixation with
screws. This technique is even feasible in children (28).
Some surgical approaches are still considered experi-
mental, such as those seeking to build bridges to cross the
damaged area of the spinal cord. Central and peripheral
nerve cell grafts, coated Schwann cell tubes, olfactory glial
cells and genetically engineered fibroblasts are used for this
purpose (14). These techniques, combined with exogenous
neurotrophic factors (14), contribute new perspectives to the
study of functional axonal regeneration in SCI.
Biological therapy
Factors that promote neuronal regeneration, such as
tissue growth factors and autologous or homologous
totipotent cells, are biological therapies for SCI. Stem cell
and precursor cell transplantation for treatment of SCI has
been studied for approximately 10 years. Undifferentiated
cells are multipotent cells that have the capacity to
proliferate and propagate cells of any lineage or tissue type.
It has been previously shown in animal models that stem
cells transplanted into a normal or injured spinal cord can
differentiate into neurons or glia. Neuronal precursor cells
can be isolated and propagated in cultures in the presence of
mitogens and, when transplanted, may yield neurons and
oligodendrocytes. Stem cells can also differentiate into
astrocytes, indicating that environmental signals are crucial
for the specification of the lineage (29-31). Transplanted
stem and fetal cells could function not only as a bridge
between damaged spinal areas but might also potentially
release factors that stimulate axonal regeneration and
replace damaged cells (14,15). However, because of the
short-term monitoring and evaluation used in these
therapeutic studies, there is no clear consensus regarding
their results. Despite this controversy, stem cells remain a
future possibility for finding a cure for SCI (12).
More recently, studies involving central nervous system
cell transplantation have been directed to restore or reduce
the loss of function resulting from injury. It has been
reported that a transplant may decrease functional deficits
or increase functional recovery, particularly in degenerative
diseases. After central nervous system damage, transplants
may positively influence functional recovery through a
wide range of mechanisms, which include the non-specific
consequences of transplantation, trophic actions, the release
of hormones and transmitters and even mechanisms
involving the specific reinnervation of host cells and
establishment of reciprocal connections between the host
and transplanted tissues (13,32). Fetal central nervous
system cell transplantation bridges the gap between the
spinal cord and the supraspinal levels through the lesion
site. In addition, these cells can provide a population of cells
at the site of injury, which can serve as a substrate for re-
establishing communication between the levels above and
below the lesion (13).
The requirements for anatomical and functional SCI
repair are more complex than the requirements for the
recovery of other types of neurological damage, which often
only require that neurotransmitters be restored for func-
tional recovery (14). Transplantation using cells from the
central nervous system can improve motor function after
SCI and provides a more complex microenvironment than
that provided by the transplantation of peripheral nerves,
cell suspensions or genetically modified cells (14,33).
One recently discovered concept is that adult cells might
be reprogrammed to express genes that are typical of
differentiated cells in any of the three lineages (mesoderm,
ectoderm and endoderm). This discovery suggests that a
cell’s status is reversible and is subject to continuous

regulation by the surrounding medium. For example, one
study reported that bone marrow-derived cells adminis-
tered intravenously after sublethal irradiation resulted in
cells expressing neuron-specific genes (34,35). The manip-
ulation of these stem cells allows the prospect of future
cures for diseases currently considered incurable (14,36).
Physical means
Physical approaches are also employed to minimize
secondary spinal cord damage. The most studied
approaches are hypothermia, hyperbaric oxygen and
exercise, particularly on a treadmill. Several studies have
also shown the beneficial effects of local cooling by
perfusion or irrigation with hypothermic saline (37,38).
This approach is based on the assumption that low
temperatures protect central nervous system tissues from
the effects of hypoxia and ischemia. However, it is difficult
to apply this technique, and it carries a high mortality rate.
In addition, cooling therapy does not prevent potassium
loss, such as occurs in steroid therapy (39).
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a treatment modality that is
based on achieving a high partial pressure of oxygen in the
tissue by having the patient breathe pure oxygen inside a
hyperbaric chamber at a pressure greater than the atmo-
spheric pressure (40). The rationale for this therapeutic
approach is that a decrease in perfusion can be compensated
for by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen (11).
Positive results have been reported with the use of
hyperbaric oxygen treatment in SCI (37,41).
Several recent studies have reported the benefits of
exercise in animals subjected to SCI or in human victims
of accidents involving such injuries (42,43). Treadmill
training results in improvement in recovery, coordination
and neurological performance with various types of
exercise. There is extensive literature demonstrating the
beneficial effect of exercise on a treadmill on neuronal
plasticity in mice. This activity resembles exercises that can
be practiced by humans and are mandatory items in clinical
rehabilitation programs in SCI (44). Several studies have
suggested that one effect of training is to enable intrinsic
neuronal circuits (10). In these studies, the improvement in
gait ability and in movement dynamics and mechanics is
remarkable and encourages further investigation. Most of
the work in the international literature has demonstrated the
different methods of evaluating the benefits of physical
training alone. Few studies have evaluated the benefits of
exercise in combination with other therapeutic modalities
(45).
Pharmacological therapy
Pharmacology plays an important role in treating SCI.
Experimental and clinical trials show that medication can
effectively contribute to the treatment of secondary SCI (46).
Corticosteroids and gangliosides are already approved for
human use (47).
The most frequently studied corticosteroids are dexa-
methasone and methylprednisolone. Three multicenter
randomized, double-blind clinical trials have been con-
ducted to study the action of methylprednisolone and report
on its effectiveness in patients with SCI. Together, these
studies were called the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury
Study (NASCIS). The first (NASCIS1) was published in 1985
(48), the second (NASCIS 2) in 1992 and the third (NASCIS3)
in 1997 (16,49).
Steroid treatment of SCI is used mainly because the anti-
inflammatory action of steroids and their effectiveness in
treating cerebral edema. However, methylprednisolone also
increases blood flow and stabilizes the cell membranes,
inhibiting lipid peroxidation with a consequent reduction in
the production of free radicals (16,50).
Methylprednisolone has been experimentally tested as a
prophylactic method in surgeries with elevated risk of
spinal cord manipulation or lesion. However, no functional
improvement was observed in this clinical approach (51). In
addition, studies reviewing the methodologies used in
NASCIS and other research projects reported the deleterious
side effects of massive doses of corticosteroids. These side
effects have led many centers to avoid routinely using
corticoids, particularly methylprednisolone (53), for SCI
lesions (52).
Gangliosides are glycolipid molecules that are derived
from sialic acid. In vitro, they increase the formation and
growth of neurites, protoplasmic expansions of axons that
originate new functional connections, induce neuronal
regeneration and promote neuroplasticity (54). The GM1
ganglioside has been studied in SCI. There was a demon-
strated improvement in motor and sensory indices, even in
the sphincter function, in the SCI patients who received
GM1 compared to placebos (51). A recent systematic review
of drugs used in SCI showed that GM1 administration in
combination with physical therapy improved motor scores
and walking velocity and distance over a placebo or
physical therapy alone in individuals with incomplete SCI
(55).
In patients with traumatic SCI associated with neurologic
damage, the recommended ganglioside loading dose is
300 mg followed by 100 mg once daily for 30 days, via
intravenous or intramuscular injection. This drug should
not be administered simultaneously with methylpredniso-
lone (51).
Because oxidative stress is considered a hallmark of SCI
(56), the reduction of oxidative stress has been studied as a
therapeutic intervention for SCI. The goal was to prevent
free-radical-induced, iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation and
oxidative or nitrative damage to the neuronal proteins in the
spine (50). Lipid peroxidation induced by oxygen is a key
biochemical step in secondary damage to spinal cord cells
(53). Experimental studies show that antioxidants and free
radical blockers, alone or in combination, can accelerate the
functional recovery of rats with SCI (17).
Membrane disruption is thought to play an important role
in the pathology of SCI. Intracellular calcium is essential to
membrane releasing, and elevated intracellular calcium has
been linked to axonal deterioration (57). Myelin damage
creates aberrant potassium channels that inhibit conduction
(58). Some studies have shown that calcium channel
blockers increase medullary microcirculation (58). One
blocker that was clinically tested is nimodipine, but the
evidence did not recommend its clinical use in patients with
traumatic SCI (54). A selective inhibitor of KCa3.1 channels,
TRAM-34 (triarylmethane-34), improved locomotor func-
tion, reduced tissue loss and increased neuron and axon
sparing (59).
Aminopyridine is a potassium channel blocker that
improves nerve conduction in demyelinated axons (54,57),
with both motor and sensory functional improvement
(60,55). However, more studies are necessary to prove that
aminopyridine produces better results than a placebo (55).

High doses of methylprednisolone are required to achieve
neuroprotective effects and concern about the possible side
effects of this drug, which include gastrointestinal bleeding
and infection, have led researchers to develop drugs with
the protective effects of methylprednisolone but without its
side effects. Tirilazad (the non-glucocorticoid 21-aminoster-
oid tirilazad) has been noted as a promising medication in
clinical trials (56). It was tested in NASCIS 3, but is not used
clinically (49,61). Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that was
tested in animal models (62) and cases of SCI in the last
decade. Naloxone administration resulted in an increase in
spasticity (63). It was also studied during the NASCIS 2, but
exhibited no benefit over a placebo (64). This substance is
still experimentally studied, but is not yet used in clinical
practice.
The loss of regulatory descending serotonergic mechan-
isms after SCI contributes to motor deficits. However, the
use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (antidepres-
sants) has been reported to have a positive effect on limb
movement in SCI and increases the number of serotonin
receptors in the segments below the SCI. This increased
number of receptors may be indicative of a potential
treatment method because the increased administration of
serotonin receptor agonists has been previously reported to
ameliorate motor deficits (65,45). In addition, the adminis-
tration of serotonin precursors has also been reported to
have positive effects on motor recovery (66).
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
Until recently, the mammalian central nervous system
was believed to be unable to repair or regenerate itself after
devastating injury. However, the spinal cord does not
necessarily need to be rebuilt for SCI patients to recover
quality of life (67). Disproportionate benefits can be
obtained from minimal anatomical repairs. Further
advances, which may contribute to new SCI treatments,
are expected in the fields of cellular engineering and gene
therapy (68).
Science is continually unraveling the mechanisms of cell
protection and neuroregeneration, but clinically, we are
only providing supportive care for SCI patients. Therapeutic
advances made in the last decade have allowed the
development of experimental work in the field of spinal
cord regeneration. The combination of several strategies
should make, at minimum, partial functional recovery
possible for SCI patients, which might consequently lead
to an improvement in their quality of life. Through
combined treatment strategies, the enhanced functional
recovery of SCI patients will likely be achieved.
