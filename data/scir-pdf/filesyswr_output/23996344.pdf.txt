Abstract High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1, also called
amphoterin) facilitates neurite outgrowth in early develop-
ment, yet can exacerbate pathology and inhibit regeneration
by inducing adverse neuroinflammation when released from
dying cells, suggesting that HMGB1 plays a critical, yet
undefined role in neuroregeneration. We explored whether
HMGB1 contributes to recovery after complete spinal cord
transection in adult zebrafish. Quantitative PCR and in situ
hybridization revealed that HMGB1 mRNA levels decreased
between 12 h to 11 days after spinal cord injury (SCI), then
returned to basal levels by 21 days. Western blot and
immunohistological analyses indicated that the time course of
HMGB1 protein expression after SCI parallels that of mRNA.
Immunofluorescence staining revealed that HMGB1 translo-
cates from nuclei into the cytoplasm of spinal motoneurons at 4
and 12 h (acute stage) following SCI, then accumulates in the
nuclei of motoneurons during the ensuing chronic stage (after
6 days following SCI). Immunohistology of transgenic
zebrafish, expressing green fluorescent protein in blood ves-
sels, showed enhanced HMGB1 expression in blood vessels
in the vicinity of motoneurons. Application of anti-sense
HMGB1 morpholinos inhibited locomotor recovery by 34 %
and decreased axonal regeneration by 34 % compared to fish
treated with a control morpholino. The present study shows
that HMGB1 expression increases in both endothelial cells and
motoneurons, suggesting that HMGB1 promotes recovery
from SCI not only through enhancing neuroregeneration, but
also by increasing angiogenesis. The inflammatory effects of
HMGB1 are minimized through the decrease in HMGB1
expression during the acute stage.

Introduction
The development of the central nervous system is highly sim-
ilar between mammals and lower vertebrates, yet the ability of
higher vertebrates to recover from central nervous system inju-
ry, which in lower vertebrates recapitulates central nervous
system development, is absent. Spinal cord recovery in lower
vertebrates involves both neurogenesis and inflammation.
However, due to the potential of inflammation to inhibit
neurogenesis, to successfully accomplish neuroregeneration
the processes of neurogenesis and inflammation must be highly
coordinated. HMGB1 is a protein central to both neurogenesis
and inflammation. We previously showed that, HMGB1
mRNA in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle
(NMLF) decreases to 87 % at 12 h and by 11 days after SCI,
HMGB1 is increased to 113 % compared with the sham injury
group [1]. HMGB1, containing twoDNA binding domains and
a C-terminal tail, has been identified both as a non-histone

chromosomal protein in nuclei, and as a cytokine in the extra-
cellular environment, and plays an important role in both
mammalian and zebrafish nervous systems [2]. During early
development, HMGB1 is widely expressed in both the nuclei
and cytoplasm of cells in neurogenic brain structures, including
the hippocampal dentate gyrus, olfactory bulbs and cell lining
of the telencephalic ventricles [3], and is detectable in the nuclei
of adult neurons and astrocytes [4], spinal cord oligodendro-
cytes [5], choroid plexus endothelial cells [6], and in vitro in
microglia [7]. Knock-down of HMGB1 in zebrafish embryos
leads to a marked reduction in numbers of tyrosine
hydroxylase-expressing neurons in the forebrain and a reduc-
tion in brain size [8], and, in vitro, HMGB1 promotes neurite
outgrowth of N18 neuroblastoma cells, cortical neurons and
cerebellar granule cells [9–11]. HMGB1 is upregulated in rat
spinal cord at 72 h after injury, and increases in rat brain by
3 days following ischemia [12, 13]. This broad distribution in
the nervous system, involvement in neurogenesis, and
upregulation following spinal cord injury suggests that
HMGB1 plays a prominent role in recovery from central ner-
vous system injury.
HMGB1 released from microglia and/or degenerating neu-
rons producesmultiple inflammatory and neurotoxic factors [7].
In contrast to the neurogenic properties of HMGB1, HMGB1 is
highly inflammatory upon release from cells [14], and can
contribute to neuropathology and inhibition of neurogenesis
through secondary tissue damage. During pathological changes
in mammals, HMGB1 is released into the extracellular environ-
ment and mediates inflammation through binding to the recep-
tor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and toll-like
receptors (TLR)-2, TLR-4, and TLR-9 [15–18]. In a rabbit SCI
model, the level of HMGB1 in serum increases at 72 h after
injury and leads to elevation of TNF-α and apoptosis of moto-
neurons, and reduction of HMGB1 serum concentrations is
associated with better survival of neurons in the spinal cord
[19, 20]. In the rat spinal nerve ligation model, HMGB1 ex-
pression is strongly enhanced at 7 days after ligation and
induces neuropathic pain by neuroinflammation, with the pain
being alleviated after application of HMGB1 antibody [21]. In
addition, HMGB1 overexpression in astrocytes promotes
neurovascular remodeling following ischemia, and inhibition
of HMGB1 reduces density of microvessels in the peri-infarct
area and impairs recovery of locomotor ability in ischemic mice
compared with non-ischemic control mice [22]. Together, these
observations suggest that HMGB1 plays dual and antagonistic
roles during regeneration after central nervous system injury.
To delineate the roles of HMGB1 in recovery following
SCI, we used an adult zebrafish model in which nearly full
locomotor activity is recovered within 6 weeks after complete
transection of the thoracic spinal cord. We show that HMGB1
expression rapidly decreases within 12 h after spinal cord
injury, and that decreased HMGB1 levels persist for 11 days,
followed by a full recovery by 21 days. These changes in
HMGB1 expression were observed in both motoneurons and
the spinal cord vascular system. Further, inhibition of HMGB1
expression by anti-sense morpholinos retarded the recovery of
locomotor ability and axonal regeneration across the lesion site.
These results are consistent with a model for recovery from
spinal cord injury in which an HMGB1 is initially released to
promote neurogenesis and cell survival, then downregulated to
minimize inflammation during recovery.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Wild-type adult zebrafish (Danio rerio , 6 months old) were
purchased from the Huiyuan Aquatic Animals Company
(Shantou, Guangdong, China). Fli1a::EGFP transgenic fish,
in which EGFP is driven by the endothelial cell-specific Fli1
promoter [23], were kindly provided by Professor ZilongWen
(Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). All fish
used in the experiments were kept on a 14-h light and 10-h
dark cycle at 28 °C, and fed twice a day. All animal experi-
ments were approved by the Animal ethics Committee of
Shantou University Medical College.
Spinal Cord Injury
Spinal cord transection was performed as described [24].
Briefly, fish were anaesthetized by immersion in 0.033 %
aminobenzoic acid ethylmethylester (MS222, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4
(PBS) for 5 min. A longitudinal incision was made at the side
of the fish to expose the vertebral column. The spinal cord was
cut between two vertebrae, approximately 4 mm caudal to the
brainstem/spinal cord transitional junction. Wounds were
sealed with Histoacryl (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany),
and the injured fish were kept individually at 28 °C. A sham
control lesion was performed by making the incision, but
omitting the spinal cord transection. All surgical procedures
were performed on ice under a microscope.
Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR
To study the expression of HMGB1 mRNA (NM_199555) in
the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site, total RNA was
extracted from the 4 mm segment of spinal cord directly caudal
to the lesion site at different time points after SCI. First-strand
cDNA was generated using random primers and a ReverTra
AceR qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed
with a SYBRR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix
(TOYOBO) as previously described [25]. Primers for qPCR
were designed using Primer Express 5.0 software (Applied
Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:472–483 473
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All assays were performed
in duplicate, and assay products were validated using melting
curves to confirm the presence of single PCR products.
GAPDH served as the internal control [26]. The following
primer sequences were used: zebrafish HMGB1 forward:
GAGCGATGGAAGACTATGT, reverse: TCGGAACTCGG
AGCAGA. GAPDH forward: GTGTAGGCGTGGACTGT
GGT, reverse: TGGGAGTCAACCAGGACAAATA [27]. A
no-template control group was performed in each experiment
using the same reaction conditions at different time points. The
number of fish for this assay was six for each group.
In Situ Hybridization
In situ hybridization probes (sense and anti-sense) for
HMGB1 mRNAwere transcribed in vitro. Purified PCR frag-
ments were cloned into the pGM-T vector (Tiangen, Beijing,
China), and the sequences were verified by sequencing.
Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled sense and anti-sense RNA probes
were generated using the Megascript system (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Non-radioactive detection of mRNA in sections of the
adult zebrafish was performed as described with small mod-
ifications [28, 29]. Spinal cords were fixed for 24 h in 4 %
paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C, followed by incubation in
15 % sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Then, 16-μm-thick
sections of spinal cords were cut from fresh-frozen tissue on a
cryostat, pre-hybridized for 2 h at 55 °C, and hybridized with
the DIG-labeled probes at 55 °C overnight. After extensive
washing (at 50 °C), alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-DIG
fragment antibodies (Fabs, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
were applied at room temperature for 1 h. Antibody binding
was detected using an alkaline phosphatase reaction with
nitro-blue-tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phos-
phate (NBT/BCIP, Roche) as substrates. As a negative control,
sense probes were developed in parallel under the same con-
ditions as the anti-sense probes. Sections from sham control
and injured fish were analyzed on the same slides. All sections
were viewed and photographed using an epifluorescence mi-
croscope (Axio Imager Z1, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
Three fish were analyzed for each group.
Immunohistochemistry
All tissues were processed for immunofluorescence after fixa-
tion in 4 % formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Serial
sections (16 μm in thickness) from the spinal cord (longitudi-
nal, 0–4 mm caudal to lesion site) were used. Sections were
prepared as described above and processed for immunostaining
[30]. The primary antibodies against zebrafish HMGB1 were
raised in rabbits [8] (1:200), and against zebrafish anti-Islet-1 in
mice (1:200, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,
University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA). Secondary antibodies
were Alexa Fluor 594- or CY3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:800, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, USA) and
FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:800, Jackson
ImmunoResearch). Fluorescence images were collected using
an epifluorescence microscope (Axio Imager Z1, Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) [31]. Motoneuronal cell bodies were
identified as Islet1-immunopositive cells. Motoneurons touch-
ing the endothelial cells of blood vessels were counted in
longitudinal sections of fli1a::EGFP transgenic and wild-type
zebrafish. Sections were obtained from eight randomly chosen
sites on the spinal cord 0–4 mm in length caudal to the original
spinal lesion site. The number of fish assayed was three for
each group.
Western Blot Analysis
Total protein was extracted by homogenizing spinal cord
tissue in RIPA buffer (Soliba, Beijing, China). After centrifu-
gation of the homogenate at 14,000×g and 4 °C, protein
concentration in the supernatant was determined with a BCA
kit (Pierce, Rockford, USA). The supernatant was denatured
by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Fifty micrograms
of total protein was then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10 %
gels. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane and probed with the following antibodies: rabbit
anti-zebrafish HMGB1 (1:2,000) and mouse anti-zebrafish
GAPDH (1:1,000, Beyotime, Haimen, China). Goat anti-
rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000, Jackson
ImmunoResearch) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were
used as secondary antibodies. The membrane with proteins
was incubated with BeyoECL Plus (Beyotime) for 1 min and
imaged by a Gel Image System (Alpha Innotech, San
Leandro, USA). The gray value of each band was measured
and normalized to that of the GAPDH band using ImageTool
software (San Antonio, Texas, USA). Five fish were assayed
in each group.
Morpholino Treatment
HMGB1 anti-sense morpholino (MO) (5′-GATCCTTCCCC
ATCTTTGCCTAAAT-3′, vivo-porter-coupled) and standard
control MO (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′,
vivo-porter-coupled) (Gene Tools, Philomath, OR, USA)
were dissolved in Danieau solution [32] and soaked in
small pieces of Gelfoam (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI,
USA). These pieces of Gelfoam were divided into
smaller pieces to yield 800 ng of MO (approximately
0.2 μl MO per piece). One piece was applied to the
transection site immediately after spinal cord transection.
Each animal was allowed to survive the surgery for 6 weeks
[29].

Swim Tracking
Swimming capabilities of injured fish were assessed each
week after MO application for 4 weeks in two trials of
5 min each (trial interval, 4 h). In each trial, a zebrafish was
placed in a brightly illuminated (100 lx) tank (42×30×30 cm)
filled with aquarium water (5 cm deep) at 25 °C. A video
camera recorded the trials above the tank. Swim paths were
tracked with ethovision software (Noldus, Wageningen, The
Netherlands). Mean lengths of the swim paths (total distance
moved) of the two trials were used for graphic presentation
and statistical analysis. The experimenter was blinded to the
treatment of the animals. The number of fish analyzed for this
assay was nine for each group.
Anterograde Tracing
To study whether regenerated axons had passed the lesion site,
biocytin was applied via a second surgery at the site of the
brainstem/spinal cord junction at 6 weeks after SCI [33–35].
After 24 h, spinal cords were removed, and blocks of tissue
from 0–4 mm caudal to the original spinal lesion site were
fixed in 4 % formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight, embed-
ded in 15 % sucrose, and sectioned coronally (in 25-μm-thick
sections) or longitudinally (in 16-μm-thick sections) on a
cryostat. Biocytin labeling was detected with Streptavidin-
Cy3 (1:400, Bioss). Three animals were in each group (control
MO- or HMGB1 MO-treated). Fluorescence intensity was
presented as the mean intensity evaluated by ImagePro plus
software (Media Cybernetics) from 12 randomly selected
spinal cord sections 0–4 mm caudal to the lesion site from
each group. Four animals from each group were analyzed.
Statistical Analysis
Using SPSS 13 software, the independent sample t test was
used for comparing the two treatment groups, and one-way
ANOVA was used for multiple group comparisons. Data are
presented as means±SEM. P <0.05 was set as the threshold
for significance (*P <0.05, **P <0.01). All experiments were
performed in triplicate.
Results
HMGB1 mRNA Levels Along the Caudal Part of the Central
Canal Change with Time After SCI
To explore the involvement of HMGB1 in the regeneration of
spinal cord-injured adult zebrafish, expression of HMGB1
mRNA in the spinal cord was examined by real-time qPCR
and in situ hybridization at different time points after complete
spinal cord transection. Time points at 4 and 12 h represent the
acute response phase of the injury, and those at 6, 11, and
21 days represent the chronic response phase. HMGB1
mRNA levels were increased by twofold at 4 h after SCI,
but were decreased by 12 h after SCI compared with the sham
injury group. From 12 h to 11 days after SCI, HMGB1mRNA
expression was maintained at a low level (*P <0.05, indepen-
dent sample t test; n =6), then gradually returned to the sham
injury group level at 21 days (P >0.05) (Fig. 1a). The poly-
merization and Ct value of the no-template control group were
undetectable. The qPCR results were confirmed by in situ
hybridization. In the sham injury group (4 h after sham injury),
HMGB1 mRNA-positive signals were mostly in neurons and
some in ependymal cells lining the central canal. At 4 h after
SCI, HMGB1 mRNA-positive cells were primarily ependymal
cells along the central canal caudal to the lesion site, indicating
that injured neurons had lost HMGB1 expression. At 12 h,
6 days and 11 days after SCI, a significant decrease in HMGB1
mRNA levels was detected in both the ependymal cells and in
motoneurons, when compared to the sham injury group
(Fig. 1b). However, by 21 days after SCI, HMGB1 mRNA
signals, along the central canal and in motoneurons, were
similar in both SCI and sham groups. No signal was detected
in sections incubated with sense probes, and no significant
difference was found between non-injured zebrafish and the
sham injury group (data not shown). Therefore, HMGB1 levels
rapidly decrease and are maintained at low levels following
SCI.
Acute Stage Downregulation and Chronic Stage Recovery
of HMGB1 Protein Levels Following SCI
To investigate the effects of SCI onHMGB1 protein expression
and distribution, Western blot analysis and immunohistology
were performed at different time points after SCI. Zebrafish
spinal cord tissues were harvested at 4 and 12 h, and at 6, 11
and 21 days after SCI. HMGB1 protein levels decreased by
12 h after SCI compared to sham-injured and uninjured fish. At
6 days after SCI, the level of HMGB1 protein levels had
declined by 25 %, and continued to decrease to 50 % of the
sham injury group until 11 days after SCI (P <0.05, one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test; n =5). By 21 days after
injury, HMGB1 protein returned to levels similar to those of the
sham injury group (P >0.05) (Fig. 2a, b). Therefore, similar to
HMGB1 mRNA, HMGB1 protein levels also decreased fol-
lowing SCI, although the decrease in protein quantitatively
lagged behind the decrease in mRNA levels.
Immunohistology was performed to locate the intracellular
distribution of HMGB1. In the sham injury group, HMGB1
was mainly localized to cell nuclei in the ependymal cells
lining the central canal. At 4 h after SCI, HMGB1 was not
only detectable in nuclei, but was also detectable in the cyto-
plasm. From 12 h to 11 days post-injury, HMGB1 protein
levels decreased and increased again by 21 days in both
Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:472–483 475
cytoplasm and nuclei in cells in the vicinity of the central canal
(Fig. 2c). Since ependymal cells of the spinal cord form a stem
cell niche which promotes regeneration after SCI [36], this
possibly reflects changes in HMGB1 levels within the neural
stem cell population.
HMGB1 Localizes in Both Nuclei and Cytoplasm
of Motoneurons After SCI
To investigate whether motoneurons express HMGB1,
double-immunostaining was performed for HMGB1 and
Islet-1 (a marker for motoneurons) in uninjured, sham-
injured, and injured zebrafish at varying times after SCI. In
the spinal cords of sham-injured zebrafish, most of the
HMGB1 staining was present in motoneuron nuclei. At 4 h
after SCI, localization of HMGB1 became cytoplasmic. By
12 h after SCI, HMGB1 decreased in the cytoplasm of moto-
neurons. However, by 6 to 11 days after SCI, HMGB1 could
again be detected in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of
motoneurons. In the 21-day SCI group, HMGB1 levels de-
clined in the cytoplasm but were again found in the nuclei
(Fig. 3). There was no difference in the co-localization of
HMGB1 and Islet-1 between sham-injured and uninjured
zebrafish, and at the time points investigated, there was no
difference between sham-injured and uninjured animals (data
not shown). These results show that HMGB1 is present in
motoneuron nuclei, and is translocated to the cytosol and
downregulated following injury. Similar to the localization
observed in endothelial cells, recovery initially involves re-
expression of HMGB1 in both cytosol and nuclei, followed by
a gradual return to exclusive nuclear localization.
HMGB1 Is Expressed in Endothelial Cells and Associated
with Motoneurons After SCI
We investigated the relationship between HMGB1 expression
in endothelial cells and the localization of motoneurons along
the central canal by using Fli1a::EGFP transgenic fish, which

express EGFP in endothelial cells, and analyzed the expression
pattern of HMGB1 in the vasculature over time after SCI by
examining the cell bodies of motoneurons adjacent to blood
vessels. Interestingly, HMGB1 was strongly upregulated in
blood vessels at 6 days and decreased at 11 and 21 days after
SCI compared to the sham injury group (Fig. 4a). In parallel, the
numbers of motoneurons adjacent to blood vessels increased by
242 % over the sham injury group at 6 days after SCI, and by
168 % at 21 days after SCI (Fig. 4b and c) (P<0.05). Thus,
recovery is marked by an increased density of motoneurons
adjacent to blood vessels.
Inhibition of HMGB1 Protein Expression After SCI Retards
Locomotor Recovery After SCI
Application of an HMGB1 anti-sense MO at the time of SCI
reduced levels of HMGB1 protein by 49 %, as judged by
Western blot analysis of spinal cord tissue below the lesion site,
when compared to the standard control MO, when measured at
4 weeks after SCI (*P <0.05, independent sample t test; n =5)
(Fig. 5a, b). HMGB1 MO also reduced functional recovery
after SCI, as quantified by the distance swum within a given
amount of time. At 1 week after SCI, no difference between the
groups treated with HMGB1MO and standard controlMOwas
observed (Fig. 5c). However, HMGB1MO-treated fish showed
retardation of locomotor recovery at 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-
injury. At 2 weeks after SCI, the total distance moved by fish
treated with HMGB1 MO (855.7±178.3 cm, n =9, *P <0.05)
was reduced by 64.6 % compared to that of fish treated with
control MO (1,365.2±123.7 cm, n =9). At 3 weeks after
SCI, the distance moved in 5 min of HMGB1 MO-
treated fish (986.6±82.8 cm, n =9, *P <0.05) was
34 % less than that of the control MO group (1,493.6±
85.6 cm, n =9). Similarly, at 4 weeks after SCI, the total
distance moved by fish treated with HMGB1 MO (1,144.1±
116.4 cm, n =9, *P <0.05) was 33 % less than that of the
control group (1,711.8±228.4 cm, n =9). Thus, HMGB1
MO treatment strongly reduces locomotor recovery, in-
dicating a requirement for HMGB1 in spinal cord
regeneration.

a Western blot analysis shows HMGB1 protein expression in the spinal
cord caudal to the lesion site at different time points after SCI. Significant
downregulation was detected at 12 h, and 6, and 11 days after SCI
compared to the sham injury group at 4 h. At 21 days after SCI, the level
of HMGB1 protein returned to the level of the sham injury group. b The
intensity of bands was quantified with ImageTool software. The fold

sion in the spinal cord 4 mm caudal to the lesion site was examined by
immunofluorescence in longitudinal sections at different time points after

to basal levels at 21 days after SCI. Asterisks indicate the central canal.

Reduction of HMGB1 Protein Levels Impairs Axon
Regrowth Beyond the Lesion Site After SCI
To further elucidate the protective role of HMGB1 in spinal
cord regeneration, we studied axonal regrowth/sparing be-
yond the lesion site by anterograde tracing. Biocytin was
applied at the brainstem/spinal cord junction of fish at 6 weeks
after SCI [37]. After 24 h, biocytin was detected with
Streptavidin-Cy3 at a site 4 mm distal to the first lesion site.
Axon regrowth/sparing beyond the first lesion site is illustrat-
ed in coronal and longitudinal sections. The numbers of
biocytin-positive axons in coronal and longitudinal sections
fromHMGB1-inhibited SCI zebrafish were considerably few-
er than those from SCI zebrafish treated with control MO. An
uninjured group was used as a normal control. Axonal signals
in the uninjured group were considerably stronger than either
the HMGB1- or control MO-treated groups (Fig. 6a).
Immunofluorescence intensity analysis of biocytin in coronal
sections of zebrafish treated with HMGB1 MO showed a
34 % decrease in axonal regrowth/sparing compared with
zebrafish treated with standard MO after SCI (P <0.05)
(Fig. 6b). These observations support the view that HMGB1
is involved in axonal regrowth, allowing locomotor recovery
during regeneration after SCI.
Discussion
HMGB1 Expression is Downregulated in the Acute Stage
and Restored in the Chronic Stage After SCI

focus on rodents and on short periods of observation after the
injury. HMGB1 expression in the rat is enhanced at 48 h after

localization in motoneurons along

mainly present in nuclei of
motoneurons in the sham injury
group. After SCI, it is expressed
in the cytoplasm during the acute
stage (4 and 12 h). By 6 and
11 days after SCI, a low level of
HMGB1 was maintained in the
cytoplasm, and HMGB1 becomes
expressed again mainly in the
nuclei. At 21 days after SCI,
HMGB1 expression was restored
in the nuclei and retained at a low
level in the motoneuron
cytoplasm. Asterisks indicates the

upregulation of TNF-α [12]. In a rat spinal nerve ligation
model, HMGB1 mRNA levels are high at 7 days after the
lesion [21], and HMGB1 protein levels in adult rats are
increased in serum at 10 days after brain ischemia [13]. In
mice and humans afflicted with stroke, HMGB1 protein is

released into the blood between 6 and 24 h after ischemia [13,
38]. The rapid and persistent elevation of HMGB1 seen in
higher vertebrates contrasts the rapid decrease in HMGB1
levels following SCI observed here. Because HMGB1 is a
highly pro-inflammatory factor, it is possible that lower levels
of HMGB1 after SCI in zebrafish may ameliorate persistent
inflammation, resulting in greater cell survival and less tissue
damage during a period of recovery, enabling regeneration to
proceed as signaled by the later return of HMGB1 to basal
levels.
It is noteworthy in this context that acute inflammation in
zebrafish after central nervous system injury has led to improved
recovery. Cerebroventricular injection of immunogenic zymo-
san A into adult zebrafish induces acute neuroinflammation and
results in increased numbers of newly born neurons compared to
animals injected with vehicle only [39]. In zebrafish with trau-
matic brain injury, injection of the anti-inflammatory agent
Pranlukast before the injury inhibits leukotriene signaling in
activated radial glial cells and decreases proliferation of neurons
when compared to vehicle-only injected animals [39]. Given
that acute inflammation has been suggested to stimulate regen-
eration [39], our demonstration that an increase in HMGB1
mRNA levels occurs at 4 h after SCI in zebrafish suggests that
acute inflammation occurs at very early stages after injury and
would suggest a model in which an initial, transient inflamma-
tory HMGB1 release occurs immediately after SCI to stimulate
neurogenesis and/or promote cell survival, followed by a de-
crease in HMGB1 levels to prevent persistent inflammation that
would be detrimental to neurogenesis.
The increase in HMGB1 mRNA, observed at 4 h after SCI,
occurs in the absence of changes in protein level. One possible
explanation is that the short duration of increased mRNA
expression of HMGB1 may not be sufficient to accumulate
protein. Alternatively, the increase in HMGB1 mRNA occurs
to counter mechanisms responsible for the rapid decrease in
HMGB1 expression, observed at 12 h, in order to maintain
sufficient HMGB1 levels to stimulate neurogenesis or pro-
mote cell survival, consistent with our model. The detailed
mechanism remains to be studied.
HMGB1 is Expressed in Both Motoneurons and Blood
Vessels
HMGB1 is expressed in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neu-
rons, as well as in microglia and astrocytes in the central
nervous system of adult vertebrates [7, 8, 22]. In the present
study, we further demonstrate that HMGB1 is expressed in
motoneurons and blood vessels. Interestingly, at 4 h after SCI,
localization of HMGB1 in motoneurons is mainly cytoplas-
mic, possibly making HMGB1 accessible to release or more
accessible to the cellular protein degradation machinery, while
at 12 h after SCI, HMGB1 protein remains cytoplasmic, but at
reduced levels inmotoneurons through 11 days after SCI, after
which HMGB1 increases. It is thus not unlikely that HMGB1
translocates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm during the
acute stage after SCI. By 21 days after SCI, most HMGB1-
positive motoneurons revert to the pattern of the sham-injured
controls, with most of the signal localized in the nuclei. At this
time, HMGB1 expression is at similar levels as the sham
injury group and parallels the improvement in locomotor
function, suggesting that the presence of HMGB1 in moto-
neuron nuclei facilitates functional restoration during the first
3 weeks after SCI.
Expression of HMGB1 in blood vessels after SCI suggests
a role for HMGB1 in neurovascular protection. Previous
studies show that transgenic mice overexpressing HMGB1
show smaller myocardial infarction volumes than wild-type
mice. These mice also show higher capillary and arteriole
densities at 4 weeks after myocardial infarction than wild-
type mice [40]. After intracerebral hemorrhage-induced brain
injury in rats, inhibition of HMGB1 decreases levels of vas-
cular endothelial growth factor and retards functional recovery
[41], suggesting that HMGB1 enhances angiogenic regenera-
tion. In the present study, HMGB1 expression was remarkably
elevated in the neural vasculature after SCI. In addition, the
number of motoneuron cell bodies touching blood vessels is
increased, accompanied by sprouting of vessels apparently
induced by HMGB1. This suggests that HMGB1 promotes
nervous system regeneration at least partly through facilitating
angiogenesis after SCI.
Taken together, our results indicate that HMGB1 enhances
functional recovery in adult zebrafish by stimulating
neurogenesis and increasing angiogenesis after severe complete
spinal cord transection. Studying the HMGB1 signaling path-
way in neurons and blood vessels in zebrafish after SCI and
overexpression of this molecule in endothelial cells can be
expected to delineate the protective function of HMGB1 in the
lesioned adult central nervous system not only of fish, but also of
mammals, with the hope to provide new approaches for therapy.
