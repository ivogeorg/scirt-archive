Introduction
In recent years, there have been nureticulospinal tract axons were traced in 6 rats by injecting BDA into the reticular formation. Transplants grew
tofill the lesion cavity inmost rats although graftsmadewith scar tissue removal had large central cavities. Grafts
blended extensively with host tissue obliterating the astroglial boundary at the cut ends, but in most cases there
was a well-defined partition within the graft that separated rostral and caudal parts of the graft. In some cases,
the partition contained non-neuronal scar tissue. There was extensive outgrowth of GFP labeled axons from
the graft, but there was minimal ingrowth of host axons into the graft revealed by tract tracing and immunocy-
tochemistry for 5HT. There were no statistically significant differences between transplant and control groups in
the degree of locomotor recovery. Our results confirm the previous report that NSC transplants can fill lesion
cavities and robustly extend axons, but reveal that most grafts do not create a continuous bridge of neural tissue
between rostral and caudal segments.

sev ie r .com/ locate /yexnra complete transection at thoracic level 3 (T3). Complete spinal cord
transections are considered the most stringent test of regenerative
strategies (Tuszynski and Steward, 2012).
We repeated key experiments in the original study to assess repro-
ducibility, focusing on the portion of the report that used freshly
order of surgery and the group assignments. A) one groupwas designat-
ed to receive transections only. B) one group was designated to receive
transections and then grafts 2 weeks later. It is important to note that
although the control group (A) did not receive any treatment at the
time rats in Group B received grafts, they were anesthetized and re-
ceived a skin incision that was closed with staples so that the experi-
menters could remain blind as to group identity. Six rats that received
transections and grafts received BDA injections into the reticular forma-
tion; grafted animals were randomly chosen from each squad using a
187K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204isolated NSCs from fetal rats. Our results confirm that NSC transplants
engraft and differentiate, although the extent of engraftment was
variable and depended on the method of transplant. Our results also
confirm remarkable axon outgrowth from NSC transplants. There was
only limited ingrowth of host axons, however. Assessments of locomo-
tor function did not reveal statistically significant differences between
transplanted and control groups. A completely unexpected finding
was that in about 50% of the rats, ectopic masses of graft-derived cells
were found at long distances from the transplant site including in the
brain. We report the existence of these ectopic colonies separately
(Steward et al., 2014). Our findings identify important issues relating
to the potential use of NSC transplants for therapy for severe SCI, includ-
ing a need to further refine transplantation techniques.
Materials and methods
Details regarding the way that the FORE-SCI Replication contracts
operate are summarized in perfect Steward et al., 2012. In brief, an inde-
pendent Scientific Advisory Committee for the contract reviews the lit-
erature and selects papers for replication. Selection factors include: 1)
Clinically-relevant endpoints (usually recovery of function); 2) Trans-
latability; 3) Effect size; and 4) Scientific quality of the target paper.
The Committee may select only part of the published study for replica-
tion (a particular set of experiments), and may recommend additional
control groups or analyses. Experiments that were not part of the orig-
inal paper, including additional control groups, are not supported by the
Contract unless recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee.
Here, the Committee selected the portion of Lu et al. (2012) involving
transplants of rat NSCs, with assessment of engraftment, axon
outgrowth from the graft, ingrowth of host axons, and assessment of
locomotor function.
Experimental animals were female Fischer 344 rats from Harlan Labs
that were 10–11 weeks old at the start of the experiments (the same
strain, sex, and age used by Lu et al.). Experimental protocols on spinal
cord injured rats were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) at theUniversity of California, Irvine. Rats genet-
ically engineered to express EGFP (F344-Tg(UBC-EGFP)F455Rrrc) were
obtained from the Rat Resource & Research Center (P40D011062) and
were bred locally to obtain embryos in the animal facilities at the
Veteran's Hospital San Diego. Procedures used to collect fetal NSCs
were approved by the IACUC at the Veteran's Hospital San Diego.
Every effort was made to duplicate procedures used by Lu et al. In
this regard, Dr. Lu consulted on the procedures and trained our surgical
staff. Because this is a surgical intervention, and as suchmay depend on
skills that can only bemastered by extensive experience,we felt that the
goals of the replication would be best-served if the same surgeon actu-
ally performed the transplants. Accordingly, Dr. Lu traveled to UCI to
perform the surgical procedures with the aid of our staff. Also, to insure
comparability of NSC transplants, the cells were harvested and prepared
in Dr. Lu's lab at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, San Diego
(VAMC) andwere delivered to UCI on the day of the grafting procedure.
We felt that this would be consistent with the goals of the replication
because the cells could be considered to be a “product” that was obtain-
ed for use as a therapeutic agent inmuch the sameway as a drug from a
commercial entity.
Overall experimental plan and group formulation
In the original study, transplantation surgeries were performed on
5–6 rats a day generating a total of 55 rats with full transection injuries.
There was no description in the original publication of how surgeries
were distributed over time, how rats were assigned to groups and
whether group assignment was random.
In our replication, rats were randomly assigned to 2 groups at the
time of the transection surgery. A studymember whowas not involved
in the behavioral assessment used a random generator to determine therandom number generator. Rats that received transections and grafts
and exhibited recovery of locomotor function received a secondary
full transection rostral to the original graft site 6 weeks post-
transplant. The schedule of surgeries is summarized in Table 1.
For Squad 1 (n= 6) the transection surgery sequence by treatment
groupwas B, B, B, B, A, B. The same group's sequence for transplantation
was B, B, A, B, B and B. Four of the six rats received graftswith removal of
scar tissue (Method 1, see below); one rat received 9-point injections
without scar removal (Method 2).
For Squad 2 (n= 6) the transection surgery sequence by treatment
groupwas A, B, B, B, B, B the same group's transplantation sequencewas
B, B, B, B, B and A. Grafts were done with scar removal (Method 1).
For Squad 3 (n= 9) the transection surgery sequence by treatment
group was A, B, A, B, A, A, B, B, B and the group's transplantation se-
quencewas B, A, B, A, A, B, B, B, A. Grafts were done using the 9-point in-
jections without scar removal (Method 2).
For Squad 4 (n = 8) the transection sequence by treatment group
was B, A, B, B, A, A, B, B and the group's transplantation sequence was
B, A, B, A, B, B, B, A. Grafts were done using the 9-point injections
without scar removal (Method 2).
Spinal cord injury
Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (67 mg/kg) and xylazine,
(0.7 mg/kg) and placed on a platform to eliminate movement. Respira-
tory pattern was monitored throughout the entire duration of the sur-
gery. A laminectomy was performed at thoracic level 3 (T3) and a
longitudinal 2 mm cut was made in the dura mater with a #11 blade.
Using irridectomy scissors (Roboz, Gaithersburg, MD: cat # RS-5619),
a 1.0–1.5 mm longitudinal block of spinal cord was cut on the right
side and removed by aspiration with a 23 G blunt needle leaving a
1.0–1.5mmgap. The same procedureswere performed on the left com-
pleting the full transection and the site was visually inspected under a
dissectingmicroscope to ensure that the transectionwas complete ven-
trally and laterally. Care was taken to preserve the dura mater so that
transplanted cells would be confined within the lesion cavity, and to
spare dorsal roots. After achieving hemostasis, overlying muscles were
sutured with 4–0 silk (Henry Schien, Dublin, Ohio, 100-6830) and
NeoPredef antibiotic powder (Western Medical Supply, Arcadia, CA,
94030)was applied, then the skinwas closed usingwound clips (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburg, PA).
Animal care
Following surgery, rats were placed in cages on water circulating
jacketed heating pads for the duration of the study. After recovering
from the anesthetic, animals were housed 3–4 per cage. After surgery,

188 K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204rats received lactated ringers (20 ml/kg, subcutaneously) every 6 h for
the first 3 days and then as needed. Rats also received banamine (Butler
Schein, Visalia, CA, cat #001846) (2 ml/kg, subcutaneously) every 12 h
for the first 3 days and subcutaneous injections of ampicillin (Western
Medical Supply, Arcadia, CA; cat #6127) 3 ml/kg every 24 h for the
first 14 days or until bladder function returned. For the entire duration
of the study, rats were given sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
(Butler Schein, Visalia, CA, cat #032455) (40 mg/8 mg per 1 mL) and
amoxicillin (Western Medical Supply, Arcadia, CA, #750) (50 mg/1 mL)
in drinking water (1–2 ml per 80–100 ml of water). The medicated
water was changed every 3 days. Bladders were expressed 2–3 times
daily by manual crede until reflex bladder function returned. Rats were
fed Nutri-Cal (Butler Schein, Visalia, CA; cat #000790) and DietGel
(ClearH2O, Portland, ME, cat #72-06-5022) for the first two weeks.
Staples were removed 14 days post grafting.
Rats weremonitored 2–3 times daily for general health, coat quality
(indicative of normal grooming activity) and mobility within the cage.
Rats with full transection injuries typically resume these activities 3–4
days following injury. In addition, signs of paralysis weremonitored, in-
cluding hindlimb paralysis, tail flaccidity, instability and uncoordinated
movement. Animalswere alsomonitored for signs of skin lesions on the
paralyzed limbs or autophagia of the toes (there were no skin lesions or
incidents of autophagia).
Cell preparation
Timed-pregnant female rats (Strain: F344-Tg(UBC-EGFP)F455Rrrc;
Rat Resource and Research Center Columbia, MO, RRRc# 00307) were
deeply anesthetized with an IP injection of Euthasol (100 mg/kg). The
abdominal cavity was opened under aseptic surgical conditions using
scissors and the uterus was removed and placed in a Petri dish with
cold PBS on ice. The damwas then sacrificed by performing a thoracot-
omy. A cut wasmade along the length of both uterine horns and embry-
os were removed and placed on a Petri dish with cold PBS on ice.
Embryo age was verified by the presence of clear lines separating the
digits of the developing forepaws. E13 digits are still fused and E13.5
are partially separated. A “NightSea” flashlight (Electron Microscopy
Sciences, Hatfield, PA, DFP-1) was used to identify GFP-positive embry-
os. One and one half GFP-positive E14 embryos were collected for each
rat to be transplanted.
For dissection, each embryo was placed in a dry Petri dish, the head
and tail were removed, and the embryo was positioned in a prone posi-
tionwith limbs extended. Usingmicro-scissors a cut wasmade through
the light transparent skin layer along the dorsal midline from neck to
tail, to expose the spinal cord. The ventral lamina and underlying tissue
was separated on both sides by gentle probing with fine micro-forceps
(Roboz, Gaithersburg, MD, RS5010# 55). The spinal cord was removed
and placed in a Petri dish with sterile saline. Under high magnification,
the duramater was removed using fine forceps and the spinal cord was
rinsed several times in fresh sterile saline
Dissociation of fetal spinal cord
Spinal cords were transferred to 15ml conical tubes containing 1ml
of ice cold HBSS (Calcium and Magnesium free) (Gibco, Grand Island,
NY, cat# 14175095), and 1 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY; cat# 25200056) was added bringing the final volume to 2
ml and final Trypsin concentration to 0.125%. Tubes were placed in a
37 °C water bath for 8–15 min. After incubation, 10 ml of DMEM
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY, 11995073) containing 10% FBS (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY, 16000044) was added to stop the trypsin reaction.
Tubes were centrifuged at 2500 RPM for 2 min, the supernatant was re-
moved, and 1ml of Neurobasal mediumwith 1:50 B27 growth promot-
ing supplement (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, 17504044) was added. The
pellet was gently re-suspended with a 1 ml pipet-man and large sterile
pipet tip, and then afire polished Pasteur pipetwith large borewas usedto triturate the cell suspension. Re-suspension was continued by tritu-
rating with progressively smaller diameter fire polished pipettes, and
cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 RPM for 2 min. The super-
natant was removed and the pellet was re-suspended in 1–2 ml of
Neurobasal medium then filtered through 45 μm cell strainer and
collected into a sterile 50 ml tube. All of the above procedures were
performed at VAMC and required approximately 2 h per preparation.
Immediately prior to transplantation, cells were counted on a
cytometer, pelleted at 2500 RPM for 2 min, then re-suspended at a
final concentration of 250,000 cells/μl in a fibrin and thrombin cocktail.
The fibrin and thrombin/cocktail/cell mixture was loaded in separate
glass pulled pipettes. Injection parameters are described below.
Preparation of fibrogen/thrombin/cocktail
The growth factor cocktail contained the following agents: recombi-
nant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 50 μg/ml,
Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ; cat 452–02), recombinant human
neurotrophin-3 (NT-3, 50 μg/ml, Peprotech,-03), calpain inhibitor III
(MDL28170, 50 μM, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, M6690), human
platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA, 10 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich,
P3076), mouse insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1, 10 μg/ml, Sigma
Aldrich, I8779), murine epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 μg/ml,
Sigma Aldrich, E1257), basic human fibroblast growth factor (bFGF,
10 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, F0291), acidic human fibroblast growth factor
(aFGF, 10 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, F5542), rat glial cell line-derived neuro-
trophic factor (GDNF, 10 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, G1401), and human he-
patocyte growth factor (HGF, 10 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, H9661). Each
original agent was reconstituted in 1×phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). Rat fibrinogen (100 mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, F6755) and 1×PBS
were combined with the growth factor cocktail and made into aliquots
with a final concentration of 25 mg/ml. Rat thrombin (100 U/ml, Sigma
Aldrich, T5772) and 10mMCaCl2 was combinedwith the growth factor
cocktail and made into aliquots with a final concentration of 25 U/ml.
One aliquot of rat fibrinogen/growth factor cocktail (25 mg/ml) and
one aliquot of rat thrombin/growth factor cocktail (25 U/ml) were
used on the day of transplantation surgeries.
Grafting procedures
Two weeks post injury rats were re-anesthetized with ketamine/
xylazine as above. Rats were placed in a stereotaxic device with a tail
clamp, the skin over the laminectomy site was incised, and muscle
and scar tissue were dissected to expose the original laminectomy site
taking care not to reinjure the dura mater and spinal cord.
In the original study, two different methods were used for grafting.
This was not reported in their Methods section, but was communicated
to us by the original author. The original authors felt that it was impor-
tant to use both methods in our replication experiment so that there
could be a direct comparison. The major difference between the two
methods is that in Method 1, scar tissue was removed prior to
transplant.
Method 1
The dura mater was incised and scar tissue was carefully aspirated
creating a cavity without injuring the spinal cord (Fig. 1). Then 3.0 μl
of the fibrogen/cocktail/cells was injected into the epicenter of the
lesion using a Picospritzer (Parker, Hollis, NH,052-0500-900) and a
preformed gel made out of 50 μg/ml of fibrin and 50 g/μl of thrombin
was placed over the cavity. Then 0.375 μl thrombin/cocktail/cells was
injected into eight sites (two sites lateral to the epicenter and three
sites rostral and three sites caudal to the epicenter) (Fig. 1).
Method 2
A series of nine holes were made in the dura mater (Fig. 1) using a
31 cm insulin syringe with a 30Ga needle. Three holes were rostral to

center. Each hole was expanded until the ventral spinal column was
identified leaving the scar tissue intact, taking care not to damage the

along with a preformed fibrin/thrombin gel. In Method 2, cells were injected through smaintact spinal cord (Fig. 1). Using a Picospritzer, 1.5 μl of fibrogen/cock-
tail/cells was injected into the central site at epicenter, 1.0 μl was
injected in the two lateral points at the epicenter and 0.33 μl was
injected into each site rostral and caudal to the epicenter. Then the
same procedure was repeated with the mixture of thrombin/cocktail/
cells.
Each of the transplantationmethods delivered approximately 6–7 μl
of fibrin/thrombin/cocktail/cells mixture into the lesion site and ap-
proximately 250,000 cells per μl for a total of approximately 1.5 × 106
cells per graft. Nine rats were injected using Method 1; eleven were
injected using Method 2 (see Table 2).
After achieving hemostasis, overlyingmuscles were sutured and the
skin was closed using wound clips as described above. Post-operative
care was as described above.
Timing of procedures
NSC's were harvested in the morning at VAMC between approxi-
mately 7 and 9 AM. The cells were transported to UCI on ice, where
the first transplant surgery was carried out at about 11 AM, with
other rats receiving transplants at intervals of approximately 30 min.
Transplants were done on 4 different days. The number of rats that re-
ceived transplants on particular days and the timing of transplant
delivery for individual rats is shown in Table 2.
Re-transection of the spinal cord
Nine weeks post injury two rats with transplants that exhibited lo-
comotor recovery received a secondary full transection. For this, rats
were re-anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, the skin was incised
and muscle and scar tissue were carefully dissected to expose the orig-
inal laminectomy site paying special attention not to re-injure the dura
mater and spinal cord. The spinal cordwas transected rostral to the graftwith a #11 scalpel blade, and the sitewas visually inspected under a dis-
sectingmicroscope to ensure that the transectionwas complete ventral-
ly and laterally. After achieving hemostasis, overlying muscles were

Post-operative care was as described above.
BDA injections
Nineweeks post lesion, six rats received bilateral injections of biotin
dextran amine (BDA) (Molecular probes, Carlsbad, CA, D1956; 10% in
saline) into the reticular formation to label descending reticulospinal
axons (Jin et al., 2002). These rats were randomly chosen by a random

Brains from rats that did not receive BDA were sectioned in the coronal
plane at 20 μm or 40 μm and sections at 100–120 μm intervals were
immunostained for GFP.

Injection X (M/L) Y (A/P) Z (D/V)Rats were euthanized 9–10 weeks post-injury via injection of
Euthasol (100 mg/kg), and were perfused transcardially with 4% para-
formaldehyde in 0.1Mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Spinal cords and brains
were removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phos-
phate buffer, pH 7.4 at 4 °C overnight and were then cryo-protected in
27% sucrose.
A 15mmblock of spinal cord containing the lesionwas embedded in
OCT Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek, USA Inc., 25608–930) and frozen. Cryo-
stat sections were taken in the horizontal plane at 30 μm, and sections
were collected in serial order in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide. For
each stain described below, every 6th section was taken to create a se-
ries that spanned the depth of each spinal cord with 180 μm between
sections. Blocks of the spinal cord at spinal levels C2, C4, C6, C8, T6, T8,
T10, T12, L1/2, and L4 were sectioned in the transverse plane at 20 μm.
For rats that received a BDA injection, brainswere prepared as above
and sectioned at 20 μm thickness in the coronal plane. Sections at
200 μm intervals were stained for BDA to document the injection sites.Following spinal cord injury, deficits in bladder function are
reflected by an inability to empty the bladder, which can be quantified
by measuring the volume of urine retained in the bladder. To assess
urine retention, expressed urine was collected and weighed once each
week during the routine bladder expression in the morning.
Hindlimb locomotor function (BBB)
Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed with the BBB locomotor
rating scale (Basso et al., 1995). BBB testing was carried out prior to
injury and onceweekly for sevenweeks post-injury. Baseline testing oc-
curred twice prior to injury. For testing, ratswere placed in an open field
(a galvanized stock tank that was 105 cm in diameter with 30 cm high
walls) for 4 min. The BBB is a 0–22-point scale designed to assess hind
limb locomotor recovery after injury to the thoracic spinal cord. This
scale provides a measure of hindlimb function ranging from complete
paralysis to normal locomotion by assessing hind limb joint move-
ments, stepping, trunk position and stability, forelimb–hindlimb coordi-
nation, paw placement, toe clearance, and tail position. Rat's bladders
were expressed manually 20–25 min prior to testing in the open field.
BBB testing was done just after animal care in the morning, and so
there was typically only a small amount of expressible urine at the
time of BBB testing. Hindlimb movement and locomotion were scored
simultaneously by two observers (both blind to the treatment groups)
who focused on different sides of the animal.Spinal cord sections were analyzed to assess lesion characteristics,
extent of engraftment, and where BDA was involved, BDA labeling.
Sets of horizontal sections from rats that did not receive grafts were
stained for GFAP to define the region of activated astrocytes, and neuro-
filament to assesswhether therewere surviving axons at the injury site.
One set of sections from rats with transplants was stained for GFP only
to allow for quantitative assessment of GFP-positive fibers extending
into the host tissue. Sets of sections were also co-stained for GFP to
label the graft and GFAP to define the region of activated astrocytes, or
co-stained with GFP and SMI-312 (neurofilament). Representative sec-
tions from some animals were immunostained for cell type-specific
markers NeuN, APC, or Iba1 to characterize the graft composition. Sec-
tions from rats that received BDA were stained for BDA to visualize
the labeled reticulospinal axons in the spinal cord.
For immunostaining, sections taken at 180 μm intervals through the
lesions or cross-sections of spinal cord and brain were washed in TBS,
blocked in TBS with 0.1–0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey or
goat serum, then incubated overnight in primary antibody cocktails
containing as needed, rabbit anti GFP 1:1500 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
A-11122), mouse anti GFAP 1:1000 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
G-3893), mouse anti SMI-312 for neurofilament 1:1000 (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK, ab24574), rabbit anti-5-HT 1:1000 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, S-5545), mouse anti-MAP2 1:500 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, M9942), mouse anti APC 1:400 (Oncogene, LaJolla, CA, OP80-
100UG), mouse anti NeuN 1:200 (Millipore, Burlington, MA, MAB377),
rabbit anti Iba1 1:1000 (Wako, Osaka Japan, 019-19741). Sections were
washed in TBS, and then incubatedwith Alexafluor conjugated secondary
antibodies diluted 1:250 in TBSwith 5%normal donkey or goat serum. For
GFP and 5-HT, donkey anti-rabbit Alexafluor 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, A-21206) or Alexafluor 594, for GFAP, MAP2 APC, NeuN, and
SMI312 and, donkey anti-mouse Alexafluor 594 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, A-21203), 5HT and Iba1 was used. Following washes, sections were
stained in 1 μg/ml Hoescht 33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, H-
3569) for 5 min, washed in TBS, and mounted in serial order on gelatin
subbed slides. Slides were coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Labora-
tories, Burlingame, CA, H-1000).
For GFP immunostaining, free-floating sections were washed in TBS,
treated in 1% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min, washed again in TBS, then
blocked in TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey serum.
Sections were incubated in rabbit anti-GFP 1:1500 (Invitrogen, Carls-
bad, CA, A-11122) overnight, washed in TBS, then incubated with don-
key ant-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, 711-036-152) 1:250 1–2 h. Sections
werewashed in TBS and reactedwith nickel enhancedDAB (Vector Lab-
oratories, Burlingame, CA, PK4100), rinsed, then mounted on gelatin-
subbed slides. Slideswere dehydrated through graded ethanols, cleared
in Xylenes, and coverslipped with DPX.
To co-stain for BDA and GFP, sections were washed in TBS with 0.1%
Triton X-100, blocked in TBS with 5% normal donkey serum, then
incubatedwith streptavidin-Alexafluor 594 1:250 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, S-11227) and rabbit anti-GFP 1:1500 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
A-11122) overnight. Sections were washed in TBS, and incubated with
donkey anti-rabbit Alexafluor 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, A-21206)
diluted 1:250 in TBS with 5% normal donkey serum. Sections were
washed in TBS, mounted on gelatin-subbed slides, and coverslipped
with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, H-1000).
(see Table 4 for histological summary).
Quantification of GFP-labeled axons
To determine the number of GFP-positive axons extending from the
graft, we assessed axons in one set of horizontal sections taken at
180 μm intervals. A line was drawn from one side to the other in each
horizontal section 500 μm caudal to the graft/host interface. GFP-
labeled axons crossing this line were marked and counted under
600×magnification.

191K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204Quantification of GFP-labeled axon density
Images were captured under 40×magnification 500 μm caudal to
the graft/host interface. Using ImageJ software, the threshold was
adjusted so that GFP-labeled axons were above threshold. The same
threshold was used for each image for all the animals. Measurements
were then taken in each section of the series taken at 180 μm intervals.
The axon densities were summed and divided by the number of
sections. Data are expressed as pixels/unit area.
Statistical evaluation
In all quantification procedures and behavioral analyses, observers
were blinded to treatment groups. Multiple group comparisons were
made using one-way analyses of variance. Two-group comparisons
were tested by Student's t-test. Analyses were performed using Graph
Pad Prism (La Jolla, CA).
Results
Rats received spinal cord injuries on 4 separate days over a period of
two weeks (termed Squad 1–4). On each surgery day, rats were ran-
domly assigned to grafted or lesion only control groups as described
in the Methods. Table 5 summarizes the numbers for each squad, and
attrition due to all causes, and removal from the study.
Attrition and final group numbers
Of the 7 rats that received T3 transections on 4/23/13, one was
removed from the study because of incomplete paralysis (BBB greater
than 7 at 14 days post-lesion). Five of the remaining rats received trans-
plants, and one was a non-transplant control. One of the transplanted
rats received a BDA injection, and one received a secondary re-
transection. None of the rats died during or following the injury, trans-
plantation, tract tracing or re-transection surgeries.
Of the 7 rats that received T3 transections on 4/26/13, one rat died
post injury. Five rats received transplants, and one was a non-
transplant control. Oneof the transplanted rats received a BDA injection,
but died at the time of this procedure. Tissue was collected from this
animal and was included in the E14 grafted group for histological and
behavioral analysis. Another received a secondary re-transection, but
was euthanized and perfused 2 days after the secondary lesion due to
poor health. We included data from this rat in the histological and
behavioral analysis.
Of the 10 rats that received T3 transections on 4/30/13, one was re-
moved from the study because of incomplete paralysis. Of the remain-
ing rats, 5 rats received transplants, and 4 were non-transplant
controls. Two of the transplanted rats received BDA injections, and
one rat died at the time of this procedure. We were able to perfuse the
rat that died so data from this rat are included in the histological and
behavioral analysis.
Of the 11 rats that received T3 transections on 5/2/13, three rats died
1-day post injury. Five rats received transplants, and 3 were non-
transplant controls. Two of the transplanted rats received BDA injec-
tions. None of the rats died during or following transplantation or
tract tracing.
In optimal cases, NSC grafts survive and expand to fill the lesion cavity
Fig. 2 illustrates examples of lesion sites in non-grafted control rats
and rats that received transplants. These are horizontal sections that
were immunostained for GFAP (in the case of the non-grafted controls)
and co-stained for GFAP and GFP in the case of sections from rats that
received transplants.
In non-grafted controls, the stumps of the spinal cord at the lesion
site were capped with a glial/connective tissue scar and GFAP staining

192 K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204was highly elevated in the zones adjacent to the lesion margins
(Fig. 2A). Non-neural scar tissue (GFAP negative) was present in the le-
sion site in a trabecular network, and GFAP-positive processes extended
partially into the scar tissue. In none of the caseswas there evidence of a
spared bridge of neural tissue (that is, tissue containing GFAP-positive
astrocyte processes). Thus, in all control cases, lesions were judged to
be complete transections. Because thesewere horizontal sections, how-
ever, we cannot exclude the possibility of some spared axons in the
most ventral part of the spinal cord.
In all rats that received grafts, the lesion site contained graft-derived
tissue although some grafts had large central cavities (more on this
below). Figs. 2B–E illustrate a graft that closely resembles the grafts
shown in Lu et al. Here, horizontal sections from near the central core
of the spinal cord were immunostained for GFAP (red fluorescence)
and for GFP (green fluorescence) to reveal the grafted tissue. The grafts
had a different morphology than host spinal cord in that they appeared
disorganized and lobulated. Immunostaining for GFAPwas higher in the
region of the host tissue adjacent to the junction betweenhost and graft,
but not as high as in the regions adjacent to the lesion margin in non-
grafted controls (compare Figs. 2B with A). It is noteworthy that this
and other grafts expanded to form a structurewith roughly the samedi-
ameter as the normal spinal cord. Also, the grafts adhered to host tissue
without interposed cavities or scar tissue, and graft-derived tissue
(GFP-positive) blended extensively with the host tissue of the rostral
and caudal stumps so that there was not a distinct boundary between
graft and host and the astroglial boundary at the ends of the host tissue
was largely obliterated.
Variability in engraftment
The graft illustrated in Fig. 2 closely resembles the grafts shown in Lu
et al. There was, however, variability in the extent of engraftment. Fig. 3
illustrates 18 of the 20 cases in the present study; the two rats that re-
ceived secondary transections are not shown because the transections
damaged the grafts. Each panel illustrates a horizontal section taken
near themidpoint of the spinal cord. Numbers indicate animal numbers
represented in Tables. The 10 grafts shown in panels I–R resemble the
grafts shown in Lu et al., in that the grafts fill the lesion site and blend
with host tissue rostral and caudal to the lesion. In contrast, the 8 grafts
shown in A–H have internal cavities of varying sizes and/or fail to
completely fill in the lesion site. It is noteworthy that all of the animals
shown in panels I–R were transplanted by Method 2, whereas the rats
shown in panels A–H were transplanted by Method 1, which involved
removal of scar tissue and implantation of a preformed fibrin/thrombin
gel.
There was no obvious relationship between extent of engraftment
and the time after cell isolation (Table 3). For example, grafts in rat
#25 and 26 filled the lesion site, although #25 received its graft 1.7 h
after cell isolation whereas #26 received its graft late in the day 6.4 h
post-isolation.
The extent of integration of grafts with host
We use the term “integration” to refer to the extent to which the
graft grows to closely appose and intermingle with the host tissue at
the rostral and caudal stumps so that there is no sharp boundary be-
tween graft and host. Figs. 2B–C illustrates a graft that is well-
integrated with host tissue on both rostral and caudal sides. In sections
immunostained for GFP using DAB as the chromogen (Fig. 3), integra-
tion appears even more extensive because of the large number of GFP-
positive axons that extend from the grafts. By the above definition,
most grafts were well-integrated with host tissue on both rostral and
caudal sides, even when there were large cavities in the core of the
graft. In two grafts, there was a sharp boundary between graft and
host tissue on the caudal end of the graft (#12, Fig. 3G and number
193K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–20431, Fig. 3Q). Evenwith the sharply definedmargin, however, manyGFP-
positive axons extend from the graft (more on this below).
The presence of partitions within the grafts
An unexpected finding was that most grafts had a single transverse
partition in the core of the graft, often near the middle of the graft
(Figs. 2B&C, white arrow). Immunostaining for GFAP was high on both
sides of the partition (Figs. 2D&E). Partitions of this sort were not re-
ported by Lu et al. In the graft shown in Figs. 2D&E, there was no sepa-
ration between the GFAP-rich zones on each side of the partition, and
there appeared to be some intermixing of glial processes across the par-
tition. In 4 other rats, the grafts resembled the one shown in Figs. 2B–E
(see Table 6) in that there was a transverse partition within the graft,
but there was not a large separation at the partition. In other cases,

tissue, creating greater separation between rostral and caudal portions
of the grafts (Figs. 4A&B). No GFAP-positive processes extended into
this non-neural tissue. Assessment of the full series of horizontal sec-
tions taken at 180 μm intervals revealed that the partition was present
throughout the dorso-ventral extent of the spinal cord. Most partitions
were oriented in the transverse plane and were continuous in a more
or less straight line from one side of the spinal cord to the other. Parti-
tions with non-neuronal scar tissue were seen in 9 rats (Table 6). The
presence of the partitionswith non-neural scar tissue invites the specu-
lation that the grafts on each side of the partition grew and differentiat-
ed, but that there was no fusion of the rostral and caudal parts of the
graft to create a continuous bridge of neural tissue.
In 2 cases (Rat #3 and 18) the partition appeared to be bridged by
graft tissue (Figs. 4C&D). Notches indicating a partition can be seen on

cord, the graft appears to have perforated the partition to form a contin-
uous framework of GFAP-positive neural tissue between rostral and
caudal stumps. Other features of this case are that the graft extends fur-
ther into the caudal than the rostral stump, and the caudal boundary of
the graft appears more distinct than the rostral boundary of this graft or
the boundaries in other cases (Fig. 4C). Indeed, the caudal end of the
graft appears to be somewhat encapsulated by GFAP-positive processes,
some of which are oriented parallel to the graft margin. The boundary
here appeared quite different, however, from the partitions containing

196 K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204It is a reasonable minimal requirement that functional benefits of a
graft (in terms of locomotor function) would depend on the degree to
which the graft creates a bridge between rostral and caudal segments.
Accordingly, Table 6 summarizes the 4 patterns of engraftment based
on this criterion. Category 1 grafts have at least a partial tissue bridge
between rostral and caudal segments; Category 2 grafts have a partition
with some intermixing of astroglial processes across the partition;
Category 3 grafts have a partition containing non-neuronal tissue, and
Category 4 grafts have large cavities.
Native GFP fluorescence of grafts
The sections illustrated in Figs. 2–4A–Bwere immunostained for GFP
to reveal the graft, but even without immunostaining, native GFP fluo-
rescence was evident. Fig. 5C illustrates native GFP fluorescence from
an unstained section from the same case shown in Fig. 2C imaged for
3.974 s, which is 8×longer than for the immunostained sections in
Fig. 2. When the exposure interval was the same as used for immuno-
stained sections (0.496 s), native GFP fluorescence was barely detect-
able (Fig. 5D). Although native GFP fluorescence was relatively low, it
limited our ability to visualize green immunofluorescence of elements
within the main body of the graft (more on this below).
Cell types within the grafts
Horizontal sections from representative cases were immunostained
with cell type-specific markers. Fig. 6 illustrates pairs of images of

and E) and the same section imaged for red fluorescence for NeuN,
APC IBA1 and GFAP (Figs. 6B, D, F and H respectively). Immunostaining
for NeuN (Fig. 6B) revealed small to medium-sized neurons within
the transplant with processes resembling dendrites. Immunostaining
for APC (a marker for oligodendrocytes) revealed small-medium
sized cells within the transplant with the same general morphology as
APC-positive cells within the host parenchyma (Fig. 6D). Immunostain-
ing for IBA1 (amarker formicroglia) revealed ramified cells with amor-
phology similar to microglia in the host parenchyma (Fig. 6 F).
Immunostaining for GFAP revealed ramified astrocytes with amorphol-
ogy similar to astrocytes in the host parenchyma (Fig. 6H and see also
Fig. 2).
Ectopic cell masses
Another surprising discovery was that ectopic colonies of GFP-
positive graft derived cells were present at long distances from the
graft in many rats. We reported the presence of colonies elsewhere
(Steward et al., 2014), but note their existence here because they com-
plicate interpretation of the origin of graft-derived axons (see below).
Ectopic colonies were found in the central canal caudal to the graft, on
the surface of the spinal cord, and in the fourth ventricle of the
brainstem. In total, ectopic colonies were found in half the rats that
received transplants (Steward et al., 2014).

197K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204Assessment of axon outgrowth from the grafts
One of the most dramatic findings in the original study by Lu et al.
was extraordinarily robust and long-distance outgrowth of axons from
the NSC grafts into the host spinal cord. Our results fully confirmed
these findings. As noted by Lu et al., GFP labeled axons could be seen
most clearly in sections that had been immunostained for GFP using
DAB as the chromogen. Fig. 7 illustrates examples from rat #25, which
had Category 2 morphology (see Table 6). GFP-labeled axons streamed
out of the graft rostrally and caudally (Fig. 7A) extending longitudinally
to both the rostral and caudal ends of the 15 mm long block containing
the injury site. Some axons extended longitudinally along white matter
tracts in a generally straight trajectory, giving off collaterals that entered
the gray matter. Axons also extended within the gray matter with a
more tortuous course; these had numerous varicosities along their
length suggestive of en passant presynaptic boutons. Fig. 7B illustrates
axons in the lateral column and gray matter about 500 μm caudal to

axons at the caudal end of the block. GFP-positive cells with the
morphology of highly ramified astrocytes were also evident in the
host spinal cord about 1–2 mm distant from the edge of the graft
(Fig. 7A, arrow). Extensive axon outgrowth can be appreciated in the
low power images in Fig. 3. Axon outgrowth was extensive from both
rostral and caudal ends of the grafts in 8 of 10 of the cases where
the grafts filled the injury site (rat #16, 18, 22, 23, 5, 26, 28, and 32,
see Fig. 3). In the other 2 cases in this group (#24 and 31), axon out-
growth was extensive from the rostral end of the graft, but not the cau-
dal (note sharp boundary between graft and host on the caudal end).
Even in the cases with cavitation (Figs. 3A–H) there was extensive
axon outgrowth.
We counted GFP positive axons at a distance of 500 μm in one rat
(#25) in the same way described by Lu et al. There were a total of
48,420 axons, which is actually higher than the value of 29,000 reported
by Lu et al. It was our impression that other rats had as many or even
rizontal sections thatwere imaged for nativeGFP to reveal the graft (A,C,E,G) and the same
198 K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204more GFP-labeled axons extending from the grafts (Fig. 6), but we did
not count axons in other cases.
GFP-labeled axons were also evident in cross-sections taken at low
cervical and at thoracic levels below the lesion block. In general, axon
density decreased with distance from the graft, but there were halos
of GFP-positive axons surrounding the ectopic colonies in the central
canal (Figs. 7D&F). The presence of ectopic colonies of graft-derived
cells makes it difficult to determine with certainty whether axons at a
particular site originated from themain body of the graft or from the ec-
topic colonies. For example, Figs. 7D&E illustrate a halo of axons around

horizontal sections. High magnification views (Fig. 7F) indicate
that there were also small GFP-positive masses in the central canal
at C8. There were also nests of GFP-labeled axons in the lateral
ventral horn (Fig. 7E) that appeared to decorate large dendrites. Co-
immunostaining for GFP and MAP2 (a dendrite-specific cytoskeletal
protein) confirmed the association between GFP-positive axons and
dendrites (Fig. 7G). The size and orientation of the dendrites makes it
likely that they are from motoneurons. The presence of displaced cell
masses makes it impossible to determine whether GFP-labeled axons

plant or derived from the ectopic colonies. Certainly, the halo of axons
centered on the central canal (Fig. 7D) likely originate in part from the
ectopic cell masses in the central canal.
Assessment of growth of host axons into the grafts
BDA-labeled reticulospinal axons
In rats that received BDA injections into the reticular formation, large
numbers of axons were labeled in the lateral and ventral columns rostral
to the lesion, with extensive collaterals that extended into the gray mat-
ter. Figs. 8A–D illustrate examples of horizontal sections from two rats.
Although BDA-labeled axonswere numerous rostral to the lesion, few ex-
tended past the host–graft boundary; instead, most ended in structures
resembling retraction balls near the graft/host interface. A few BDA la-
beled axons did enter areas occupied by GFP-positive cells, but because
the graft/host boundary is indistinct, it was not clear whether these actu-
ally entered the body of the graft or instead only extended into areas of
the host spinal cord occupied by graft-derived cells. In any case, the
axons that extended into GFP-positive domains formed small terminal

arbors (Fig. 8E). Some of the axons that extended into GFP-positive do-
mains originated as collateral branches from near retraction balls
(Fig. 8E). The fact that a few reticulospinal axons enter the graft and
form terminal arbors confirms the findings of Lu et al., although on bal-
ance, it is the lack of extension into the graft that is more striking.
BDA-labeled reticulospinal axons did not enter the ectopic colonies
of cells in the central canal at cervical levels (Fig. 8G). Native GFP fluo-
rescence of the colony of transplant-derived cells is shown in the
same section in Fig. 8H.
5HT
Sets of horizontal sections from 4 rats (5, 24, 31, 32) were immuno-
stained for 5HT using Alexafluor-488 to generate green fluorescence.
Green fluorescent axons were evident in the host spinal cord in the ex-
pected distribution for 5HT-containing axons. In addition, some green
fluorescent axons could be seen in the main body of the graft. Because
of the native GFP fluorescence, however, we could not be certain that
these axons originated from the host. No other sets of sections were
available from rat #5, 24, 31, and 32 because these rats were used for
BDA tracing. Accordingly, sections from 4 other rats (12, 22, 23, 26)
were immunostained for 5HTusing Alexafluor-594 to generate redfluo-
rescence. Red fluorescent axons could be seen in the expected distribu-
tion of 5HT axons above the injury/graft and were also present in the
portion of the host spinal cord that contained graft-derived cells
(Figs. 9B&C, arrow). These appeared to stream from the areas containing
high numbers of host 5HT axons. Some of the axons that extended into
GFP-positive domains formed terminal arborswith varicosities suggest-
ing en passant synapses.
Surprisingly, there were also 5HT positive axons caudal to the graft
(Fig. 9D). These were concentrated within about 1 mm of the graft
boundary, but a few5HT positive axons extended for severalmmcaudal
to the graft (Fig. 9D). Initially, we assumed that 5HTpositive axonswere
from the host, but we were surprised to discover large 5HT positive cell
bodies within the graft itself, which had a neuronal morphology
(Fig. 9E). Red fluorescent cells were present within the graft in all 4 of
the rats that were immunostained for 5HT using Alexafluor-594. In ad-
dition, green fluorescent cells with similar morphology were also pres-
ent in the rats that were immunostained for 5HT using Alexafluor-488.
5HT-positive neurons were thus present in the grafts in all 8 rats that
were immunostained for 5HT, making it likely that 5HT positive neu-
rons were present in most if not all of the grafts.
The 5HT-positive cells shown in Fig. 9E are rostral to the transverse
partition evident in Fig. 9A (this is a category 3 graft), but large 5HT pos-
itive cellswith neuronalmorphologywere also present in the part of the
graft that is caudal to the partition (not shown). The presence of 5HT
positive cellswith neuronalmorphology in the graftmakes it impossible
to determine whether the 5HT positive axons that extend past the le-
sion into caudal segments are from the host or from neurons in the
graft. The latter is more likely, however because there were no 5HT-
positive axons crossing through the partition. Nevertheless, when we
imaged the region caudal to the graft for both 5HT andGFP fluorescence,
no double-labeled axons were detected. This means either that the 5HT
positive axons actually did arise from the host or that the 5HT axons
did not express GFP at sufficiently high levels to be detectable.
Thus, the question of the origin of the 5HT axons caudal to the graft
remains open.

Probable stroke in one grafted rat
In our analysis of brains of rats that received NSC transplants, we
were surprised to find one rat with a large cerebral infarct. The infarct
had a form and distribution consistent with a stroke resulting from oc-
clusion of a major branch of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). BBB
scores of this animal (#2) suddenly declined 2 weeks after grafting,
which may indicate the time of the stroke. Data from this animal were
excluded from the functional analyses.
Functional assessments
BBB analyses of hindlimb locomotor function
In the original study, Lu et al. report that rats that received full tran-
sections and no transplants had little hindlimb movement for the dura-
tion of the experiment (BBB 0–2), whereas rats with successful NSC
grafts showed improved motor function beginning two weeks post
graft with continued improvement up to 6 weeks. Average BBB scores
at 42 days post transplantation/graftwere approximately 1.5 for controls

not explicitly reported. Here we present data for all rats, and then sub-
one joint and slight movement of one other joint. Our transplant
group averaged 2.8 on the BBB at 7 weeks post-transplant whereas
202 K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204the average final BBB scores in Lu et al. were 6.5. There were no signifi-
cant differences between our groups by repeated measures ANOVA
(F = 0.07, p = 0.80), but changes over time were significant
(F = 423.00, p b 0.0001). Fig. 10B illustrates a scatterplot of BBB scores
at 5 weeks post transplantation/graft. 6 rats in the transplant group had
higher BBB scores in the 6–7 range.
Our understanding was that Lu et al. only included rats in the BBB
analyses in which grafts met particular criteria. Our understanding of
his communicationswas that rats were only included “if grafts were ad-
herent to thehost overmore than 1/3 of their circumference bilaterally”.
It was not clear to us how this criterion was applied in practice even
after extensive discussions with Dr. Lu. Accordingly, functional data
from our experiments were analyzed according to the categories de-
fined above (Fig. 10C); there were no significant differences between
groups by repeated measures ANOVA (F = 0.57, p = 0.69).
Two different surgical techniques were used at the time of grafting;
thus, we were curious whether functional outcome differed depending
on themethod of grafting. To test this, datawere analyzed separately for
rats that received transplants with and without removal of scar tissue.
As illustrated in Fig. 10D, BBB scores did not differ significantly depend-
ing on the method of transplantation (F = 0.25, p = 0.79).
Finally, we asked Dr. Lu to score our grafts using the criteria that he
had communicated to us. It was discovered that only 4 of our rats met
his inclusion criteria. When BBB scores were analyzed based on Dr. Lu's
scoring, there were also no differences between groups (Fig. 10E).
Fig. 10 F illustrates the two rats that were re-transected at 6 weeks
post injury. Prior to re-transection, the average BBB was 6, indicating
extensive movement of two joints and slight movement of a
third. After the re-transection, rats were severely impaired with an av-
erage BBB score of 1.25, which indicates slight movement of one or
two joints.
Assessment of bladder function
Given the importance of bladder function for people with SCI
(Anderson, 2004) we also assessed whether transplant/grafting treat-
ment affected bladder function. A useful measure of bladder function is
the amount of retained urine, determined by collecting urine at the time
of bladder expression (Fig. 10G). There were no significant differences
between groups by repeated measures ANOVA (F = 0.015, p = 0.90),
but changes over time were significant (F = 6.39, p b 0.0001).
Body weight as an assessment of overall health
Progressive weight gain following SCI is considered to be a sign
of good health. All groups gained weight over the course of the ex-
periment (F = 131.7, p b 0.0001) and there were no significant dif-
ferences between groups by repeated measures ANOVA (F = 1.18,divide groups based on the features of the grafts.
Average BBB scores over days for all rats are shown in Fig. 10. It was
noteworthy that the initial deficit was less than reported by Lu et al.
Their average BBB scores at 7 weeks post-lesion in the control group
were 1.5 whereas ours were 2.6. The extent of recovery of hindlimb lo-
comotor function was slightly more in our control group than reported
by Lu et al. By the end of the testing period, control rats were on average
capable of extensive movement of one joint or extensive movement ofand 6.5 for grafted rats (estimated from graph in Fig. 5 of Lu et al.). These
differences were statistically significant by t-tests on the last 4 testing
sessions (3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks post-graft). Our Understanding from com-
municationswith Dr. Luwas that in their study, rats were excluded post-
hoc from the behavioral assessments if histological assessment revealed
that grafts did not meet defined criteria (see below), although this wasp = 0.29).Discussion
The original report of Lu et al. was remarkable and exciting because
of the reported long-distance growth of axons from the graft, ingrowth
of host axons, which could form a relay circuit, and five-point improve-
ment on the BBB scale reflecting recovery of the ability tomove all joints
of the hindlimbs. Of these 3 key findings, our results confirmed only the
long-distance outgrowth of axons from the graft. We did not confirm
extensive ingrowth of host axons into the graft or enhanced locomotor
recovery in rats that received grafts.
Other aspects of the original report were that freshly isolated NSC's
from E14 rats that are treatedwith growth-factor enriched fibrinmatrix
expand to completely fill the hole left at the injury site, integrating ex-
tensively with host tissue. Our results confirmed these findings. Never-
theless, growth factor treated NSCs are not unique in this regard.
Transplants of fetal tissue have been shown to expand to fill lesion cav-
ities and integrate extensively with host tissue (Reier et al., 1986). Also,
transplants of either “E14 fetal stem cells” (actually small pieces of
freshly-dissected E14 spinal cords), or lineage-restricted neural precur-
sors that were derived by culturing cells from E13.5 rats under defined
conditions, can also expand to fill smaller cavities created by partial spi-
nal cord lesions (Lepore and Fischer, 2005).
Our results extend the original study by showing that grafts made
using Method 2 completely filled the lesion cavity and blended exten-
sively with the host tissue, whereas grafts made using Method 1 often
contained large cavities. Also, most grafts made with either method
contained a transverse partition that formed a complete boundary be-
tween rostral and caudal ends of the transplants. Taken together, our
findings support cautious continuation of development of NSC trans-
plants as a potential therapy for severe SCI, but also reveal that reliable
functional benefits remain to be demonstrated and that there are signif-
icant barriers to formation of a continuous bridge of neural tissue be-
tween rostral and caudal segments. The failure to replicate key aspects
of the original report emphasizes the need for cautious interpretation
of the impact of findings using this and similar approaches.
Methodological issues
Every attempt wasmade to duplicate methods used by Lu et al. As is
typical with many contemporary journals, theirMethods section lacked
detail, and sowe consulted extensivelywith the original authors. One of
their key concernswas experiencewith the surgical procedure used and
the methods of transplantation; accordingly, we felt that it would be
most consistent with the overall goals of the replication project to enlist
the aid of the original surgeon to actually do the lesion surgeries and
transplantation. The rationale here is the same as for a highly skilled sur-
gical procedure for humans; it is reasonable to have the expert train
others in the procedures. Fortunately, the surgeon for the original
study (Dr. Paul Lu), was generous enough to do this.
Similarly, we felt that the primary goals of the replication project
would be best served to have the original authors prepare the NSC's
and growth factor cocktails. This is essentially the same as purchasing
a product (drug or biological) from a commercial entity. Fortunately,
the original experimental team was generous enough to do this.
Two different methods of transplantation
As discussed in the Methods section, NSC transplants were done in
two different ways. In terms of the fidelity of replication, it should be
noted that the Methods section in Lu et al. did not specify whether
scar tissue was removed at the time of transplantation or not. Our dis-
cussions with Dr. Lu revealed that 21 out of 26 of the rats in the original
study received transplants using Method 2 and 5 rats received trans-
plants using Method 1 (scar removal with implantation of a preformed
fibrin/thrombin gel).
a second injury leading to inflammatory cell invasion, which could
impede the growth of the graft. Alternatively, Method 1 also involves
203K.G. Sharp et al. / Experimental Neurology 257 (2014) 186–204the implantation of a preformed gel of fibrin/thrombin. This pre-
formed gel could create a physical impediment to the growth of the
graft. Indeed, the cavities may represent the space previously filled by
the gel. Further studies will be required to explore these and other
possible explanations.
Lu et al. report that NSCs transplanted without pretreatment with
growth factor cocktail did not survive well or grow to fill the lesion cav-
ity. They did not provide data on these control studies, however, and so
we did not carry out similar controls in our replication. Based on previ-
ous studies (reviewed in Bregman et al., 2002) it would not be surpris-
ing that treatment with growth factors was critical for the extensive
growth of the grafts in the harsh environment of a complete transection.
On the other hand, both E14/FSCs and lineage-restricted neural precur-
sors transplanted without growth factor treatment can expand to fill le-
sion cavities created by partial hemisections (Lepore and Fischer, 2005).
The presence of a transverse partition in the graft
Someof the grafts in the present study resembled those illustrated in
Lu et al. Most did not, however because they had a very distinct trans-
verse partition within the graft. At some of these partitions, there was
close apposition of neural tissue of the graft on the two sides (Category
2); at others, the partition was wider and contained non-neural tissue
(Category 3). It seems likely that partitions containing non-neuronal tis-
sue would block communication between rostral and caudal segments
in category 3 grafts. Clearly, it will be important to further test methods
of transplantation to achieve optimal engraftment.
Why transverse partitionsdevelop is unclear. Initially,we speculated
that the partitions developed at the site of the original transection. Fur-
ther consideration, however, indicated that the story is more complex.
At the time of the initial spinal cord injury surgery, two cuts were
made with scissors about 2 mm apart on one side of the spinal cord
and the tissue between the cuts was aspirated. Then the process was
repeated on the other side. Thus, there are actually 2 cuts on each side
and a large aspirated zone in between. This does not suggest a ready ex-
planation for the development of a single transverse partition. Another
puzzling feature is that the partitions are oriented in the transverse
plane and continuous in a more or less straight line from one side of
the spinal cord to the other. During the initial surgery, cuts were madeOur results indicate that the best engraftment (large grafts that fill
the lesion site) was in rats in which transplants were done without re-
moval of scar tissue (Method 2). In contrast, there were large cavities
in the grafts made with scar removal and implantation of a preformed
fibrin/thrombin gel. This is actually advantageous from the point of
view of therapeutic potential because removal of scar tissue would like-
ly pose a greater risk than transplantation without scar removal.
Grafts made with Method 2 completely filled the lesion site and
integrated extensively with host tissue. Extensive integration with
accompanying obliteration of the pial/glial scar has been previously
reported to occur with fetal grafts (Houle et al., 1999), as well as with
transplants of either blocks of fetal spinal cord called “E14 fetal stem
cells” (FSCs) or lineage-restricted neural precursors (Lepore and
Fischer, 2005). It should be noted that in the present study, a total of
1.5 × 106 cells were transplanted into large lesion cavities created by
complete transections, whereas in Lepore & Fischer, approximately
400,000 cells were transplanted into the smaller lesion cavity created
by lateral hemisection injury at C4. Although complete filling of the
lesion seems like a good thing, we are not aware of any published evi-
dence that complete filling of a lesion is required for effective anatomi-
cal/functional repair.
We can only speculate as to why large cavities form in grafts made
with Method 1. One possibility is that the removal of scar tissue createson one side, tissue was aspirated, and then cuts were made on theopposite side. It would be remarkable if the cuts on the two sides
lined up perfectly.
Previous studies have shown that there is substantial dieback of
transplanted cells during the first few days followed by expansion, pre-
sumably by proliferation (Lepore and Fischer, 2005; Theele et al., 1996).
It seems likely that therewould have beendieback of cells in the present
experiment, although this remains to be documented. One possible
explanation is that during expansion, the grafts somehow became
anchored to the host tissue of the rostral and caudal stumps early in
their growth and the two parts of the graft then expanded independent-
ly toward the center of the lesion forcing residual scar tissue to the point
at which the two growing ends abutted (thanks to Joseph Bonner for
suggesting this possibility). Further assessment of this and other possi-
bilities will require detailed studies of the development of the grafts
over time.
Recovery of motor function
There was no statistically significant difference in motor function
between grafted and control rats. The lack of motor recovery here vs.
in Lu et al. may be due to the fact that most of our grafts had partitions.
It should be noted, however, according to our understanding based on
communications with Dr. Lu, the functional data presented in Lu et al.
came from selected cases in which the grafts were judged to meet spe-
cific criteria (see Results).
Long-distance growth of axons from the graft
We observed the same extraordinary growth of graft-derived axons
that was described in Lu et al. Tens of thousands of GFP-positive axons
crossed the graft/host interface and extended for many mm along the
host spinal cord both rostral and caudal to the injury. Again, however,
growth factor treated NSCs are not unique in this regard. Lepore and
Fischer (2005) show images of alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labeled pro-
cess streaming from transplants of “E14FSCs”. Interestingly, AP-labeled
processes seem less prominent in Lepore & Fischer's images of grafts
of lineage-restricted precursors. Although the axonal nature of the
AP-labeled processes was not definitively established, the images are
similar to what is shown in Lu et al., 2012 and confirmed here. Indeed,
the most important advance from earlier studies of axon outgrowth
from grafts (Jakeman and Reier, 1991; Reier et al., 1986) is that axons
from grafts can now be identified by genetic labeling
5HT-positive neurons in the graft
We were surprised to discover 5HT-positive cells in the graft that
appeared to be neurons based on morphology. Also surprising was the
presence of 5HT positive axons extending caudally from the graft. We
cannot exclude the possibility that the 5HT positive axons caudal to
the graft were host axons that regenerated through and beyond the
graft, but it is muchmore likely that they are from the 5HT positive neu-
rons within the graft. Lu et al., saw no extension of 5HT positive axons
caudal to the graft and did not comment on the presence of 5HTpositive
neurons within the graft. The likely explanation is that the dissected
embryonic spinal cords in our study included part of the brainstem
and 5HT neuron precursors.
Limited growth of host axons into the graft
Tract tracing revealed that some reticulospinal axons were
intermingled with GFP-positive tissue from the graft. Intermingling of
host axons with graft-derived tissue could reflect either growth of
axons into the graft or migration of graft-derived cells into the host. In
any case, intermingling of host axons with graft was the exception,
and termination at the host/graft boundarywas the rule. Thus, although
our results confirmed the specific findings of Lu et al., our conclusion is
that growth of host axons into the graftwasmeager. Our results indicate
there would be few opportunities to form relay circuits that might
mediate recovery of function.
Graft-derived neurons grow robustly across the graft/host interface where-
as host axons do not
The fact that graft-derived axons grow past the graft/host boundary
readily and extend for many mm whereas host axons largely do not
extend into the graft suggests that axons from developing neurons in
the graft can overcome inhibitory factors in the terrain whereas host
axons cannot.
Conclusion
The present findings confirm robust engraftment of growth factor
treated NSCs when implanted into complete spinal cord transection
sites leading to complete filling of the cavity, extensive integration
with host tissue, and long-distance outgrowth of axons from the graft.
Our results did not confirm extensive ingrowth of host axons into the
graft or enhanced recovery of locomotor function in grafted rats, no
matter how the data were parsed. Our results also reveal differences
