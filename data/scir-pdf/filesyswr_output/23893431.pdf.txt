Recovery of locomotor behavior following spinal cord injury can occur spontaneously in some vertebrates, 
such as fish, urodele amphibians, and certain reptiles. This review provides an overview of the current status 
of our knowledge on the anatomical and electrophysiological changes occurring within the spinal cord that 
lead to, or are associated with the re-expression of locomotion in spinally-transected salamanders. A better 
understanding of these processes will help to devise strategies for restoring locomotor function in mammals, 
including humans.

Introduction
Many studies on the post-lesional plasticity of the central 
nervous system (CNS) of adult salamanders have dealt 
with the molecular and cellular events underlying spinal 
cord regeneration following tail amputation[1-6]. Regeneration 
in a context more relevant to human spinal cord injury (SCi) 
(i.e. after spinalization at the trunk level) has recently been 
investigated using labeling and imaging techniques[7], and 
the main finding is that meningeal and glial cells interact to 
form a permissive environment for axon regeneration after 
SCI in salamanders. This is in contrast to adult mammals, 
in which meningeal and glia cells form barriers (glial scars) 
that contribute to the prevention of axon regeneration[8-10]. 
Several non-permissive or inhibitory factors that prevent 
axonal regeneration in adult mammals have been 
found[11]. Differences between salamanders and mammals 
with regard to some of these factors, especially those 
controlling regeneration of the descending pathways known 
to activate the spinal locomotor networks, remain to be 
investigated. However, the molecular and cellular aspects 
of post-lesional plasticity of the spinal tracts are beyond 
the scope of the present review. Here, we summarize the 
anatomical and electrophysiological changes occurring 
within the spinal cord that lead to, or are associated with 
the re-expression of locomotion in salamanders after full 
transection of the spinal cord. A better understanding of 
these changes may provide insights regarding some of the 
conditions necessary for restoring locomotor function after 
SCi in higher vertebrates, including humans.
Model Organisms Used for the Study of Locomotor 
Recovery after SCI and Regeneration
Spinal neuronal circuits continuously process information 
received from the brain and peripheral sensory inputs. 
For instance, the central pattern generator circuitry for 
locomotion (locomotor CPG) can be activated and/or 
modulated by supraspinal or afferent inputs[12, 13]. This 
specialized network can be activated even in the isolated 
spinal cord, thus underlining the crucial role of the cord in 
gait generation. Following severe SCi, descending brain 
commands are disconnected from the locomotor CPG. 
Networks below the lesion can no longer be activated 
by the brain, and as a result, paralysis occurs in the 
region controlled by the spinal cord below the lesion. The 
subsequent degree of axonal regeneration and recovery 
of locomotor function below the lesion depends both on 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 467–476468
ontogeny and phylogeny. 
Anuran amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals 
can spontaneously regenerate the spinal cord only as 
larvae or embryos, and this capability decreases with the 
progression of development[10, 14]. By contrast, in some 
adult vertebrates such as lampreys[15], teleost fish[16], and 
urodele amphibians[17-20], severed axons from descending 
neurons can spontaneously re-grow across the lesion site, 
and progressively extend within the sub-lesional spinal 
cord. The extent of regenerated axons exceeds 10 
mm after a sufficiently long recovery time (>6 months 
post-transection)[19-22]. The number of re-growing axons 
projecting to the sub-lesional spinal cord also increases 
with time[20]. interestingly, neither new brainstem neurons 
(neurogenesis) nor axon collaterals from unlesioned 
neurons (sprouting) contribute to the restoration of 
descending projections after spinal cord transection in 
salamanders[21], fish and larval lampreys[23, 24].
Behavioral, kinematic and electrophysiological studies 
have provided evidence that the post-lesional locomotor 
recovery observed in species with a high regenerative ability 
is imperfect, even after a long period of recovery[17, 19, 25, 26]. 
For example, abnormal body undulations and sub-
lesional electromyographic (EMG) patterns occur during 
recovered swimming in spinally-transected lampreys and 
salamanders[19, 20, 25]. This is likely because the number 
of regenerated axons innervating the sub-lesional spinal 
cord is lower than that in intact animals, even after a 
recovery period as long as several months[27-29]. Moreover, 
inappropriate incorporation of the regenerated axons into 
the sub-lesional spinal networks could occur. This might 
be related to short- and long-term alterations of the cellular 
and network properties that occur in the spinal cord caudal 
to the injury site. indeed, this region should be considered 
as a “new spinal cord”, with neurons endowed with new 
electrical membrane properties, new expression patterns of 
neurotransmitter receptors, and new connectivity[30].
in the freshwater turtle the completely transected 
spinal cord is reconnected, and it has been suggested 
that this constitutes a suitable vertebrate model system for 
studying the plasticity of the locomotor CPG after complete 
SCi[31]. However, locomotor recovery in this species is 
incomplete and restricted to stepping. Moreover, further 
investigation is required to demonstrate a direct causal 
relationship between axonal regeneration and the recovery 
of stepping. indeed, one should stress that visual inspection 
and/or kinematic analysis of locomotor behavior cannot be 
used to accurately infer the participation of regenerated 
axons in the locomotor recovery after SCi (see below).
Following a lesion, not only the descending pathways, 
but also the ascending axons from spinal neurons that 
convey signals from the locomotor CPG (internal 
feedback)[32-34] and/or sensory information from the body 
region caudal to the transection site are axotomized. in 
several lower vertebrates, only a fraction of the ascending 
axons regenerate after spinalization (salamander[35], 
goldfish[36], larval anuran[37], lamprey[27]). Therefore, it is 
likely that a significant reorganization of the neuronal 
networks also occurs above the lesion site because of the 
loss of some of these ascending fibers[38]. 
in the present review, we focus on the neuronal 
mechanisms underlying the post-injury plasticity of the 
spinal locomotor CPG in adult salamanders.
The salamander is an excellent experimental model 
system to address this issue since: (1) it is the only 
tetrapod that can recover locomotor function in adulthood 
after full transection at all rostro-caudal levels of the spinal 
cord[20]; (2) it displays terrestrial and aquatic locomotor 
modes, and this gives the opportunity to compare the post-
lesional recovery of the two modes; (3) a significant amount 
of data on locomotion in intact animals is available to 
evaluate the quality of the recovered locomotion[39]; (4) its 
CNS can survive several hours in vitro, and this allows the 
use of electrophysiological methods to investigate at the 
cellular level the alterations of the locomotor circuits after 
SCi[40-42]; and (5) the global architecture of the locomotor 
CPG for swimming and stepping has been deciphered and 
modeled[43, 44].
Recovery of Locomotor Patterns in Spinally-
transected Salamanders
Earlier behavioral[17, 18] and kinematic studies[20] have 
revealed that in adult salamanders the ability to walk and 
swim can recover ~3 months after a complete spinal cord 
transection. Re-transection of the cord after recovery 
from the first transection results in paralysis, once again, 
of the body part controlled by the cord below the lesion. 
This suggests that the recovery of locomotion results from 
the re-establishment of descending inputs across the 
Jean-Marie Cabelguen, et al.    Locomotor recovery in spinal salamander 469
transection[18, 20].
However, since muscle activation was not recorded 
in these studies, the relative contributions of muscle 
contractions and passive factors to locomotor recovery 
were unknown. in a previous study, we made EMG 
recordings during swimming and terrestrial stepping in the 
same adult salamander before and at various times (up to 
500 days) after a complete transection of the spinal cord at 
the trunk level (between the two girdles)[19]. We used this 
approach to assess the time-course and completeness of 
locomotor recovery as reflected in the various locomotor 
parameters (cycle duration, intersegmental coordination, 
inter-limb coupling) that had been previously documented 
in intact animals[45, 46].
our results evidenced that 2–3 weeks after spinalization, 
locomotor movements and EMG activity were limited 
to the forelimbs and the body rostral to the transection. 
Thereafter, the locomotor movements and EMG activity 
returned at progressively more caudal levels, and the 
animals reached stable locomotor patterns 3–4 months 
post-transection. Several locomotor parameters (cycle 
duration, intersegmental phase lag, inter-limb coupling) 
measured at various recovery times after spinalization 
were compared to those in intact animals. These 
comparisons revealed transient and long-term alterations 
in the locomotor parameters both above and below the 
transection site. These alterations were much more 
pronounced for swimming than for stepping, revealing 
differences in adaptive plasticity between the two locomotor 
modes. 
Recovered locomotor EMG activity was immediately 
abolished by a re-transection at the site of original 
spinalization (Fig. 1). This reveals that the re-innervation 
of the spinal cord below the transection site by descending 
brain and/or propriospinal axons primarily accounts for the 
locomotor recovery in spinally-transected salamanders, 
and the regenerated axons made sufficient appropriate 
synaptic contacts with neurons of the locomotor network 
caudal to the transection. interestingly, behavioral, 
electrophysiological, and morphological experiments 
conducted in larval lampreys and fish have shown that the 
descending re-growing axons form functional synapses 
associated with swimming recovery[22, 47-49].
However, during the very early stages of recovery, 
mechano-sensory coupling across the transection could 
also be involved in the re-activation of the locomotor 
CPG[50, 51]. At more advanced stages, when the caudal 
portion of the body begins to recover some movements, 
the proprioceptive signals from the hindlimbs might 
enhance the excitability of the CPG[52]. The role of afferent 
signals in the re-activation of the CPG might be addressed 
in a comparative study of the fictive locomotor patterns 
expressed in vitro by spinal cords isolated from intact and 
chronic spinal salamanders (see[53] in the cat). 
Interestingly, in fish[54] and cats[55] locomotor recovery 
following a complete cord transection can be significantly 
facilitated by daily training sessions. This emphasizes 
the crucial role of proprioceptive afferent inputs in the re-
activation of the locomotor CPG. Salamanders would be 
a suitable model system to identify the neuronal events 
induced by training during swimming and stepping. 
interestingly, in fish, swim training improves axonal 
regeneration across the SCi[54].
Regeneration of Descending Pathways in 
Spinally-transected Salamanders
in salamanders, many descending neurons, including 
reticulospinal neurons that transmit the locomotor drive from 
the mesencephalic and diencephalic locomotor regions to the 
spinal locomotor CPG, regenerate axons[19-21, 28]. Chevallier 
et al.[19] further demonstrated that some of the regenerated 
axons come from glutamatergic and serotoninergic 
(5-HT) immunoreactive cells within the reticular formation. 
We have also provided evidence that regeneration of 
cholinergic descending propriospinal neurons occurs after 
complete spinal transection in salamanders (Fig. 2 and 
see[19, 21]).
Glutamatergic Neurons
Glutamatergic reticulospinal neurons are critical for initiating 
locomotion (command neurons) in all vertebrates[56]. From 
this, it is clear that the primary focus in different animal 
models that seek to establish the functional regeneration of 
descending locomotor drives from the brainstem across an 
SCi should be on the reticulospinal pathways[57].
The spontaneous regeneration of reticulospinal 
glutamatergic axons in salamanders could contribute to the 
activation of the locomotor networks below the lesion. it is 
possible that only non-specific connectivity to the neuronal 
circuitry caudal to the lesion is sufficient to turn this part of 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 467–476470
the locomotor CPG on and off. one reason is that in the 
isolated spinal cord of salamanders (as well mammals), 
the locomotor CPG can be turned on by bath-application 
of glutamate agonists, a non-specific mode of activation[40]. 
The use of patch clamp and calcium imaging techniques 
most likely will help to address this issue.
Serotoninergic Neurons
Salamanders have a well-developed intraspinal 5-HT 
system, as well as a supraspinal raphé 5-HT system[58]. 
Although 5-HT by itself fails to initiate locomotion, it shapes 
both the swimming and stepping patterns expressed by 
the salamander spinal cord in vitro[58, 59]. In particular, 5-HT 
agonists increase both the duration and intensity of the 
locomotor bursts in intact animals. Therefore, the axons 
of reticulospinal 5-HT neurons that regenerate across the 
lesion could contribute to the restoration of the sub-lesional 
EMG activity in transected animals by modulating the non-
linear membrane properties of 5-HT-dependent neurons[60]. 
in contrast, there is no experimental evidence that some 
of the intraspinal 5-HT neurons regenerate axons after 
transection. interestingly, there is compelling evidence 
that these neurons are involved in the spinal control of 
locomotion in mammals[60]. 
Associated with SCI is a marked alteration in the 5-HT 
control of the swimming rhythm in salamanders. indeed, 
application of 5-HT to 1–2 lumbo-sacral segments of the 
sub-lesional cord induces a dose-dependent increase in the 
swimming rhythm in recovered spinal salamanders, while 
a similar application to intact animals induces a decrease 
in the swimming rhythm (Figs. 3 and 4). But a similar 
local application of 5-HT in intact or spinal-transected 
salamanders fails to significantly alter the stepping rhythm

(not illustrated). These results are also consistent with the 
differential degree of post-lesional plasticity of swimming 
and stepping networks in salamanders (see above). Finally, 
5-HT can play a critical trophic role in regeneration in 
addition to its function in neuromodulation[61, 62], but this 
remains to be investigated in the present context.
Cholinergic Neurons
The role of regenerated cholinergic propriospinal neurons 
in the re-establishment of locomotor function in spinally-
transected salamanders remains an open question. one 
possibility is that they contribute to recovery by relaying the 
descending locomotor drive in the most caudal levels of the 
cord. Therefore, cholinergic propriospinal neurons would 
be an important target for strategies designed to produce 
locomotor recovery[63, 64]. 
Recovery of Motoneuron Excitability in Spinally-
transected Salamanders
Motoneurons (MNs) are the output stage of the locomotor 
networks and consequently transduce neuronal activity to 
movement. As MNs can be identified by simple retrograde 
tracer injection into muscles or ventral roots, these cells are 
easier to study (anatomically and electrophysiologically) 
than the interneurons of the locomotor networks. The 
intrinsic firing properties of MNs depend on the ionic 
conductances that they express. These conductances are 
under neuromodulatory control that can reshape the MN

firing pattern, and hence the output of the locomotor CPG[65, 66], 
for tuning and adapting the locomotor drive to changing 
conditions[67]. Since the neuromodulatory descending 
systems can be disrupted after SCi, strategies aiming at 
restoring locomotor movements need to address not only 
the premotor circuits that provide the locomotor drive but 
also the modulatory system that ensures that MNs are 
sufficiently excitable to respond to that drive.
Among the neuromodulators, acetylcholine (ACh) 
provides ongoing modulation of locomotor activity in 
many vertebrates[64, 68], including salamanders[69]. Since 
cholinergic propriospinal cells can be used as a relay of the 
locomotor drive, we have performed a comparative analysis 
of the cholinergic modulation of the excitability of MNs in 
intact and spinally-transected salamanders[70, 71]. We found 
that ACh increases the gain (input-output relationship) of 
hindlimb MNs via activation of muscarinic receptors in intact 
and transected salamanders. our data further revealed 
that the gain of MNs is larger in early spinal (<2 weeks 
post-lesion) than in late spinal (3–4 weeks post-lesion) 
animals, while the value of the gain in late spinal animals 
is close to that in intact animals (Fig. 5). The muscarinic-

induced increase in the excitability of hindlimb MNs 
primarily results, both in intact and spinal animals, from a 
reduction in the medium-duration afterhyperpolarization 
(mAHP) amplitude[70, 71]. This result is consistent with 
previous studies in cat and mouse[72, 73] that demonstrated 
that the mAHP of spinal MNs is a target for modulation 
during locomotor behavior. our results also provided 
evidence that the proportion of hindlimb MNs that express 
plateau potentials and after-discharges (bistability[66]) 
during muscarinic activation is strongly increased following 
spinalization. The increased MN excitability in transected 
animals could explain the hindlimb and tail hyper-reflexia 
observed after spinalization and before locomotor recovery.
it could be argued that the regeneration of descending 
cholinergic propriospinal neurons across the transection 
(see above) explains the MN gain reverting to normal 
four weeks after spinalization. However, previous 
anatomical and electrophysiological studies did not find re-

level). The slope of the f–I relationship (gain) was steeper for the MN of the animal spinalized less than 2 weeks before recording, 
indicating a transient higher responsiveness to the same injected current. B: Mean values of the slope of the f–I plot for 17 MNs

innervation of the cord below the lesion 3–4 weeks post-
transection[19, 20, 58]. Further investigations are therefore 
needed to identify the underlying mechanisms. 
in addition, since several neuromodulators affect the 
excitability of spinal MNs during locomotion (see recent 
review[74]), it is important to determine how they contribute, 
individually and in conjunction, to locomotor recovery after 
SCi.
Conclusion
The adult salamander is an excellent experimental model 
to study the post-lesional plasticity of motor systems in 
vertebrates. indeed, the neurobiological study of locomotor 
recovery in spinally-transected salamanders provides 
valuable information on the mechanisms required to 
regain locomotor function after SCi. Furthermore, the 
spectacular capacity of salamanders to regenerate neurons 
also applies to midbrain dopaminergic neurons following 
a chemical lesion, and this has been used to create a 
new parkinsonian animal model in which the recovery of 
motor behavior is associated with dopaminergic neuron 
regeneration/neurogenesis[75]. in the context of SCi, much 
more work is needed to understand the reorganization of 
the salamander’s locomotor networks in the spinal state. 
Rewiring of the networks, modifications in the balance 
between various transmitter systems, alterations in the 
intrinsic properties of axotomized descending neurons, and 
the contribution of sensory information are some important 
avenues to explore. it is hoped that the knowledge gained 
from these future studies will serve to target therapeutic 
approaches for rehabilitation in people with spinal injuries.
