Abstract
In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish have the ability to regrow descending axons and gain locomotor recovery after spinal cord
injury (SCI). In zebrafish, a decisive factor for successful spinal cord regeneration is the inherent ability of some neurons to regrow
their axons via (re)expressing growth-associated genes during the regeneration period. The nucleus of the medial longitudinal
fascicle (NMLF) is one of the nuclei capable of regenerative response after SCI. Using microarray analysis with laser capture
microdissected NMLF, we show that cysteine- and glycine-rich protein (CRP)1a (encoded by the csrp1a gene in zebrafish), the
function of which is largely unknown in the nervous system, was upregulated after SCI. In situ hybridization confirmed the
upregulation of csrp1a expression in neurons during the axon growth phase after SCI, not only in the NMLF, but also in other nuclei
capable of regeneration, such as the intermediate reticular formation and superior reticular formation. The upregulation of csrp1a
expression in regenerating nuclei started at 3 days after SCI and continued to 21 days post-injury, the longest time point studied.
In vivo knockdown of CRP1a expression using two different antisense morpholino oligonucleotides impaired axon regeneration and
locomotor recovery when compared with a control morpholino, demonstrating that CRP1a upregulation is an important part of the
innate regeneration capability in injured neurons of adult zebrafish. This study is the first to demonstrate the requirement of CRP1a
for zebrafish spinal cord regeneration.
Introduction
In adult mammals, the failure of injured axons to regenerate after
spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in permanent disabilities.
Inhibitory molecules in the spinal cord are known to be major
contributors to regeneration failure (David & Aguayo, 1981; Schwab
& Bartholdi, 1996; Silver & Miller, 2004). However, removing
inhibitory activities only induces limited axon regeneration that is
insufficient for successful functional recovery (Zheng et al., 2003;
Case & Tessier-Lavigne, 2005; Yiu & He, 2006; Cafferty et al.,
2008), pointing to the importance of understanding the mechanisms
for the intrinsic regenerative competence of neurons. Unlike mam-
mals, adult zebrafish have the innate ability to regenerate descending
axons after SCI, leading to locomotor recovery. In zebrafish, a crucial
contributor to successful axon regeneration is the inherent ability of
neurons to (re)express growth-associated genes and regrow their axons
(Becker et al., 1997, 2004; Bernhardt, 1999; Becker & Becker, 2008).
In vivo depletion of these growth-associated genes dramatically
impairs axon regeneration and locomotor recovery (Becker et al.,
2004; Yu et al., 2011a,b). The ability to upregulate growth-associated
genes during the regeneration period makes the adult zebrafish a
valuable model for identifying molecules involved in successful spinal
cord regeneration.
The nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle (NMLF), an
anatomically well-defined nucleus, is one of several nuclei exhibiting
a robust regenerative response after SCI as demonstrated by the
upregulation of growth-associated genes and axonal regrowth (Becker
et al., 1997, 1998, 2004; Yu et al., 2011a,b). To investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying this successful regeneration
response, we performed microarray analysis with laser capture
microdissected NMLF. The list of upregulated genes in the growth
phase included known growth-associated genes, such as growth-
associated protein 43 (GAP-43), as well as novel genes, the roles of
which in axon regeneration are uncharacterized, such as cysteine- and
glycine-rich protein (CRP)1.
Cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1 is a member of the Lin11, Isl-1
and Mec-3-domain protein CRP family including CRP1 (CRP1a is
encoded by the csrp1a gene in zebrafish), CRP2, and CRP3 ⁄muscle
Lin11, Isl-1 and Mec-3-domain protein (Louis et al., 1997). All CRP
family members are highly expressed in muscle (Jain et al., 1998) and
CRP1 is regarded as a marker for smooth muscle cells (Henderson

et al., 1999). CRP1 is involved in many different cellular functions,
acting as a transcriptional cofactor (Chang et al., 2003), suppressing
cell proliferation, protecting cells from stress-induced death (Latonen
et al., 2008), regulating cell movement during zebrafish development
(Miyasaka et al., 2007), and promoting neointima formation (Lilly
et al., 2010). CRP1 localizes to the nucleus and actin cytoskeleton
(Tran et al., 2005; Jang & Greenwood, 2009), and interacts with a-
actinin (Pomies et al., 1997) and zyxin (Sadler et al., 1992; Schmei-
chel & Beckerle, 1998). CRP1 is the only CRP family member that
has detectable expression in the mammalian central nervous system
(Jain et al., 1998). However, little is known about the functions of
CRP1 in the central nervous system. In the present study, we report
that csrp1a is upregulated after SCI and its expression in vivo is
essential for successful axonal regeneration and locomotor recovery.
Our results identify CRP1a as a key component of functional spinal
cord regeneration in adult zebrafish.
Materials and methods
Spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish
Male adult zebrafish (Danio rerio, age > 6 months) were purchased
from Aquatica Tropicals Inc. (Plant City, FL, USA). The fish were
kept on a 14-h light and 10-h dark cycle at 28 C.
The SCI was performed as described previously (Becker et al.,
1997, 2004; Guo et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011a,b). Briefly, fish were
immersed in 0.033% aminobenzoic acid ethylmethylester (MS222;
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 5 min. After a longitudinal incision
was made to expose the vertebral column, a complete transection of
the spinal cord was performed between two vertebrae, about 1 mm
(for microarray analysis and in situ hybridization) or 3.5 mm [for
morpholino (MO) application] caudal to the brainstem–spinal cord
junction, corresponding to the second and eighth vertebra, respec-
tively. The number of animals used for each experiment can be found
in the figure legends. The sham-lesioned control (CON) had identical
surgical procedures except that the spinal cord was not cut. The wound
was sealed with Histoacryl (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany).
All animal experiments were carried out according to a protocol
approved by the Rutgers University Institutional Animal Use and Care
Committee, which conformed to NIH guidelines. Fish were killed with
overdose anesthesia.
Laser capture microdissection, RNA isolation and amplification
A photoablation and laser microdissection system (Carl Zeiss,
Thornwood, NY, USA) was used as previously described (Liss et al.,
2005). At 4 h, 12 h or 11 days after SCI, the brain was removed,
embedded in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound, and
snap frozen in isopentane (cooled on dry ice). Utilizing the atlas of
zebrafish brain (Wullimann et al., 1996), coronal cryosections
(20 lm) of zebrafish brainstem containing NMLF (approximately 30
sections) were cut and mounted on RNase-free, ultraviolet-light-
treated, and poly-L-lysine-coated membrane slides (1 mm polyethyl-
ene ⁄ naphthalate membrane, photoablation and laser microdissection).
Sections were fixed with ethanol (three washes with 70, 95 and 100%
ethanol, respectively) and stained with 1% cresyl violet in 100%
ethanol, and dried. The NMLF area was cut and captured directly into
an adhesive cap (photoablation and laser microdissection). The buffer
RLT (RNeasy Micro kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) supplemented
with b-mercaptoethanol (10 lL ⁄mL) was added into the tube, which
was then incubated upside-down for 30 min at 25 C. Each condition
(control or SCI) consisted of three microarrays. The RNA sample for
each microarray was prepared from NMLF tissues pooled from three
animals.
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s directions with the addition of linear
acrylamide (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) as RNA carrier to the lysate.
The RNA was amplified using the RampUP RNA amplification kit
(Genisphere, Hatfield, PA, USA) following the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction
Affymetrix GeneChip Zebrafish Genome Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) containing 15 617 probes for 14 900 transcripts
were used for gene expression analysis, according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Complementary DNA was reverse transcribed
from the amplified RNA and hybridized to microarrays. Following
hybridization, the arrays were washed and scanned following standard
Affymetrix protocols. Data were extracted from CEL files using the
robust multi-array average method (Irizarry et al., 2003) as imple-
mented in GeneSpring GX (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The
exploratory list (Table 1 and Supporting Information Table S1) was
generated in GeneSpring by selecting genes with a t-test P-value of
0.05 or less and a fold change from control of 1.5 or more, both at
11 days after injury. The table (Table 1 and Supporting Information
Table S1) lists average fold-change expression at each time point
(calculated by taking the antilog of the log normalization values for
each replicate array in GeneSpring) and the SEM. Data files have been
deposited in the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus repository with the
study accession number GSE28470. The link for the Gene Expression
Omnibus dataset is https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/
acc.cgi?acc=GSE28470.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was
performed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as previously described (Goff
et al., 2004). The comparative cycle threshold Ct method (DDCt
method) was used for data analysis. Results were expressed relative to
control, sham-injured fish. The same cDNA used for the microarrays
was used to test the expression of GAP-43 and csrp1a in the NMLF
after SCI. To study the expression of csrp1a in spinal cord caudal to
the lesion site, total RNA was prepared from 4 mm pieces of whole
spinal cord directly caudal to the lesion site. The primers used are as
follows: zebrafish csrp1a (forward: 5¢-TGCTTCCTGTGCATGGTT
TG-3¢; reverse: 5¢-GGCCACCGTGGTACTGTCA-3¢), zebrafish
GAP-43 (forward: 5¢-TCAGGAGATCAAGCAGGATGG-3¢; reverse:
5¢-GCCTTGTGAGCGTTTTCCTC-3¢) and zebrafish ribosomal pro-
tein P0 (forward: 5¢-TCGGCTACCCAACTCTTGCT-3¢; reverse:
5¢-TGTTTCGACAGTGACAGCCAG-3¢).
In situ hybridization
Digoxigenin-labeled RNA sense and antisense probes for zebrafish
csrp1a (NM_205567, 125–554 bp of coding sequence) were gener-
ated using the Megascript
TM
system (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and in situ hybridization was performed with
some modifications as previously described (Becker et al., 1998;
Lieberoth et al., 2003). No significant similarity was found with other
zebrafish genes, demonstrating its specificity for csrp1a. Briefly,
20-lm-thick coronal sections containing the NMLF, intermediate
reticular formation (IMRF) and superior reticular formation (SRF)
were incubated with 0.1 N HCl for 10 min, followed by three washes
354 L. Ma et al.

in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and then digested for
10 min with 10 lg ⁄mL proteinase-K (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
at room temperature, followed by two washes with glycine
(2 mg ⁄mL) in PBS, pH 7.4. Next, the sections were acetylated,
dehydrated, air-dried, pre-hybridized, and subsequently hybridized
with digoxigenin-labeled probe at 55 C overnight. The hybridized
probes were detected using alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxi-
genin antibody (Roche) and color developed with nitro-blue tetrazo-
lium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche). The same
development time was used for sections from control and SCI animals.
In situ hybridization with the sense control probe was performed in
parallel with the antisense probe on sections from injured animals, and
no significant signal for the sense probe was observed. Neurons in the
NMLF can be easily identified by their anatomical location according
to the atlas of zebrafish brain (Wullimann et al., 1996) and their large
size (13–23 lm diameter) (Becker et al., 1997), and are thus
distinguishable from the small size of glial cells (Becker et al.,
1998). For profile counting, positively stained neurons in the NMLF,
IMRF, or SRF from each animal were counted with the experimenter
blinded to the treatment of each fish.
Double staining for in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry
The labeling of cells coexpressing csrp1a (in situ hybridization) and
the neuronal marker neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (immunohistochemistry)
was performed after signal development by in situ hybridization.
Slides were rinsed in PBS three times (5 min per wash) and antigen
retrieval for immunohistochemistry was performed by incubation of
the slides with 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95 C for 15 min as
described previously (Ma et al., 2006). The slides were then allowed
to cool to room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the slides
were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% goat serum in
PBS, and incubated with mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1 : 150, A-60,
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 4 C overnight. The slides were
then washed three times in PBS and incubated with secondary
antibody Alexa Fluor 555 (1 : 600, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Application of morpholinos and biocytin
Two different antisense MO oligonucleotides for zebrafish csrp1a
(NM_205567) (csrp1a MO1: 5¢-GTTTCCACCCCCAAGAGGCATC
CTG-3¢; csrp1a MO2: 5¢-CTGCTAGGTGTGTGGATATGAAGAG-3¢)
were designed and synthesized by Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR,
USA). Both csrp1aMOs are directed to the start codon region to block
translation. No significant similarity was found with other zebrafish
genes, demonstrating their specificity for csrp1a. Csrp1a MO1 was
tagged with carboxyfluorescein at the 3¢ end. The specificity of csrp1a
MO2 has been previously demonstrated and its effects on zebrafish
embryos can be rescued by coinjection of csrp1a mRNA (Miyasaka
et al., 2007). Csrp1a MO2 could not be coupled with carboxyfluo-
rescein due to its high G content, but was included to compare with
previous studies. The sequence for the standard control MO, which
was also tagged with carboxyfluorescein at the 3¢ end, was 5¢-
CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3¢. The MOs were dissolved
in Danieau solution [58 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4,
0.6 mm Ca(NO3)2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6] and applied as previously
described (Becker et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011a,b).
Fish were treated with 600 ng MO (approximately 0.27 lL,
absorbed into Gelfoam, Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) at the lesion
site immediately after transection. The MO is taken up by lesionedT

axons and retrogradely transported to the cells of origin in the brain,
where protein synthesis for the target gene is blocked. The MO-treated
fish were allowed to survive for 6 weeks. The dosing of the MOs
(600 ng ⁄ fish) was chosen based our previous publication showing that
400 ng L1.1 MO is effective for knocking down protein expression
and locomotor recovery in the identical zebrafish injury model (Becker
et al., 2004). Also, the effectiveness of this dosing has been confirmed
by several publications from our group (Guo et al., 2011; Yu et al.,
2011a,b).
At 6 weeks after the MO application, the neuronal tracer biocytin
(Sigma)-saturated solution (approximately 0.27 lL, absorbed in
Gelfoam) was applied to a secondary lesion site, which was 7 mm
caudal to the brainstem–spinal cord junction, i.e. 3.5 mm caudal to the
first spinal lesion site for MO application. Twenty-four hours later, the
brains were dissected, embedded in optimal cutting temperature
compound, and transversely frozen-sectioned. The biocytin was
detected with the Vectastain ABC-DAB kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) as previously described (Becker et al., 1997;
Yu et al., 2011a). For profile counting, all positively stained neurons
in the NMLF, IMRF, and SRF of each animal were counted with the
experimenter blinded to the treatment of each fish.
Locomotor analysis
At 6 weeks after SCI and MO application (before the application of
biocytin), the total distance moved by the MO-treated fish was
measured to examine locomotor recovery. Tracking of freely moving
fish was performed as previously described (Becker et al., 2004; Guo
et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011a,b). Each fish was placed in a glass tank
(50 · 30 cm) and allowed to move freely for 5 min while a video
recording was captured using a camera mounted above the tank. Swim
paths were tracked and calculated with the ANY-maze video tracking
system (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA).
Western blot analysis
At 11 days after SCI and MO application as described above, a 2 mm
section of spinal cord tissue, centered on the transection site, was
dissected and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Sigma)
supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche). After homogenization,
the lysate was pelleted and the protein concentration was determined
with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). Proteins were resolved on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel
(Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
The blot was probed by a polyclonal CRP1 antibody produced in
rabbit against the C-terminal of rat CRP1 (PKGFGFGQGA-
GALVHSE) at 1.12 lg ⁄mL. The antibody was a kind gift from Dr
Greenwood (Oregon University, USA). a-Tubulin (1 : 1000, T9026,
Sigma) served as a loading control on the same membrane after
stripping. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invi-
trogen, 1 : 5000) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-
mouse (Millipore, 1 : 5000) were used as secondary antibodies. The
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA) was used for signal detection. Quantitative analysis was
performed using Kodak molecular imaging software version 4.0
(Carestream Molecular Imaging, New Haven, CT, USA).
Statistical analysis
Images were captured using a digital charge-coupled device camera
attached to a microscope driven by AxioVision software (Zeiss). A
two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for results of microarray and
qPCR of GAP-43 and csrp1a in both NMLF and spinal cord, results of
csrp1a-positive neuronal profiles in different regenerative nuclei at
11 days after SCI, and results of fluorescein-positive cell profiles of
control MO and csrp1a MO1 at 6 weeks after MO application. One-
way anova followed by a Tukey’s post hoc test when appropriate was
used for results of densitometric analysis of CRP1a expression after
MO application, results of locomotor recovery of fish after MO
application, and results of neuronal profiles retrogradely labeled after
MO application in different regenerative nuclei. Two-way anova
followed by a Tukey’s post hoc test when appropriate was used for
results of csrp1a-positive neuronal profiles in different regenerative
nuclei at different time points. The level of significance was set at
P < 0.05 for all analyses. Data are shown as mean values ± SEM.
Statistical analyses were performed using r 2.12.2 (a free statistical
software from http://www.r-project.org).
Results
Gene expression profiling of regenerating neurons in the
nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle
In adult zebrafish, there are 20 distinct brain nuclei projecting to the
spinal cord. Neurons in most brain nuclei grow axons beyond the
transection site at 3.5 mm caudal to the brainstem–spinal cord
transition zone (Becker et al., 1997). It has been reported that
different nuclei with the capacity to regenerate their axons have similar
expression patterns for growth-associated genes, suggesting a shared
molecular mechanism (Becker et al., 1998). The NMLF neurons
mount a robust regeneration response after SCI (Becker et al., 1997,
1998, 2004; Yu et al., 2011a,b). In addition, the NMLF is anatom-
ically well defined, making it an excellent candidate to perform a
screening assay such as microarray analysis. Spinal cord transection
was performed at 1 mm caudal to the brainstem–spinal cord junction
(Fig. 1). As the distance between the spinal cord and brainstem–spinal
cord junction increases, the number of neurons in the brain projecting
to the spinal cord decreases (Becker et al., 1997). Thus, transection at
the relatively rostral 1 mm level affects most neurons of the NMLF.
Brain samples were collected at different time points to distinguish
early (4 and 12 h) regulation in response to axotomy from regulation
associated with the growth phase of descending axons (11 days). This
time is when neurons increase the expression of growth-associated
genes and exhibit active axon growth after SCI (Becker et al., 1998,
2004). To concentrate the effect of injury response in relatively few
cells within the region, laser capture microdissection was used to
harvest NMLF from brain sections of sham-lesioned control or spinal
cord-lesioned animals (Fig. 1). Because of the limited number of
neurons in the NMLF and the small quantity of RNA recovered from
captured NMLF, RNA amplification was performed and the resulting
cDNA was used for microarray analysis (Fig. 1). Each condition
(control or SCI) consisted of three microarrays, with the total RNA
sample for each microarray prepared from laser-dissected NMLF
tissues pooled from three animals.
The Zebrafish GeneChip microarray from Affymetrix was used for
microarray analysis. As changes in gene expression at 11 days after
SCI associate with the growth phase of descending axons, we initially
tested for mRNA regulation due to axotomy injury at 11 days. When
using a two-way anova, no genes were found to be significantly
affected by injury, probably due to the small fold changes and the
limited number of arrays. However, to extract an exploratory list of
potentially regulated genes, we selected 143 genes based solely on
Student’s t-test at P £ 0.05 and a minimum 1.5-fold change

(Supporting Information Table S1). The gene symbols and descrip-
tions were obtained with DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/)
(Huang da et al., 2009a,b). The fold changes for gene expression in
our microarray data were not as high as in, for instance, another study
that used zebrafish retinal ganglion cells for microarray analysis
(Veldman et al., 2007), the reason for this probably being the small
number of NMLF neurons (about 60) in each brain, and the presence
of non-neuronal cells in the laser-dissected NMLF nucleus and ⁄ or
other neurons that are not capable of regenerating after SCI, like cells
in the nucleus ruber (Becker et al., 1997). Table 1 lists a subset of
upregulated genes from the exploratory list, selected based on
published results linking their function to SCI or based on association
with mechanisms thought to be prominent in SCI. As shown in
Table 1, few of the genes upregulated at 11 days post-injury had
changes in expression level in the early phase after axotomy,
consistent with a specific role for those genes during the axon
regeneration phase. This list contains several genes the roles of which
have been reported in axon regeneration (outgrowth), including matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (Vaillant et al., 2003), GAP-43 (Skene, 1989; Leu
et al., 2010), activating transcription factor 3 (Seijffers et al., 2006)
and decorin (Davies et al., 2004; Minor et al., 2008). We used
antisense MOs to study the functional roles of several of these genes
proposed to be important for spinal cord regeneration, including
csrp1a. As only csrp1a MO reduced the recovery of locomotor
function, we chose to focus on this molecule.
Expression of csrp1a mRNA is upregulated in the nucleus of the
medial longitudinal fascicle after spinal cord injury
If CRP1a is a growth-associated protein it should be regulated in
parallel with other genes known to participate in regenerative
mechanisms. GAP-43 is a well-known marker of axonal growth
(Skene, 1989) and its expression is upregulated in different
regenerating models (Bormann et al., 1998; Costigan et al., 2002;
Veldman et al., 2007). Expression of GAP-43 mRNA is also
upregulated in neurons of the NMLF and other nuclei capable of
regeneration after SCI in adult zebrafish (Becker et al., 1998). Here,
GAP-43 is used as a positive control for genes that are upregulated
after SCI. The microarray data showed that the normalized fold
induction for GAP-43 mRNA at 11 days after SCI was 2.3
(2.304 ± 0.156, n = 3 experiments, two-tailed t-test, P = 0.003)
compared with the sham-lesioned control (CON), whereas the fold
induction for csrp1a mRNA was 1.71 (1.714 ± 0.158, n = 3
experiments, two-tailed t-test, P = 0.03) (Fig. 2A). The upregulation
of GAP-43 and csrp1a expression in the microarray data was
verified by qPCR, which showed that the fold induction values for
GAP-43 and csrp1a expression were 3.45 (3.45 ± 0.7, n = 3
experiments, two-tailed t-test, P = 0.03) and 1.44 (1.44 ± 0.1,
n = 3 experiments, two-tailed t-test, P = 0.01), respectively
(Fig. 2B). The discrepancy in the fold inductions between micro-
array and qPCR could be due to the difference in the amplification
methods and detection techniques used in those assays; however, the
reproduction of the upregulation by qPCR agrees with the predicted
change observed on microarrays. Csrp1a expression is increased in
NMLF after spinal axotomy, at a time when regenerative growth is
observed.
In addition to neurons regenerating axons after SCI in the brain, the
spinal cord region caudal to the lesion site, into which the regenerating
axons must regrow, also contributes to the regenerative capacity
(Becker et al., 1998, 2004; Guo et al., 2011). For example, expression
of adhesion molecule L1.1 is upregulated in the caudal spinal cord
after SCI and probably promotes spinal cord regeneration by acting
not only in regrowing axons, but also in the caudal part of the injured
spinal cord affecting, for instance, neuronal survival, axonal growth of
interneurons and ⁄ or synaptic plasticity (Becker et al., 2004). The
expression of csrp1a mRNA in the spinal cord region caudal to the
lesion site was therefore examined using qPCR to determine if it also
functions in the regenerative milieu. Unlike the response found in the
NMLF, the expression of csrp1a caudal to the lesion site was slightly
decreased at 11 days after SCI (0.79 ± 0.02, n = 3 experiments, two-

were collected. After staining with cresyl violet, laser capture microdissection

NMLF tissue and was amplified. cDNA from amplified RNA was used for
microarray analysis. Scale bar, 1 mm.

tailed t-test, P = 0.001) (Fig. 2C). The downregulation of csrp1a
expression after injury in the caudal part of the spinal cord could be
related to the possibility that reduced levels in the regeneration-
conducive tissue are associated with regrowth of axons. As csrp1a
expression is upregulated in the NMLF, we conclude that this
upregulation is mainly associated with the intrinsic regenerative
response of neurons.
Csrp1a mRNA is upregulated in neurons of regenerative nuclei
in the axon regeneration phase after spinal cord injury
The upregulation of csrp1a mRNA in individual NMLF neurons after
SCI was determined by in situ hybridization. With the sense probe, no
significant signal was observed when sections from injured animals
were used in parallel with the antisense probe, i.e. under the same
conditions. The NMLF neurons can be easily identified by their
typical location and large size (13–23 lm in diameter) (Fig. 3A)
(Wullimann et al., 1996; Becker et al., 1998, 2004), distinguishing
them from glial cells, which are characterized by their small size
(Becker et al., 1998). Signal for csrp1a mRNA was observed in
neurons in the NMLF (Figs 3 and 4). The expression of csrp1a in
neurons was further confirmed by showing double labeling of csrp1a
(in situ hybridization) and the neuronal marker NeuN (immunohisto-
chemistry) in cells of the NMLF and the IMRF (Fig. 4). The number
of csrp1a-positive neuronal profiles was strongly increased in the
NMLF at 11 days after SCI (62.7 ± 5.7, n = 6 fish, two-tailed t-test,
P = 0.001) (Fig. 3B) when compared with sham-lesioned control
(12.7 ± 1, n = 6 fish). The expression of csrp1a mRNA was also
studied in neurons from other nuclei capable of regeneration after SCI,
such as the IMRF and SRF (Becker et al., 1997). At 11 days post-
injury, the numbers of csrp1a-positive cell profiles were increased in
both the IMRF (119.3 ± 6.1, n = 3 fish, two-tailed t-test, P = 0.001,
Fig. 3) and SRF (59.3 ± 4.5, n = 3 fish, two-tailed t-test, P = 0.001,
Fig. 3) compared with sham-lesioned control (IMRF, 22.7 ± 4.3,
n = 3 fish; SRF, 16 ± 1.5, n = 3 fish). In addition to the neurons of the
regenerating nuclei studied, the expression of csrp1a was also
examined in neurons of other nuclei with no or limited capacity for
regeneration after SCI, such as Mauthner cells (Becker et al., 1997).
Interestingly, no significant upregulation of csrp1a expression was
observed in Mauthner cells at 11 days after SCI (Fig. 4), similar to the
observations on the adhesion molecule L1.1 (Becker et al., 1998),
suggesting that upregulation of csrp1a expression is specifically
associated with regeneration. The upregulation of csrp1a mRNA in
different regenerative nuclei after SCI is consistent with the prediction
that similar molecular mechanisms are shared by different nuclei for
regeneration (Becker et al., 1998).
Next, a study was performed to investigate the regulation of
csrp1a mRNA expression over time following SCI. As shown in
Table 1, the expression of csrp1a did not change from sham injury
at 4 and 12 h after axotomy, indicating that it is probably not
involved in the early response after SCI. The expression of csrp1a at
an additional two time points, 3 and 21 days after SCI, was studied
using in situ hybridization. The number of csrp1a-positive neuronal
profiles in the NMLF was slightly increased at 3 days after SCI. The
expression of csrp1a was highly upregulated at 11 days (Figs 3 and
5). This upregulation continued to 21 days post-injury (Fig. 5A, SCI,
44 ± 3.7, n = 3 fish, two-way anova followed by Tukey’s post hoc
test, P = 0.002; CON, 12.3 ± 1.8, n = 3 fish), the longest time point
studied, albeit to a lesser extent than that of 11 days post-injury.
Other nuclei capable of regeneration showed similar regulation
pattern of csrp1a expression after SCI (IMRF, Fig. 5B; SRF,
Fig. 5C). The upregulation of csrp1a mRNA in the growth phase of
descending axons suggests that it may be a critical component of the
neuron intrinsic regeneration response.
CRP1a is essential for spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish
Antisense MO oligonucleotides have been used effectively to
investigate the role of specific genes in zebrafish spinal cord
regeneration (Becker et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2011; Yu et al.,
2011a,b). Like conventional neuronal tracers, MO can be absorbed
by the injured axons at the lesion site and retrogradely transported into
neuronal somata where the protein translation of the target gene is
blocked. In the zebrafish SCI model, this can be accomplished by
placing MO-soaked Gelfoam into the spinal cord transection site. The
inhibitory effect of MO can last for at least 6 weeks (the longest time
point tested) (Becker et al., 2004). Gelfoam alone or with the standard
control MO did not show any effect on neuronal viability or spinal
cord regeneration (Becker et al., 2004).
The role of a gene in zebrafish spinal cord regeneration has been
evaluated by two definitive parameters: locomotor recovery and

axonal regrowth (Becker et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2011a,b). The total
distance moved by fish in 5 min is used to measure locomotor activity.
The locomotor activity is reduced to approximately 5% of that in
unlesioned fish at 1 week after SCI and generally recovers to 60% at
6 weeks. No additional improvement is observed after this point
(Becker et al., 2004). The identification of neurons that have
regenerated their axons beyond the lesion site is performed by
applying the retrograde tracer biocytin at 3.5 mm caudal to the
transection site at 6 weeks after the lesion. The degree of locomotor
recovery and the number of retrogradely labeled neurons reflect the
extent of spinal cord regeneration and these two parameters are usually
correlated (Becker et al., 2004).
The role of CRP1a in spinal cord regeneration was investigated
using two different MOs specific for csrp1a. The effectiveness of the
two csrp1a MOs used was examined by western blot analysis. The
CRP1 antibody used here detected only one band of the correct size
for CRP1a, demonstrating its specificity (Fig. 6A). Signal for CRP1a
was detected with samples from both brain and spinal cord, confirming
the expression of csrp1a as shown by in situ hybridization. To test the
effectiveness of csrp1a MOs, a 2 mm section of spinal cord tissue,
centered on the transection site, was collected at 11 days after MO
application and examined by western blot analysis. Both csrp1a MO1
and csrp1a MO2 exhibited effective knockdown of CRP1a expression
compared with the control MO, with a knockdown of 30% (n = 3
experiments, one-way anova followed by Tukey’s post hoc test,
P = 0.01) and 40% (n = 3 experiments, one-way anova followed by
Tukey’s post hoc test, P = 0.01), respectively (Fig. 6B and C). Thus,
both csrp1a MOs worked effectively in our system.
At 6 weeks after SCI, fish treated with csrp1a MO1 showed a
decrease in the total distance moved (278 ± 104 cm ⁄ 5 min, n = 12
fish, one-way anova followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, P = 0.003,
Fig. 6D) compared with fish treated with control MO (1108 ±
365 cm ⁄ 5 min, n = 9 fish). Csrp1a MO2 treatment exhibited a
similar effect (261 ± 97 cm ⁄ 5 min, n = 5 fish, one-way anova

followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, P = 0.008, Fig. 6D). Csrp1a MO2
has been used to knockdown CRP1a expression and its specificity has
been confirmed with a csrp1a mRNA rescue experiment (Miyasaka
et al., 2007). These data indicate that csrp1aMOs impaired locomotor
recovery. After locomotor analysis, the same fish were used to
retrogradely label neurons that had regrown their axons 3.5 mm
beyond the lesion site. The number of neuronal profiles retrogradely
labeled in the NMLF was reduced in animals treated with csrp1aMO1
(11 ± 2.3, n = 12 fish, one-way anova followed by Tukey’s post hoc
test, P = 0.001) or csrp1a MO2 (13.2 ± 4.3, n = 5 fish, one-way
anova followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, P = 0.01) compared with
fish treated with control MO (27.7 ± 2.9, n = 10 fish) (Fig. 7A and

hybridization) and NeuN (immunohistochemistry) was performed to determine the identity of csrp1a-positive cells. The signal for NeuN locates in the nucleus and
csrp1a locates in the cytoplasm. Cells positive for csrp1a mRNA are also labeled by NeuN, demonstrating that csrp1a is expressed by neurons. More double-
labeling cells are observed at 11 days after SCI in regenerative nuclei, such as the NMLF (upper two rows) and IMRF (middle two rows), when compared with
control, whereas no significant upregulation of csrp1a expression is found after SCI in Mauthner cells (lower two rows), which are not capable of regenerating after
SCI. n = 3 experiments. Scale bar, 50 lm.

6.8 ± 1.8, n = 4 fish, one-way anova followed by Tukey’s post

anova followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, P = 0.03; CON MO,
25 ± 6.6, n = 3 fish). These data suggest that knockdown of CRP1a
inhibits locomotor recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI.
We then asked whether the reduced number of neuronal profiles
retrogradely labeled is due to reduced cell viability after MO
application. In this study, both the standard MO and csrp1a MO1
were tagged with fluorescein, which does not affect cell viability and
spinal cord regeneration (Becker et al., 2004). No effect on cell
viability by csrp1a MO2 has been reported (Miyasaka et al., 2007).
Because of the inappropriateness of csrp1a MO2 being coupled with
the fluorescein tag due to its high G content, it is not included in this
experiment. In agreement with previous findings (Becker et al., 2004),

regulation pattern of csrp1a mRNA expression after SCI. Three different time
points were included: 3, 11 and 21 days after SCI. Quantification shows that
csrp1a mRNA is slightly upregulated at 3 days. The expression of csrp1a
mRNA is highly induced at 11 days post-injury and this upregulation continues
to 21 days, the longest time point tested. Similar regulation patterns of csrp1a

the fluorescein tag signal on the MOs was still detectable in the NMLF
neurons at 6 weeks after application. As standard control MO does not
show an effect on cell viability (Becker et al., 2004), we compared the
number of fluorescein-positive cell profiles from csrp1a MO1-treated
fish with that from control MO-treated fish. No difference was found
in the numbers of fluorescein-positive cell profiles in the NMLF
between control and experimental animals (control MO, 25 ± 3.8,
n = 3 fish; csrp1a MO1, 24 ± 4.8, n = 4 fish, two-tailed t-test,
P = 0.85) (Fig. 8), indicating that neurons survived the csrp1a MO1
and control MO applications equally well. Similar results were
observed in the IMRF and SRF (data not shown). In all, the combined
observations showed reduced locomotor recovery and reduced
numbers of retrogradely labeled NMLF neurons in animals treated
with csrp1a MO, indicating that CRP1a is required for successful
spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish.
Discussion
Unlike mammals, adult zebrafish have the innate ability to (re)express
growth-associated genes and regenerate descending axons after SCI
leading to locomotor recovery (Becker et al., 1997, 1998, 2004;
Bernhardt, 1999). However, the molecular mechanisms for successful
spinal cord regeneration have not been fully explored. In the current
study, microarray analysis was used to obtain an exploratory list of

retrogradely labeled neuronal profiles in the NMLF, IMRF and SRF (biocytin label) is measured at 6 weeks after SCI and MO application. Biocytin was applied at

potential growth-associated genes from regenerating NMLF. Among
the potentially upregulated genes during the axon regeneration phase,
several have been reported to be induced during the regeneration period
after nerve injury (Veldman et al., 2007; McCurley & Callard, 2010;
Saul et al., 2010; Siebert et al., 2010), such as matrix metalloprotein-
ase 9, GAP-43, activating transcription factor 3, tubulin beta 5 and
suppressor of cytokine signaling 3b, supporting the validity of this
analysis. Furthermore, some of the identified genes appear to be
specifically regulated in adult vertebrates competent for spinal cord
regeneration. Decorin is a small, leucine-rich proteoglycan that has
previously been shown to promote axon growth across adult rat SCIs
(Davies et al., 2004). Decorin also promotes robust axon growth on
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and myelin (Minor et al., 2008), two
major inhibitory factors for axon regeneration within the adult
mammalian central nervous system (Morgenstern et al., 2002; Yiu &
He, 2006). Our microarray shows that decorin is probably upregulated
during the axonal regeneration period after SCI in adult zebrafish
(11 days). However, to the best of our knowledge, the upregulation of
decorin has not been reported in other microarray analysis after nerve
injury in adult mammals (Veldman et al., 2007; McCurley & Callard,
2010; Saul et al., 2010; Siebert et al., 2010; Gibbs et al., 2011),
indicating it as one of the specific genes involved in spinal cord
regeneration. However, L1.1, a well-known adhesion molecule for
axon regeneration, was not found on our list. Although our microarray
analysis showed a 1.82-fold change for L1.1 at 11 days after SCI, the
result was not significant when compared with the control group (with
0.42 for the P value), probably due to a combination of measurement
variability, low signal, and the limited number of replicates. Variability
could be due to the limited number of regenerative neurons in the tissue
sample, the presence of other non-regenerative cells and the possible
technical variation added by the two-step RNA amplification proce-
dures involved in RNA preparation for microarray. Due to these
limitations, our list may not include all of the upregulated mRNAs after
SCI.
Quantitative PCR confirms predictions from the microarray,
showing that both GAP-43 and csrp1a are upregulated in the
regenerating NMLF during the growth phase after SCI. Similarly,
upregulation of CRP1 has also been reported in heart regeneration
(Lien et al., 2006), fin regeneration (Schebesta et al., 2006) and optic
nerve regeneration (McCurley & Callard, 2010), indicating CRP1
expression as a common molecular mechanism for regeneration. The
upregulation of csrp1a in neurons in several regenerative nuclei after
axotomy was confirmed by in situ hybridization. In vivo knockdown
of CRP1a expression with specific MOs impaired both locomotor
recovery and axon regeneration, demonstrating that CRP1a upregu-
lation is an essential part of the natural regeneration mechanism in
spinal cord-injured adult zebrafish. Successful spinal cord regeneration
requires at least two critical factors: the ability of an injured neuron to
regrow its axon and a supportive extracellular environment for axon
regeneration (Bulsara et al., 2002). In addition, rearrangements of the
intraspinal connections of interneurons involving pre-synaptic and
post-synaptic structures need to be considered (Guo et al., 2011).
Interestingly, csrp1a levels are only upregulated in the cell bodies of
neurons regenerating axons, but not in the caudal part of the spinal
cord, into which the severed axons regrow. This suggests that the
upregulation of CRP1a is only associated with the neuron-intrinsic
regeneration response and its upregulation is not required in the
extrinsic response that generates a permissive environment for axon
regeneration. Thus, we propose that the effect of csrp1a MOs on
spinal cord regeneration is mainly due to the loss of CRP1a expression
in those neurons that regrow their severed axons.
As a Lin11, Isl-1 and Mec-3-domain protein, CRP1 plays a role in
many different functions, such as gene transcription, cell movements,
and cell proliferation (Chang et al., 2003; Miyasaka et al., 2007;
Latonen et al., 2008). The amino acid sequence of CRP1 is very
similar among vertebrates with more than 80% identity between
human, mouse, rat, chicken, quail and zebrafish, suggesting its
conserved function over evolution (McLaughlin et al., 1994). It has
been reported that CRP1 binds actin filaments directly and cross-links
them to generate actin bundles (Tran et al., 2005; Jang & Greenwood,
2009). Actin bundles are the major component of filopodia at the
leading edge of growth cones. Filopodia formation is critical for
neurite outgrowth, neuritogenesis, neurite branching and spine
formation in neurons (Mattila & Lappalainen, 2008). Expression of
CRP1 in filopodia of growth cones and colocalization with actin
filaments was observed by indirect immunofluorescence in cultured rat
hippocampal neurons (Ma et al., 2011), which is consistent with its
reported actin-bundling ability (Tran et al., 2005; Jang & Greenwood,
2009). Therefore, we propose that the role of CRP1a in spinal cord
regeneration is probably due to its actin-bundling activity in filopodia
formation. As filopodia formation affects several different aspects of
neurite modeling, such as axon outgrowth (Kwiatkowski et al., 2007),
neuritogenesis (Dent et al., 2007) and neurite branching (Dailey &
Smith, 1996), one or more of the aspects mentioned above may
contribute to the requirement of CRP1a in spinal cord regeneration in
zebrafish.
In addition to the interaction of CRP1 with the cytoskeleton, the
involvement of CRP1 in other pathways has been reported. For
example, it has been shown that CRP1 is involved in activation of the
c-jun N-terminal kinase pathway and interacts with Diversin and

Dishevelled 2 (Miyasaka et al., 2007). Moreover, it has been reported
that CRP1 acts as a cofactor together with SRF to activate the
transcription of target genes in smooth muscle (Chang et al., 2003).
Further investigations are needed to elucidate whether these mecha-
nisms of CRP1 underlie successful spinal cord regeneration in
zebrafish.
