Abstract Gekko japonicus undergoes dramatic changes
in the caudal spinal cord after tail amputation. The ampu-
tation induces cell proliferation in the caudal ependymal
tube. We performed hematoxylin and eosin staining at
different time points in the regeneration process to inves-
tigate the morphological characterization of the regener-
ated appendages. The central canal extended to the
blastema post-amputation and the cartilage and muscle
tissue appeared 3 weeks after injury. We performed the
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay to detect
proliferating cells during the regeneration process. BrdU
positive cells were detected in the peri-central canal. Fur-
thermore, nestin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE)
immunocytochemistry were applied to detect neural stem/
progenitor cells and neurons. Two weeks after injury,
nestin-positive cells undergoing proliferation were located
outside of the ependymal tube, and NSE positive cells
appeared after 3 weeks of amputation. These data suggest
that neurogenesis is an early event during caudal spinal
cord regeneration in gecko.

Introduction
Among amniotes, the most striking example of epimorphic
regeneration comes from tail regeneration in lizards. Gekko
japonicus, a species belonging to the Gekkonidae family,
Sauria (lizard) suborder, lives mainly in China and Japan
(Du et al. 2002). Geckos have a remarkable ability to
regenerate their tails, and the regeneration mainly includes
the skin, muscle, skeleton and nerve system. The most
amazing issue is the nascent tail can regenerate the spinal
cord and then restore the related function (McLean and
Vickaryous 2011). The spinal cord regeneration has been
extensively reported in many species, including adult fish,
urodele amphibians, and lizard tails (Anderson et al. 1986;
Sirbulescu and Zupanc 2011; Dawley et al. 2012; Duffy
et al. 1992). Generally, the related respects of the regen-
eration contain axonal regrowth, neurogenesis and glial
responses, while the situation is varied in different species.
In the urodele amphibian, regeneration of the spinal cord
can occur after tail amputation, and the differentiation of
neural cells, axonal growth, and establishment of appro-
priate connection with their targets is usually complete
within a few weeks (Dawley et al. 2012). The neurogenesis
in the regenerates was regarded to originate from the radial
glia cells lining the ependymal canal, which had been
examined using either clonal cell cultures from the adult
SC, cell labeling and in situ cell re-implantation, or in situ
cell labeling using the biolistic technique (Benraiss et al.
1996, 1997). In addition, some researchers have shown that
the nascently differentiated Schwann cells and melanocytes
could be observed in regenerated tail which indicated the
repair of peripheral nervous system after amputation
(Benraiss et al. 1999). In reptile, most reports documented
axonal regrowth during trauma-induced tail regeneration.
In lizards that undergo regeneration, the regenerating

nervous system was reported to be composed of the
ependymal tube and axons derived from the proximal
portion of the original spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia
(Cox 1969; Alibardi 2010; McLean and Vickaryous 2011).
However, a few studies also demonstrated the neurogenesis
during regeneration in lizards (Molowny et al. 1995). Our
question is how about the situation in Gekko japonicas?
Whether the axon descending from the proximal spinal
cord was occurred in the regenerated tail of gecko? In
further, does neurogenesis occur during regeneration? If so,
how and when does the neurogenesis occur? In present
study, we first investigated the morphological changes of
spinal cord during tail regeneration, then detected the
location of proliferative cells and the neural stem/progen-
itor cells in the regenerates, and finally observed axon
growth and neurogenesis at different time points after
amputation. Our findings support the view that neurogen-
esis is an early event during caudal spinal cord regeneration
in geckos.
Materials and methods
Animals
Adult geckos were wild caught and cultured in the labo-
ratory animal center of Nantong University. At the start of
the experiment, they were mature individuals and all were
3 ± 0.5 g in weight with an average total body length
(snout to vent plus tail) of 520 mm, including males and
females. They were freely fed with mealworms and water
in homemade cages with hollow bricks, as well as hay,
leaves, imitating natural gecko accommodation environ-
ment, and housed in an air-conditioned room with con-
trolled temperature (22–25 C) and saturated humidity. All
experimental protocols pertinent to animals were given
prior approval by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Nantong University. We minimized the
number of animals used and used cooling anesthesia to
reduce their suffering. The tail amputation of adult Gekko
japonicus was performed according to previously pub-
lished methods (Jiang et al. 2009). Briefly, the caudatomy
was conducted by inserting a nylon slipknot at the site of
the sixth tail segment and pulling gently, which mimics the
conditions of autotomy in the natural environment of these
lizards (Bryant and Bellairs 1970).
Administration of BrdU and tissue collection
In order to label the population of mitotically active cells in
tail regenerates, especially in the regenerating caudal SC,
animals were injected with BrdU (5-bromo-20-deoxyuri-
dine, Sigma). BrdU is incorporated into the DNA of
dividing cells during S phase and can be visualized using
immunohistochemistry. Geckos were anesthetized on ice
and injected intraperitoneally with BrdU diluted in physi-
ological saline at a dose of 2 g/kg for 3 days. Three days
after the BrdU injections, the geckos were anesthetized
with ethyl ether and perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde
and then normal and regenerated tail from perfused geckos
were removed with the adjacent stump regions and fixed
overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde (pH 7.0). Tissues were
then dehydrated in a 10–30 % sucrose gradient in phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and 12 lm thick
sections from normal and regenerated tail were cut on a
cryostat, thaw mounted onto polylysine-coated slides, and
stored at -20 C until staining was performed.
Histochemistry
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were used to identify
the tissue and cellular compositions of the tails (Fischer et al.
2008). Briefly, sections were rinsed with deionized water
(ddH2O; 5 min) and stained in Mayer’s hematoxylin
(30 min) and rinsed in running water (5 min), 70 % ethanol
for 1.5 min (10 drops of concentrated HCl in 200 ml 70 %
ethanol) and bluing solution (10 drops of NH4OH in 200 ml
ethanol, 1 min). Slides were dehydrated through three
changes of 50 % ethanol (5 min), 70 % ethanol (5 min) and
80 % ethanol (5 min). Sections were stained in eosin
(1 min), and then dehydrated through 95 % ethanol (5 min),
three changes of absolute ethanol (5 min each), and three
changes of xylene (5 min each), prior to coverslipping.
Immunohistochemistry
To determine the cell lineage of the proliferating ependy-
mal cells, double-staining experiments were performed
using an anti-BrdU antibody with anti-nestin or anti-NSE
antibodies. Eight geckos were used/sampled for each of the
BrdU, nestin and NSE components, divided into two
groups of four, a group was used to detect BrdU and nestin,
the other group used to detect BrdU and NSE. We mainly
examined sections at the sixth tail segments which is
adjacent to the amputation plane, and they demonstrate
similar immunostaining pattern. For immunohistochemical
detection of BrdU, the tissue sections were quenched with
3 % hydrogen peroxide in ddH20 for 10 min to eliminate
endogenous peroxidases, then subsequently incubated in
2 N HCl and 0.5 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at
37 C to denature the DNA. The sections were rinsed in
0.1 M sodium tetraborate, pH 8.5. Nonspecific sites were
blocked in 10 % bovine serum albumin in PBS at room
temperature for at least 2 h. The sections were incubated
overnight at 4 C in a humidified chamber with anti-BrdU
antibody at 1:50 dilution in PBS. After washing with PBS,

anti-NSE (ProSci Company) or anti-nestin (ProSci Com-
pany), antibodies were applied at 1:200 dilution for 16 h at
4 C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate or tetramethyl rhodamine-
conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, and Texas red
conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen) at 1:200 dilution
were used as secondary antibodies. Representative sections
were observed with epifluorescence on a Leica microscope.
Results
Morphological characterization of the normal spinal
cord of adult Gekko japonicus
The normal tail of adult Gekko japonicus is a prominent
and complex appendage composed of multiple tissues
including spinal cord, muscle, vasculature, adipose tissue,
and a bony vertebral column. Like other lizards, the most
notable feature of Gekko japonicus is its ability to volun-
tarily shed or autotomize their tail as a strategy to escape
predation (Dawley et al. 2012).
The gecko’s spinal cord extends through the tail and the
caudal marrow can divide into 27–33 segments, which varies
due to individual differences. The length of each segment is
approximately 2 mm, and the shape is similar between
adjacent segments. The cross-sectional area of the gecko tail
decreases from the proximal to the distal tip. The spinal cord
shape at C6 was semi-circular and gradually narrowed to
triangular. The boundaries between white matter and gray
matter are clear, while the peripheral area of connective
tissue gradually decreased; connective tissue disappeared at
the C27 segment. The spinal cord and cartilage tissue are
surrounded by the muscles and skin (Fig. 1).
Morphological and histological changes of spinal cord-
like tissue of the regenerate tail at different times
The tails of healthy adult geckos were amputated at the site
of the sixth tail segment, and for each time point, 20
individuals were used for the experiment. Two days after
amputation, the stump surface is gradually reduced by
contraction of the adjacent epidermis. At the same time,

the gecko tail gradually decreases in size from the proximal to the
distal end, the spinal cord is centrally positioned within the central
canal, the notochord is located ventral to the spinal cord, and
surrounding the notochord are bands of adipose tissue and skeletal
muscle. The shape of the spinal cord at C6 was semi-circular a, and
gradually narrowed to triangular (b, c). The boundaries between white
matter and gray matter are clear, while the peripheral area of
connective tissue decreased. Connective tissue completely disap-
peared at the C27 segment and the spinal cord and skeleton are

blood clots formed across the autotomy surface. Wound
healing begins immediately following the formation of the
clot and the wound epithelium. Two weeks after injury,
regeneration tail can be seen in the caudal stump (Fig. 2),
and the average length of the regenerates of 20 geckos is
1.61 ± 0.72 mm (mean ± SD) and varies among geckos.
A central canal-like structure could be observed among
new buds, but its lumen is larger than the central canal of

the normal spinal cord. Three weeks after amputation, the
tail had gradually grown, and the average length of the
regenerates of 20 geckos reached 7.51 ± 1.85 mm
(mean ± SD). The central structure can be seen clearly in
new tail tissue where a layer of ependymal cells were
arranged around the lumen, and boundaries of connective
tissue were clear (Fig. 2B2). The cross-sectional area of
tail was gradually reduced from the proximal to the distal
end, but different segments retained a similar shape. The
most notable cell population is ependymal cells around the
central tube, it may containing the radial glia cells, dif-
ferentiated tanycytes or neural precursor cells, and the
component is varied at the different stage of regeneration,
the morphological characteristic of these cells had been
described in other lizard (Alibardi et al. 1992; Egar et al.
1970). In our present data, the elaborate structures of these
cells were not available yet, and it will be addressed in the
future investigation.
Neurogenesis during caudal spinal cord regeneration
We performed the BrdU labeling experiment to visualize
dividing cells of the regenerated tail. BrdU labeling con-
sisted of a single intraperitoneal administration of BrdU in
saline solution to animals that had been regenerating their
SC for 2–3 weeks, and the regenerates were removed and
fixed as described above in the methods section. Double-
labeling experiments were performed with an anti-BrdU
antibody to detect dividing cells in combination with either
an anti-Nestin antibody to detect neural stem/progenitor
cells or an anti-NSE antibody to label neurons. BrdU-
labeled cells were seen close to the ependymal tube in both
the terminal vesicle and the median region of the regen-
erating tube. The central canal extended to the regenerated
tail and most cells were proliferating in the spinal cord
extension tissue (Fig. 3).
At the rostral and median levels of the ependymal tube,
two types of cells were detected according to the labeled
specific cell markers. Analysis of dividing cells in double
immunostaining experiments with anti-BrdU and anti-
nestin or anti-NSE antibodies demonstrated the location of
the proliferating stem cells and neurons. Two weeks after
injury, nestin-positive cells were distributed in the
periphery of the ependymal cell region (Fig. 4A), indicat-
ing that neural stem/progenitor cells were rich around the
central canal. However, nestin-positive cells were reduced
at 3 weeks, and the descending axon was observed sur-
rounding the central canal, which showed NSE staining
Fig. 4 The expression of Nestin and NSE varied at the sixth caudal
vertebrae in the regenerating tail. Cells whose nuclei have incorpo-
rated Brdu (green) are seen close to the central canal, and weak NSE
staining (red) is present around the central canal without overlapping
with the Brdu positive cells in 2 week-old regenerating tail (A, A1,
A2). The number of NSE-positive cells (red) increased and distrib-
uted in the periphery of central canal after 3 weeks (B, B1, B2) and
4 weeks (C, C1, C2). Nestin-positive cells (red) distributed in the
central canal of 2 week-old regenerating tail (D, D1, D2) and co-
localized with incorporated BrdU (green), as time increases, the
expression of Nestin becomes weak at 3 weeks (E, E1, E2) and
4 weeks (F, F1, F2), wherein D0, D10 and D20 is an enlarged view of
D, D1 and D2, respectively. G and H show the immunostaining of
NSE and nestin in normal spinal cord, respectively. (Color figure

without nucleus (Fig. 4B). In addition, NSE positive cells
appeared outside the descending axon (Fig. 5) as well,
which indicates that neurogenesis also occurred during the
process. Our data support the view that regenerated axons
derived from the original spinal cord and dorsal root gan-
glia might contribute to the re-innervation of the regener-
ated tail. Furthermore, we show that the neural stem/
progenitor cells were present in the newly formed tissue in
the early stage and the NSE positive cells appeared in the
later stage, which indicated neurogenesis may play a role in
the re-innervation of the regenerated tail as well.
Discussion
Epimorphic regeneration is a post-traumatic morphoge-
netic event beginning with the formation of a cellular
aggregation (reportedly a blastema) at the wound site and
developing a replacement appendage that can restore lost
tissues and structures (Kierdorf and Kierdorf 2012). Tail
regeneration in Gekko japonicus follows a conserved
sequence of morphological and histological events com-
parable with observations made on other lizards (Cristino
et al. 2000; Simpson 1968; Rumping and Jayne 1996;
Alibardi 2010). Generally, the tail regeneration process can
be divided into three stages: wound healing, blastema
formation, and growth of the new tail. The tail of the gecko
is a prominent and complex appendage composed of
multiple tissue types, including striated muscle, vascula-
ture, bony vertebral column, spinal cord, and noto-
chord(Cristino et al. 2000). The spinal cord regeneration
after tail amputation was the most amazing issue, and it has
been extensively reported in many species. In the fish
Apteronotus (Sternarchus) albifrons, ependymal cells in the
adult retain the ability to incorporate thymidine and
undergo neural differentiation (Anderson and Waxman
1985; Anderson et al. 1994). In amphibians, Benraiss et al.
(1997) suggested that new neurons could be generated from
some of the ependymal cells within the mature SC. In
reptiles, the new spinal cord of the original tail is composed
of ependymal tube and descending nerves (Simpson 1968;
Rumping and Jayne 1996; Alibardi 2010), and there are
also convincing data about neurogenesis occurring in the
new tail (Simpson and Duffy 1994). Interestingly, Kehl
et al. (1997) also observed cell proliferation and neural
differentiation from the postnatal rat SC in primary culture.
Another aspect to be concerned is the cell source of neu-
rogenesis. It is now generally accepted that the adult ner-
vous system contains multi-potential precursors for
neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (McKay 1997).
Are these cells actually newly generated cells or do they
come from cell de-differentiation, which had been

extensively investigated in the regeneration of muscle tis-
sue (Ding and Schultz 2004). Such a similar recycling
process could be involved for neural cells in the SC as well.
Lin and Matesic (1994) showed that after injury in the adult
rodent forebrain, astrocytes may re-express fetal traits of
early differentiating glial cells/neurons. We cannot rule out
both possibilities for the neurogenesis that occurred in the
present study. In conclusion, our results show that the adult
gecko SC retains the capacity to have neurogenesis in the
regenerating ependymal tube of the nascent tail.
