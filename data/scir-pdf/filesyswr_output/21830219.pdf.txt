ABSTRACT
Monoaminergic innervation of the spinal cord has im-
portant modulatory functions for locomotion. Here we
performed a quantitative study to determine the plastic
changes of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH1þ; mainly
dopaminergic), and serotonergic (5-HTþ) terminals and
cells during successful spinal cord regeneration in adult
zebrafish. TH1þ innervation in the spinal cord is derived
from the brain. After spinal cord transection, TH1þ im-
munoreactivity is completely lost from the caudal spinal
cord. Terminal varicosities increase in density rostral to
the lesion site compared with unlesioned controls and
are re-established in the caudal spinal cord at 6 weeks
post lesion. Interestingly, axons mostly fail to re-inner-
vate more caudal levels of the spinal cord even after
prolonged survival times. However, densities of terminal
varicosities correlate with recovery of swimming behav-
ior, which is completely lost again after re-lesion of the
spinal cord. Similar observations were made for termi-
nals derived from descending 5-HTþ axons from the
brain. In addition, spinal 5-HTþ neurons were newly
generated after a lesion and transiently increased in
number up to fivefold, which depended in part on
hedgehog signaling. Overall, TH1þ and 5-HTþ innerva-
tion is massively altered in the successfully regenerated
spinal cord of adult zebrafish. Despite these changes in
TH and 5-HT systems, a remarkable recovery of swim-
ming capability is achieved, suggesting significant plas-
ticity of the adult spinal network during regeneration.

Adult zebrafish, in contrast to mammals, are capable of
successful spinal cord regeneration, such that plastic
changes in cellular and axonal compartments that are
associated with functional regeneration can be studied in
this genetically tractable vertebrate (Becker and Becker,
2007). We have previously shown that the number of
supraspinal neurons that grow axons beyond a spinal
lesion site correlates with recovery of swimming capabil-
ity (Becker et al., 1997). Moreover, when regeneration
over a spinal lesion site in goldfish (Bernstein and Bern-
stein, 1969) or zebrafish is mechanically blocked, no
recovery occurs. The same is true when re-growth of
descending axons is selectively compromised by knock
down of L1.1, a cell recognition molecule necessary for
axon re-growth (Becker et al., 2004). Thus axon re-growth
beyond the lesion site is crucial for recovery from a spinal
lesion. However, recovery is seen in eel (Doyle et al.,
2001) and lamprey (McClellan, 1994) already when axons
have only grown for a short distance into the distal cord,
indicating that the spinal circuitry can produce swimming
patterns without complete re-innervation of the distal
cord.
In addition, a lesion induces neurogenesis in the spinal
cord of teleost fish (for a recent review, see Sirbulescu
and Zupanc, 2010), including zebrafish (Reimer et al.,
2008). Elucidating the changes that specific axon termi-
nal and cellular systems undergo during regeneration on
a quantitative basis may help to gauge the magnitude of
overall plasticity that leads to the remarkable functional
recovery in adult zebrafish after a spinal lesion.

RESEARCH ARTICLE
We decided to study changes in the dopaminergic and
serotonergic systems, because both of these have been
shown to critically influence the output of the spinal central
pattern generator for locomotion (reviewed in Grillner and
Jessell, 2009; Jordan et al., 2008). In larval zebrafish, dopa-
minergic innervation of the spinal cord is derived exclu-
sively from the diencephalon (Kastenhuber et al., 2010;
McLean and Fetcho, 2004). Dopamine suppresses initia-
tion of swimming in pre-feeding larvae (Thirumalai and
Cline, 2008), and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, act-
ing as an antagonist of the D4 receptor in zebrafish, causes
hypoactivity in older embryos (Boehmler et al., 2007). In
larval lampreys, dopamine inhibits glutamatergic reticulo-
spinal transmission (Svensson et al., 2003) and increases
or decreases fictive swimming frequency in a dose-
dependent manner (McPherson and Kemnitz, 1994).
Serotonergic innervation of the spinal cord originates
from supraspinal raphe neurons (Lillesaar et al., 2009) and
from spinal intrinsic neurons (van Raamsdonk et al., 1996)
in adult zebrafish. Endogenous serotonin decreases the
frequency of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced loco-
motor rhythms in fictive swimming of adult zebrafish spinal
cord preparations by increasing mid-cycle inhibitory post-
synaptic potentials and delaying the subsequent onset of
hyperpolarization (Gabriel et al., 2009). Moreover, sero-
tonin has been shown to directly modulate firing patterns
of rat motor neurons (Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 2001).
Previous work has presented evidence for regeneration
of dopaminergic and serotonergic axons in the spinal cord
of zebrafish (van Raamsdonk et al., 1998). Also, in the spi-
nal cord of the sea lamprey, regeneration of serotonergic
descending axons has been reported (Cornide-Petronio
et al., 2011). In addition, there is lesion-induced generation
of serotonergic cells in the spinal cord of the closely related
goldfish (Takeda et al., 2008). However, quantitative analy-
ses of terminal densities necessary for a comparison of the
potential functionality of the regenerated with the unle-
sioned situation are missing. We find that both dopaminer-
gic and serotonergic systems undergo massive changes
after a spinal lesion, with several anatomical parameters
not returning to levels observed in unlesioned animals even
after prolonged survival times. These changes include
hyper-innervation of the rostral spinal cord, reduced
re-innervation of the caudal spinal cord, and a lack of
re-growth to more caudal levels for both systems. This sug-
gests that considerable plasticity of the locomotor network
occurs, leading to recovery of swimming function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All fish were kept and bred in our laboratory fish facility
according to standard methods (Westerfield, 1989), and
all experimental procedures were approved by the British
Home Office. We used wild-type (wik; ZFIN.org) and two
transgenic lines.
To generate the olig2 reporter line tg(olig2:GFP)
(Shin et al., 2003), a large bacterial artificial chromosome
containing the olig2 promoter was used, increasing the
likelihood of faithful reporter gene expression. We have
previously shown by in situ hybridization for olig2 that
the transgene accurately reports olig2-expressing cells in
the lesioned adult spinal cord (Reimer et al., 2009).
We also used tg(shha:GFP) (Shkumatava et al., 2004).
This sonic hedgehog (shh) reporter line was generated by
using 2.2 kb upstream of the start codon followed by
sequences coding for gfp with a polyA signal. This was fol-
lowed by a NotI/KpnI fragment of the shh locus (between
þ553 to þ5,631) containing intron 1, exon 2, and intron
2. By using in situ hybridization for shh, we have previ-
ously shown that the transgene accurately reports shh
expression in the adult lesioned spinal cord (Reimer
et al., 2009). For simplicity, the lines are designated
olig2:GFP and shh:GFP in this article.
Spinal lesion and intraperitoneal injections
of substances
Lesions were performed as previously described
(Becker et al., 1997). Fish were anesthetized in 0.033%
aminobenzoic acid ethyl methyl ester (MS222; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO). A longitudinal incision was made at the side
of the fish to expose the vertebral column. The spinal
cord was completely transected 3.5 mm caudal to the
brainstem–spinal cord junction under visual control.
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, B9285, Sigma) was injected
intraperitoneally at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in a vol-
ume of 25 ll phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at
0, 2, and 4 days post lesion (dpl), as described (Reimer
et al., 2008). Analysis took place at 2 or at 6 weeks post
lesion (wpl).
Cyclopamine (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) and the
chemically related control substance tomatidine (Sigma)
were injected at 10 mg/kg bodyweight at 3, 6, and 9 dpl,
as previously described (Reimer et al., 2009). Analysis
took place at 42 dpl.
Immunohistochemistry
Antibody characterization
See Table 1 for the antibodies used. The anti-BrdU as-
cites labeled cell nuclei in the lesioned spinal cord only af-
ter prior incubation with BrdU. Thus, it does not cross-
react nonspecifically with other antigens in the tissue of
interest.
The anti-GFP serum specifically labels cellular struc-
tures only in green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic

animals. Moreover, the labeling patterns are highly differ-
ential, e.g., in shh:GFP transgenic animals, only ventral
ependymo-radial glial cells are labeled, and no ectopic
labeling is detectable, demonstrating specific detection
of the transgene.
Immunolabeling of the tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (TH1)
antibody in embryos is abolished after antisense morpho-
lino-mediated knockdown of th1 in the embryonic zebra-
fish central nervous system (CNS; data not shown),
strongly supporting specific labeling of TH1 by the anti-
body. The TH1 antibody has been shown to label exclu-
sively TH1 protein in the zebrafish CNS (Chen et al.,
2009). Chen et al. (2009) combined in situ hybridization
for th1 or th2, respectively, with immunohistochemical
labeling by using the anti-TH1 antibody and found co-
localization with th1, but not th2 mRNA expression sites.
Labeling of the dopamine antiserum used was abolished
in the brain of the teleost Clarias gariepinus by preincuba-
tion with dopamine, but not other monoamines (Corio
et al., 1991). Recently, the serum was used to label dopa-
minergic axons in the brain of adult zebrafish (Yamamoto
et al., 2011). Our labeling of circuitous fibers with numer-
ous protrusions in the spinal cord was comparable to the
labeling patterns of terminals found by Yamamoto et al.
(2011). Importantly, we show a high degree of co-localiza-
tion of dopamine with TH1 in double immunohistochemis-
try, which is to be expected, given that tyrosine hydroxy-
lase is the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis.
Preincubation of the anti-serotonin (5-HT) serum with
104 mol/L 5-HT abolished labeling in zebrafish tissue,
thereby indicating specificity of the antiserum (Olsson
et al., 2008).
The SV2 antiserum recognizes a highly conserved epi-
tope in groups ranging from elasmobranches to mammals
and shows glycosylated bands in Western blots between
75 and 85 kDa (Buckley and Kelly, 1985). The antibody is
widely used in zebrafish (for example, Jing et al., 2009;
Jonz and Nurse, 2003; Neill et al., 2004) and labels, for
example, presynaptic terminals of motor axons, as deter-
mined by labeling of the postsynapse with bungarotoxin.
When synapse formation is compromised in mutant
zebrafish, SV2 labeling is absent (Boon et al., 2009), sup-
porting specific labeling of the antibody. In agreement
with our own observations, labeling was particular intense
in ventral and dorsal horns of the spinal cord of rats using
this antibody (Buckley and Kelly, 1985).
The synaptophysin antiserum recognizes a single band
of approximately 40 kDa in Western blots of mouse brain,
rat brain, and PC12 cells according to the manufacturer’s
datasheet. In adult zebrafish, the antibody labels in a
punctate pattern only in synaptic areas, which is very sim-
ilar to that of SV2, supporting specific labeling.
Immunhistochemical procedures
Immunohistochemistry on 50-lm vibrating blade
microtome sections has been described (Reimer et al.,
2009), and followed the following protocol for most anti-
bodies. Deeply anesthetized (0.1% MS222 for more than
5 minutes) fish were transcardially perfused with 4% para-
formaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and postfixed in PFA over-
night. If not stated otherwise, washing steps were 5
minutes at room temperature (RT). After transcardial per-
fusion, spinal cords or brains were embedded in agar (4%
in PBS) and cut into 50-lm-thick sections on the Vibra-
tome, and sections were collected in 24-well plates in
PBS. For labeling of synaptophysin, antigen retrieval was
performed by incubation at 80C in citrate buffer (10 mM
sodium citrate in PBS, pH 6.0) for 30 minutes. After

washing in PBS/ 0.1% Triton-X 100 (PBStx-0.1), sections
were incubated in 50 mM glycine in PBStx-0.1 for 10
minutes followed by another 15-minute wash step in
PBStx-0.1. For blocking, sections were incubated in either
1.5% donkey c-globulin (synaptophysin labeling only) or
normal goat serum for 30 minutes.
Incubation with one or two different primary antibodies
in PBStx-0.1 was performed overnight or for 40 hours
(synaptophysin labeling only) at 4C. Subsequently sec-
tions were incubated with secondary antibodies (diluted
1:200; secondary Cy2-, Cy3-, and Cy5-conjugated anti-
bodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA). Finally, the sections were mounted in
90% glycerol/PBS. Specific binding of the secondary anti-
body was controlled for by leaving out the primary anti-
body in alternating sections.
To detect BrdU, sections were washed in PBS/0.5% Tri-
ton-X-100 (PBStx-0.5) for 1 hour at RT, 3X in PBS, and 1X
with HCl 37% diluted 1:8 in H20. Then sections were incu-
bated in the diluted HCl at 37C in the waterbath for
20 minutes. After washing 6X in PBS, sections were incu-
bated in 50 mM glycine in PBS/0.3% Triton X-100 (PBStx-
0.3) for 10 minutes followed by another 15-minute wash
in PBStx-0.3. From here on, blocking and antibody incu-
bations were performed as described above, except for
the use of PBStx-0.3 instead of PBStx-0.1.
For simultaneous detection of dopamine and TH1, pri-
mary and secondary antibodies were simultaneously
applied, and a modified protocol was used for primary anti-
body incubation: floating sections of spinal cords (50 lm in
thickness) of perfusion-fixed animals (2% PFA/2.5% glutar-
aldehyde, 1% metabisulfite) were washed in PBS/1% meta-
bisulfite (pH adjusted to 7.4) with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS
Mb Tx) for 15 minutes twice. Then sections were incubated
in 0.1% NaBH4 in twice distilled water for 30 minutes fol-
lowed by two washing steps of 15 minutes each with PBS
Mb Tx. Sections were blocked in 1.5% normal goat serum
in PBS Mb Tx for 30 minutes. Then primary antibodies were
diluted in PBS Mb Tx and incubated with the sections over-
night at 4C. Secondary antibody incubation followed the
standard protocol. For documentation and analysis, we
used either a Zeiss LSM 510 or a Zeiss 750 LSM confocal
microscope with 20 and 63 oil lenses.
In situ hybridization
The method for nonradioactive in situ hybridization on
50-lm vibrating blade microtome sections (Lieberoth
et al., 2003) and the plasmids to generate probes for th2
(Filippi et al., 2010) have been described. Solutions were
made up with RNAse-free water. If not stated otherwise,
washing steps were 5 minutes long.
Sections of PFA-fixed tissue were transferred into
24-well-plates, washed twice in PBS/0.1% Tween-20
(PBST-0.1), and then digested with proteinase K (stock
concentration: Roche [Mannheim, Germany] PCR
Grade, 0.3 lg/ml in 0.1 M Tris, pH 8, and 0.05 M
EDTA; working solution: 0.7 ll/ml) for 9 minutes at
room temperature. After washing twice with glycine in
PBST-0.1 (2 mg/ml), tissue was refixed in 4% PFA for
20 minutes. After washing 4X in PBST-0.1, supernatant
was removed and sections were washed once in 300
ll hybridization buffer (5 ml formamide, 2.5 ml 20X
SSC, 10 ll Tween, 100 ll yeast tRNA [100 mg/ml],
2.38 ml DEPC-H2O, 10 ll heparin [50 mg/ml]). After
replacing this with fresh hybridization buffer (500 ll/
well), the plate was wrapped with parafilm and kept
at 55C for at least 3 hours. Digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled
probes (1:1,000 to 1:500 in hybridization buffer) were
incubated at 80C for 10 minutes, briefly centrifuged,
and chilled on ice for 2 minutes. Hybridization buffer
in the wells was replaced by probe solution. Plates
were wrapped with parafilm and incubated at 55C
overnight. The following incubations were at 55C. The
solutions were preheated. Sections were washed twice
in 50% formamide/2X SSC þ 0.1% Tween-20 for 30
minutes each, once in 1X SSC þ 0.1% Tween-20 for
15 minutes, and twice in 0.2X SSC þ 0.1% Tween-20
for 30 minutes each.
Then the sections were blocked in 10% Boehringer/
Roche blocking reagent (10 g blocking reagent in 100 ml
PBST-0.1) at RT. Anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-coupled
fab fragments (Boehringer/Roche) were diluted 1:2,000
in blocking reagent, added to the sections, and left over-
night at 4C. Sections were washed 6 times for 20
minutes each in PBST-0.1 on a shaker and then once in
PBS. Staining solution was prepared by adding one NBT/
BCIP tablet (Sigma) in 10 ml twice distilled water. After
washing once in staining solution, sections were
incubated in fresh staining solution for 30 minutes to
overnight, depending on the kinetics of signal develop-
ment. Finally, sections were washed several times in PBS
and mounted in 70% glycerol.
Retrograde axonal tracing combined with
immunohistochemistry
Retrograde tracing of brain neurons with rhodamine
dextran amine (RDA) or biocytin has been described
(Becker et al., 1997). Briefly, a piece of recrystalized RDA
or biocytin was applied to the completely transected spi-
nal cord and allowed to be transported overnight (biocy-
tin, detected with Cy-2-labeled streptavidin) or 6 days
(RDA). Animals were perfusion-fixed, and brains were dis-
sected and sectioned on a vibrating blade microtome and
processed for immunohistochemistry as described above.
The RDA and antibody signals were then detected by fluo-
rescence microscopy.

Test of swimming capability
As previously described, we tested the swimming capa-
bility of lesioned fish by determining the time they were
able to hold their position in a water current (Reimer
et al., 2009). In a tunnel with a flat bottom (7-cm width),
15-cm-long compartments were divided off by wire mesh.
A current of 7 cm/s was induced by using a pond pump
(Nautilus 8000, Oase, Hörstel, Germany). The time that
fish were able to hold their position in the water current
was recorded. When a fish was swept against the wire
mesh and was unable to leave it again within 30 seconds,
the experiment was stopped. Recovery was assumed af-
ter 1 hour of sustained swimming.
Axon and cell quantification
Counts of terminal varicosities
We observed TH1 and 5-HT immunoreactivity mainly in
varicosities (Fig. 1G, 5B), which is typical of serotonergic
and dopaminergic terminals (Leger et al., 2001; Mrini
et al., 1995; Takeoka et al., 2009). Our manual and
semiautomatic quantification method counts mostly
profiles of varicosities. Occasionally, a fiber was too
thick or too densely populated by varicosities to resolve
these. Together with rare fibers of passage, these were
then counted as single entities. Because the size and
appearance of varicosities and axons was comparable
between lesioned and unlesioned spinal cords, these
quantifications give a good representation of changes in
TH1þ and 5-HTþ innervation, which may be most rele-
vant for a correlation with recovery of function. This
method does not determine how many of the originally
lesioned axons contribute to re-innervation of the spinal
cord or increased density of varicosities in the rostral
spinal cord.
We used a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a
20 Apochromate 0.75 lens for acquiring images of
whole spinal cross sections. To decrease background and
increase edge and shape detection of the thin circuitous
axonal structures, including varicosities, we used the Fea-
ture J Hessian plug-in for Image J (smallest eigenvalue
Hessian tensor; smoothing scale to 1.0; http://rsbweb.-
nih.gov/ij/plugins/index.html) on maximum projection z-
stacks (15 optical sections, thickness 1.5 lm) of whole
spinal sections (50 lm in thickness) according to an
established protocol (Grider et al., 2006). Upon conver-
sion to binary images (threshold 140), mostly varicosities
remain as particles and are quantified by using the ‘‘ana-
lyse particle’’ function of Image J with particle size 1 to in-
finity and circularity from 0.00 to 1.00. Comparing this
method with manual counts showed a good correspon-
dence. Images that contained fewer than approximately
100 varicosities were manually counted.
Cell quantification
Numbers of serotonergic cells were determined from
stereological counts of confocal images of the three ran-
domly selected 50-lm-thick Vibratome sections from the
region up to 750 lm rostral to the lesion site and three
sections 750 lm caudal to the lesion site. Numbers were
calculated separately rostral and caudal to the lesion site
and then summed for cell numbers in the entire 1.5 mm
surrounding the lesion site.
Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, the program Prism (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA) was used. Variability of values is
given as SEM. Statistical significance was determined by
using the Mann-Whitney U test for single comparisons or
ANOVA followed by Dunnet’s or Tukey’s post test for multi-
ple comparisons. Of note, numbers of cells and varicosity
profiles in unlesioned animals did not show systematic
changes over the period regeneration was analyzed in
lesioned animals (up to 13 weeks of animals that were 5–10
month of age). Therefore, unlesioned controls were pooled.
Brightness and contrast of photomicrographs were
adjusted and figure plates prepared by using Adobe Pho-
toshop CS3 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).
RESULTS
The aim of this study was to quantify the plastic changes
in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems during success-
ful spinal cord regeneration in an adult vertebrate.
Spinal dopamine is derived from the brain
To localize dopamine signals in the adult spinal cord,
we analyzed the expression of TH1 and TH2, the rate-lim-
iting enzymes for dopamine synthesis. Immunohisto-
chemistry with a TH1-specific antibody (Chen et al.,
2009) at a midthoracic level (3.5 mm caudal to the
brainstem/spinal cord transition) and at the level of the
dorsal fin (7 mm caudal to the brainstem/spinal cord
transition) in unlesioned fish revealed circuitous axons
with numerous varicosities, many of which were double-
labeled with the synaptic marker synaptophysin (Fig. 1A–
F,G–I). No TH1þ cell bodies were found in the spinal cord
(Fig. 1A–C). Double immunohistochemistry with the dopa-
mine antibody revealed that more than 80% of the TH1þ
varicosities were dopaminergic, indicating that TH1þ ter-
minals in the spinal cord are mainly dopaminergic (Fig.
1A–F,M). The remaining TH1þ profiles could be noradren-
ergic terminals, possibly originating from the locus coeru-
leus, as previously described at early developmental
stages (Kastenhuber et al., 2010; McLean and Fetcho,
2004). In the regenerated spinal cord, caudal to the
lesion site, a similar ratio of dopamine-positive TH1þ vari-
cosities was observed, indicating that TH1 was a good

marker for dopaminergic terminals also in the regener-
ated spinal cord (Fig. 1J–L,M).
To detect th2-expressing cell bodies in the CNS, we
had to resort to in situ hybridization, because antibodies
reacting with TH2 were not available. This indicated
the absence of TH2-expressing cells in the spinal cord
(Fig. 1N). However, labeled cell bodies were found in a
brain nucleus with spinal projections, the posterior

A–F: Double labeling of TH1 and dopamine in spinal cross sections at a mid-thoracic level reveals overlap (arrows in D–F). An axon termi-

indicated. G–I: TH1þ varicosities are co-labeled with synaptophysin (syp; arrows) immunoreactivity. J–L: Most regenerated TH1þ axon ter-
minals in the spinal cord are dopaminergic at 6 weeks post lesion (arrows; a terminal that is only labeled by the TH1 antibody is indicated
by an arrowhead). M: Quantification of TH1þ varicosity profiles double-labeled with a dopamine antibody (DAþ) in the unlesioned situation
and at 6 weeks post lesion indicates comparable ratios of TH1þ varicosities that are also dopamine positive. N,O: No mRNA expression

1997). In agreement with a minor contribution of TH2þ
axons to the dopaminergic innervation of the spinal cord,
10.4 6 3.19% (n ¼ 2 animals) of spinal terminal varicos-
ities that were labeled by a dopamine antibody were TH1.
To localize the source of TH1þ axons in the brain, we
retrogradely traced the descending projection from a
midthoracic level in combination with TH1 immunohisto-
chemistry (Fig. 1P–U). This showed double-labeled cells
in the dopaminergic periventricular nucleus of the poste-
rior tuberculum in the diencephalon only, similar to what
has been reported for the embryonic spinal cord (Kasten-
huber et al., 2010; McLean and Fetcho, 2004). Overall,
this suggests that the major sources of dopamine in the
spinal cord are TH1þ axons coming from the brain and
that TH1þ terminals are mostly dopaminergic. No spinal
intrinsic cellular source of dopamine was detectable.
Lesion-induced quantitative changes in
TH11 terminal varicosities in the spinal cord
We examined the time course of changes in numbers of
TH1þ varicosity profiles ‘‘rostral’’ (within 750 lm), ‘‘caudal’’
(within 750 lm), and ‘‘far caudal’’ (3,500 lm) to the posi-
tion of a midthoracic lesion site (Fig. 2A) at 1, 2, 6, and 13
wpl. We chose these time points because severed axons in
the caudal spinal cord have undergone Wallerian degener-
ation at 1 wpl, axon re-growth beyond the lesion site starts
at around 2 wpl, and functional recovery plateaus at 6 wpl
(Becker et al., 2004). We chose the 13 wpl time point to
detect any late changes in innervation. For the late time
points (6 and 13 wpl), when recovery can be assessed, val-
ues are only given for animals that showed recovery in a
forced swim test, if not stated otherwise.
Rostral to the lesion site, from 2 weeks onward, num-
bers of TH1þ varicosity profiles continuously and signifi-
cantly increased to at least 13 wpl (2 wpl: 952.6 6 85.82
profiles/section, n ¼ 6; 6 wpl: 1,204.6 6 145.36, n ¼ 6;
13 wpl: 1,571.9 6 368.55, n ¼ 5), the last time point
examined, to levels that were 2.3-fold increased over those
in unlesioned fish. This time course is consistent with initial
die-back and later sprouting of axons (Fig. 2B–E).
Caudal to the lesion site, almost no varicosities were
observed at 1 wpl (0.9 6 0.61 profiles/section, n ¼ 5),
consistent with a supraspinal origin of these terminals and
their subsequent Wallerian degeneration (Fig. 2F). Some
varicosity profiles were visible at 2 wpl (24.8 6 10.32 pro-
files/section, n ¼ 6). At 6 wpl, a significant increase in the
number of varicosity profiles (296.3 6 80.57 profiles/sec-
tion, n ¼ 6; P < 0.01; Fig. 2G,I) was observed, compared
with 1 wpl. This indicated re-growth and termination of
TH1þ axons beyond the lesion site. At 13 wpl, 149.3 6
124.35 profiles/section (n ¼ 4; Fig. 2H,I) were observed.
Thus, immediately caudal to the lesion site, the number of
TH1þ varicosity profiles was restored to maximally 44% of
that in unlesioned animals at 6 wpl.
Far caudal to the midthoracic position of the lesion
site, unlesioned animals showed substantial TH1þ inner-
vation (484.6 6 86.01 profiles/section, n ¼ 4). This had
disappeared by 1 wpl (1.7 6 1.65 profiles/section, n ¼
5; Fig. 2J,M). Surprisingly, no appreciable re-innervation
at this position was observed for up to 13 wpl (2 wpl: 2.8
6 2.45 profiles/section, n ¼ 3; 6 wpl: 3.36 3.33, n ¼ 6;
13 wpl: 6.5 6 2.77, n ¼ 4; Fig. 2K,L,M). This indicated
that regenerating TH1þ axons did not reach previously in-
nervated far caudal levels.
TH11 re-innervation correlates with recovery
of swimming capability
As previously reported, regenerative success in spinal-
lesioned fish is variable, and anatomical regeneration of
axons beyond the lesion site correlates with regenerative
success (Becker et al., 1997, 2004). We wanted to deter-
mine whether plastic changes of TH1þ axon terminals also
correlate with recovery of function. To assess recovery of
swimming capability, we used a previously established test
of forced swimming against a water flow at 6 wpl (Fig. 3A)
(Reimer et al., 2009). In a set of 37 fish, we found that 17
fish were unable to hold their position in the water flow for
more than 30 seconds. These fish were classified as nonre-
covered. Another 17 fish held their position for an hour, at
which time the test was terminated. These fish were classi-
fied as recovered. Unlesioned fish always sustained swim-
ming to 1 hour. Three individuals that showed intermediate
swim times (9, 13, and 50 minutes) were also classified as
recovered (Fig. 3B). A comparison of numbers of TH1þ vari-
cosity profiles rostral to the lesion site between recovered
and nonrecovered fish did not show differences at 6 wpl
(recovered: 1,204.66 145.36 profiles/section, n¼ 6; non-
recovered: 1,011.46 115.82, n¼ 6, P> 0.05; Fig. 4A–C).
In contrast, nonrecovered fish showed significantly
less re-innervation caudal to the lesion site compared
with recovered fish (recovered: 296.3 6 80.57 profiles/
section, n ¼ 6; nonrecovered: 39.7 6 32.31, n ¼ 6; P <
0.05; Fig. 4D–F). Thus quantitative differences in terminal
varicosities caudal to the lesion site, derived from TH1þ
axons that had grown beyond the lesion site, were corre-
lated with recovery of swimming capability.
Re-lesion abolishes functional recovery
and TH11 axon terminals caudal
to the lesion site
To determine whether recovery of swimming capability
and TH1þ innervation of the caudal spinal cord depend
on continuity of the spinal cord, we re-lesioned the spinal
cord in the same position in three recovered animals that

held their position in the water flow for 60 minutes. All
three animals completely lost their swimming capability
(Fig. 3C), and TH1þ varicosities were almost completely
absent caudal to the lesion site (0.4 6 0.43 profiles/sec-
tion, n ¼ 3) 1 week after re-lesion. This indicated that
functional recovery was unlikely to be due to plasticity of
the spinal circuitry caudal to the lesion site alone and
that TH1þ re-innervation of the caudal spinal cord after a
lesion was most likely derived from descending axons
that regenerated beyond the lesion site.
Lesion-induced quantitative changes in 5-HT
terminals in the spinal cord
By using a 5-HT antibody, we detected circuitous axons
with numerous varicosities, which were thereby identified

as axon terminals, in the spinal cord at a midthoracic level
(Fig. 5A), and at the level of the dorsal fin (Fig. 6I). Cell
bodies were also present in the spinal cord (Fig. 5A).
Many of the terminal varicosities were double-labeled
with the synaptic marker SV2 (Fig. 5B–D). By using retro-
grade tracing from a midthoracic level in combination
with 5-HT immunohistochemistry we found double-la-
beled cells in the inferior raphe region of the brainstem

(Fig. 5E–H), but not in the superior raphe, confirming a
previous report of 5-HTþ neurons with descending axons
in the inferior raphe in adult zebrafish (Lillesaar et al.,
2009). Thus 5-HTþ terminals in the spinal cord are of
supraspinal and local origin.
We established a time course for changes in the den-
sity of 5-HTþ terminal varicosities after a spinal lesion in
the same animals used for TH1 immunohistochemistry,
assessing the same locations and time points. In unle-
sioned animals, 679.1 6 126.32 profiles/section (n ¼ 7)
were present. Rostral to the lesion site the number of
varicosity profiles was 505.8 6 36.95 (n ¼ 5) at 1wpl.
Thereafter, numbers of varicosity profiles increased until
they were 80% higher than in unlesioned animals at 6 wpl
(2 wpl: 989.8 6 155.38, n ¼ 6; 6 wpl: 1,224.1 6 105.04
profiles/section, n ¼ 6; P < 0.05). At 13 wpl, 1,048.2 6
247.04 profiles/section (n ¼ 4) were observed (Fig. 6A–
D). This suggested considerable sprouting of 5-HTþ axons
rostral to the lesion site.
Caudal to the lesion site, the number of varicosity pro-
files was strongly and significantly reduced at 1 wpl (35.0
6 5.62 profiles/section, n ¼ 5; P < 0.001) compared
with unlesioned control animals. As opposed to TH1þ
varicosities, some of the 5-HTþ varicosities remained at 1
wpl, suggesting that these originated from local 5-HTþ
neurons, whereas descending axons and their terminals
had undergone Wallerian degeneration at this time point.
The numbers of varicosity profiles significantly increased
thereafter and peaked at 6 wpl (2 wpl: 103.0 6 17.41
profiles/section, n ¼ 6; 6 wpl: 383.7 6 71.91, n ¼ 6).
The increase in numbers of varicosity profiles between 1
wpl and 6 wpl was statistically significant (P < 0.05). At
13 wpl (132.16 19.42 profiles/section, n ¼ 3), there
was no further increase, compared with 6 wpl (Fig. 6E–
H). Thus numbers of varicosity profiles gradually
increased again caudal to a lesion site to maximally 58%
of the number in unlesioned animals at 6 wpl.
Far caudal to the lesion site, we also observed a huge
reduction in numbers of varicosity profiles at 1 wpl (unle-
sioned: 659.9 6 110.05 profiles/section, n ¼ 3; 1 wpl:
32.5 6 7.86, n ¼ 5, P < 0.001). Numbers of varicosity
profiles did not increase until 13 wpl, the latest time point
analyzed (2 wpl: 67.8 6 5.31 profiles/section, n ¼ 3; 6
wpl: 91.3 6 14.23, n ¼ 6; 13 wpl: 64.2 6 17.85, n ¼ 3;
Fig. 6I–L). This suggested that regenerating descending
5-HTþ axons did not reach the far caudal level.
The number of 5-HT1 varicosity profiles
caudal to the lesion site correlates with
recovery of swimming capability
Rostral to the lesion site there was no significant differ-
ence between recovered (1,224.1 6 105.04 profiles/
section, n ¼ 6) and nonrecovered fish (966.8 6 70.95
profiles/section, n ¼ 6, P > 0.05) in the number of 5-HTþ
varicosity profiles at 6 wpl (Fig. 7A–C). In contrast, caudal
to the lesion site recovered fish (383.7 6 71.91 profiles/
section, n ¼ 6) had significantly more varicosity profiles
than nonrecovered ones (88.0 6 24.12 profiles/section,
n ¼ 6; P < 0.01; Fig. 7D,E,G). This suggested that the
quantity of terminal varicosities caudal to the lesion site,
derived from re-growth of 5-HTþ axons beyond the spinal
lesion, was associated with recovery of swimming
capability.

The contribution of endogenous spinal
neurons to spinal innervation increases after
a lesion
By comparing numbers of varicosity profiles at 1 wpl
(35 profiles/section) with the unlesioned situation
(679 profiles/section), we estimated that local 5-HT cells
make a minor contribution (5%) to spinal 5-HT innerva-
tion in unlesioned animals. After re-lesion at 6 wpl and
analysis at 1 week after re-lesion, 122.16 32.95 profiles/
section (n ¼ 3) were observed (Fig. 7F,G). This was a sub-
stantial reduction compared with 384 profiles/section
observed at 6 wpl, indicating loss of descending axons that
had regenerated over the lesion site. Importantly, this also
demonstrated a 3.5-fold increase in the number of spinal-
derived 5-HTþ varicosity profiles after regeneration (1 wpl
vs. 1 week after re-lesion: P < 0.036). Increased innerva-
tion by spinal 5-HTþ neurons is probably a consequence of
lesion-induced generation of 5-HTþ neurons, as observed
in goldfish (Takeda et al., 2008).
Lesion-induced generation of 5-HT1 cells
Numbers of 5-HTþ cells did not differ significantly
between the rostral and caudal level at the different time
points and are therefore presented together. Absolute
numbers of 5-HTþ cells increased steadily after a lesion
up to 6 wpl (unlesioned: 93.1 6 14.17 cells/1,500 lm
spinal cord, n ¼ 18; 1 wpl: 120.0 6 41.13, n ¼ 5; 2 wpl:
363.4 6 30.41, n ¼ 19; 6 wpl: 471.2 6 80.57, n ¼ 10;
Fig. 8A–C) when the number of 5-HTþ cells was 5.1-fold
higher than in unlesioned animals (P < 0.001). At 13 wpl
(217.8 6 16.70 cells, n ¼ 5), a significant reduction in
cell number was observed compared with 6 wpl (P <
0.05). This number was again comparable to that in unle-
sioned animals. Far caudal to the lesion site, cell numbers

This section serves as comparison for B, C, E–G. B–D: Numbers of 5-HTþ varicosity profiles increase continuously rostral to the lesion site
and plateau at 6 weeks post lesion. E–H: Caudal to the lesion site, most varicosities are lost and significant re-innervation is observed at
6 weeks post lesion. I–L: Numbers of varicosity profiles remain low at a level 3.5 mm caudal to the lesion site for at least 13 weeks post
lesion. ***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; *, P < 0.05. Scale bar ¼ 25 lm in K (applies to A–C, E–G, I–K).

remained unchanged (unlesioned: 200 6 22.21 cells/
1,500 lm, n ¼ 3; 1 wpl: 137 6 30.95, n ¼ 5; 2 wpl:
163.6 6 29.30, n ¼ 3; 6 wpl: 229.6 6 35.68, n ¼ 6; 13
wpl: 100.06 34.55), in agreement with previous observa-
tions that proliferation in the ventricular progenitor zone
is much lower at distant levels (Reimer et al., 2008). Over-
all, this suggests an overproduction of 5-HTþ cells close
to the lesion site that is later pruned back.
To directly show that 5-HTþ neurons were newly gener-
ated after the lesion, we injected animals with the prolif-
eration marker BrdU at 0, 2, and 6 days post lesion. This
labeled 74.86 21.10 5-HTþ/BrdUþ cells (n ¼ 8) at 2 wpl
and 209.8 6 26.93 cells (n ¼ 8) at 6 wpl. No cells were
double-labeled in unlesioned fish (n ¼3; Fig. 8D–I). Even
though we presumed that those 5-HTþ cells in lesioned
animals that exceeded the number in unlesioned fish
were newly generated, not all of them were double
labeled with BrdU. This was expected, because our BrdU
injection scheme also labels only 25% of newly gener-
ated motor neurons after a lesion (Reimer et al., 2008).
We noticed that 5-HTþ cells contacted the central
canal only in the lesioned spinal cord at 6 and 13 wpl,
suggesting that these were recently generated at the cen-
tral canal. The central canal is lined with the spinal pro-
genitor cells, which are subdivided into dorsoventral
expression domains of transcription factors that are simi-
lar to those that give rise to different cell types during em-
bryonic development (Reimer et al., 2008). We found that
5-HTþ cells contacting the central canal were not ran-
domly distributed. By double-labeling of 5-HT in olig2:GFP
transgenic fish, we found that all 5-HTþ cells at the cen-
tral canal contacted it either ventral to the olig2:GFPþ
zone (n ¼ 12 cells; Fig. 9D–F) or in the olig2:GFPþ zone
itself (n ¼ 5 cells). In shh:GFP transgenic animals, two 5-
HTþ cells were observed in close proximity to shh:GFPþ
ependymo-radial glial cells, and five cells appeared to be
intermingled with these cells, but were always shh:GFP
negative (Fig. 9A–C). However, 5-HT was never co-labeled
with olig2:GFP or shh:GFP. This distribution of central
canal-contacting 5-HT neurons is consistent with a ven-
tral progenitor zone for 5-HTþ neurons after a lesion,
comprising the olig2:GFPþ zone and a more ventral zone.
Blocking hedgehog activity reduces the
number of 5-HT1 neurons
The ventral origin of 5-HT neurons after lesion suggests
an involvement of hedghog signaling derived from ventral
ependymo-radial glial cells. This has been shown to pro-
mote regeneration of motor neurons after a spinal lesion
(Reimer et al., 2009). To test this, we used intraperitoneal
injections of the Smoothened antagonist cyclopamine,

cantly fewer 5-HTþ varicosity profiles are present caudal to the spinal transection site in non recovered fish (E,G) than in those showing
recovery of swimming capability (D). Re-lesion of recovered fish significantly reduces the number of varicosity profiles caudal to the lesion
site, indicating that these are mainly derived from descending axons (F,G). **, P < 0.01. Scale bar ¼ 25 lm in F (applies to A,B,D–F).

previously shown to reduce motor neuron generation and
expression of the hedgehog target gene patched1 in
motor neuron progenitor cells (Reimer et al., 2009). Anal-
ysis took place at 6 wpl, when the number of newly gener-
ated 5-HTþ neurons peaked.
Numbers of 5-HTþ cells after cyclopmine treatment
were significantly reduced by 23% compared with fish
injected with the control substance tomatidine (tomatidine:
10.8 6 0.86 cell profiles/50 lm, n ¼ 8; cyclopamine: 8.3
6 1.00 cell profiles/50 lm; Mann-Whitney U test, one-
tailed, P¼ 0.0406). This suggests that shh promotes gener-
ation of 5-HTþ cells in the lesioned spinal cord.
Numbers of newly generated 5-HT1 neurons
caudal to the lesion site correlate with
recovery of swimming capability and axon
re-growth
To determine whether numbers of 5-HTþ cells correlate
with recovery of swimming capability, we compared num-
bers of 5-HTþ cells between recovered and nonrecovered
fish at 6 wpl, when cell numbers peak and regenerative suc-
cess can be assessed. Rostral to the lesion site, differences
in 5-HTþ cell numbers were not significant between recov-
ered (365.0 6 73.59 cells/750 lm, n ¼ 6) and nonrecov-
ered fish (292.6 6 63.14 cells/750 lm, n ¼ 6; P > 0.05;
Fig. 10A–C). In contrast, caudal to the lesion site, fewer 5-
HTþ cells were present in nonrecovered (111.1 6 18.59
cells/750 lm) vs. recovered fish (253.7 6 28.32; P ¼
0.0198; Fig. 10D–F), suggesting some interaction between
re-growing axons and newly generated 5-HTþ cells.
DISCUSSION
We show for the first time that the TH1 and 5-HT sys-
tems are substantially altered in spinal-lesioned zebrafish
concomitant with recovery of swimming function (sum-
marized in Fig. 11). Descending axons sprout rostral to
the lesion site and regenerate beyond the lesion site for
only a short distance, re-establishing about half of the

previous density of terminals. Far caudal positions are
not re-innervated. Despite this relatively weak regenera-
tive growth, re-innervation derived from regenerated
axons caudal to the lesion site strictly correlates with
recovery of function. Spinal-intrinsic 5-HTþ neurons are
first overproduced in the ventral spinal cord in a hedge-
hog-dependent manner and later pruned back to numbers
that are comparable to those in unlesioned animals.
For both TH1þ and 5-HTþ descending systems, the
abundance of terminals caudal to the lesion site,
re-established through axon re-growth beyond the lesion
site, is associated with functional recovery. Importantly,
re-lesioning recovered fish abolishes TH1þ and 5-HTþ ter-
minals from descending axons caudal to the lesion site, as
well as recovered swimming function. This is in agreement
with earlier studies showing that fish in which axon re-
growth is sparse or experimentally reduced fail to recover
(Becker et al., 1997, 2004). Although this suggests that re-
innervation of the caudal spinal cord by re-grown TH1þ
and 5-HTþ axons may be important for recovery of the fish,
prelesion patterns are not restored. Both monoaminergic
systems studied here re-establish only about half of the
terminal varicosities previously observed directly caudal to
the lesion site. Moreover, more caudal levels of the spinal
cord are mostly not re-innervated.
A previous study also reported re-growth of descending
TH1þ and 5-HTþ axons in spinal-lesioned zebrafish (van
Raamsdonk et al., 1998). However, these limitations
were not noticed, due to a lack of quantitative analyses.
That study found axon re-growth to 6 mm caudal to the
lesion site. We also find terminals derived from long-dis-
tance re-growth, which was, however, exceptional, as it
was observed in only one of six recovered fish. Even
though the functional impact of TH1þ and 5-HTþ on spi-
nal function is well documented (see Introduction), TH1þ
and 5-HTþ axons are only a minority of the axons that do
regenerate, and many of these other axons carrying other
neuroactive substances reach far caudal levels (Becker
et al., 1997), which might have been sufficient to support
the observed degree of functional recovery.
What are the reasons for limited re-growth and re-
innervation by TH1þ and 5-HTþ descending axons? Extrin-
sic factors, such as a glial scar (Busch and Silver, 2007)
or myelin inhibitors (Schwab, 2004) as in mammals are
unlikely reasons, because no evidence has been found for
either of these in fish (Abdesselem et al., 2009; Becker
and Becker, 2002; Nona and Stafford, 1995). Moreover,
up to half of the original terminal density is re-established
for TH1þ and 5-HTþ directly caudal to the transection
site, suggesting at least some axon re-growth beyond the
lesion site. In addition, many other brain nuclei regener-
ate axons even into the distal spinal cord (Becker et al.,
1997). It is more likely that the axotomy was too distal
from the neuronal somata of TH1þ and 5-HTþ neurons to
elicit a robust regenerative response in descending TH1þ
and 5-HTþ axons. Indeed, some brain nuclei show a
regenerative response, including upregulation of growth-
related genes, only when axotomy occurred close to the
soma, i.e., after a more rostral spinal lesion (Becker et al.,
1998). This is similar to mammalian neurons (Doster
et al., 1991; Tetzlaff et al., 1994).
In support of this explanation, we have found robust re-
innervation by TH1þ and 5-HTþ axons 3.5 mm into the
spinal cord in one fish that was lesioned at the brain-
stem/spinal cord junction (data not shown). Interestingly,
Figure 9. 5-HTþ cells that contact the central canal in a ventral
position are found in the lesioned spinal cord. Cross sections of
the ventral ventricular zone at 3 months post lesion are shown;
dorsal is up. Ventricular position is depicted in phase-contrast
images underlying double labeling in C and F. A–C: Central canal-
contacting 5-HTþ cells are located close to shh:GFPþ ependymo-

5-HTþ axons have superior sprouting and regenerative
capacity compared with other axon types in mammals,
demonstrated by their ability to penetrate a glial scar
after injury (Hawthorne et al., 2011). Thus, in our lesion
model TH1þ and 5-HTþ cells might not have mounted a
significant regenerative response after a lesion at the
relatively distal midthoracic level.
Our observations open up the opportunity to learn how
successful recovery of function can be achieved with lim-
ited anatomical regeneration of specific systems. Appa-
rently, re-innervation of far caudal spinal segments by
TH1þ and 5-HTþ descending axons is not necessary for
recovery of substantial swimming function. It is possible
that the significantly sprouted TH1þ and 5-HTþ axons ros-
tral to the lesion site, as well as those axons that did
regenerate into the caudal cord, are capable of modulat-
ing the propagating rostrocaudal wave of excitation in the
spinal network during swimming (Grillner and Wallen,
2007) without the need to do this at every level of the spi-
nal cord. Alternatively, deficits in function that may be
associated with altered TH1þ and 5-HTþ innervation of
the spinal cord might not have been revealed by the func-
tional test of swimming endurance applied here.
Another way in which a lack of long-distance TH1þ and
5-HTþ descending axons could be compensated for is
plasticity of the intraspinal circuitry caudal to the lesion
site. For example, spinal intrinsic neurons, which are
located at some distance caudal to a lesion site and have
not been axotomized by the lesion, upregulate expression
of the growth-associated protein 43 and the cell
Figure 10. Numbers of 5-HTþ cells caudal to the lesion site correlate with recovery of swimming function at 6 weeks post lesion.

recognition molecule L1.1 after a spinal lesion (Becker
et al., 2005). Both of these molecules are indicators of
neuronal plasticity (Benowitz and Routtenberg, 1997;
Emery et al., 2003; Kapfhammer, 1997). Similarly, the rat
motor cortex shows plastic changes after ablation of
dopaminergic input (Viaro et al., 2011).
Could the loss of innervation by descending 5-HTþ
axons be offset by newly generated spinal 5-HTþ neurons
or axonal sprouting of local 5-HTþ neurons? Indeed, there
is massive generation of 5-HT cells in the ventral spinal
cord, far exceeding the number of cells in unlesioned ani-
mals. However, this increase occurs only in the vicinity of
the spinal lesion site, and cell numbers are later pruned
back to a level that is no longer significantly elevated over
that in unlesioned animals. Sprouting of 5-HTþ spinal
neurons in the caudal spinal cord that is denervated of
descending 5-HTþ input could also compensate for a lack
of descending input. However, far caudal to the lesion
site (not reached by regenerating descending axons), the
density of terminal varicosities never significantly
increased, despite prolonged (13 weeks) depletion of
5-HTþ axons. Thus neither neurogenesis nor axonal

sprouting of spinal-intrinsic 5-HTþ cells compensate for
lost descending 5-HTþ innervation.
Adult zebrafish regenerate spinal 5-HTþ neurons in a
hedgehog-dependent manner. Our analysis has shown
that only during regeneration do radially elongated 5-HT
neurons contact the ventricle in adult animals. This is sim-
ilar to newly generated motor neurons shown to have ven-
tricular contact during spinal cord regeneration (Reimer
et al., 2008). Given that lesion-induced proliferation of
progenitor cells occurs at the ventricle, this provided us
with the opportunity to estimate where 5-HTþ cells poten-
tially originate. In contrast to motor neurons, which are
born in a narrow olig2:GFPþ zone of ependymo-radial pro-
genitor cells, 5-HTþ cells appear to have a wider ventral
region of origin. Nevertheless, regeneration of this cell
type appears to be promoted by a ventral midline-derived
hedgehog signal, similar to motor neuron regeneration
(Reimer et al., 2009), as determined by blocking this sig-
nal with cyclopamine, a strong and specific antagonist of
the Hedgehog receptor Smoothened.
Interestingly, in developing mice the descending 5-HTþ
projection represses the expression of the 5-HT pheno-
type within a subpopulation of spinal neurons (Brancher-
eau et al., 2002). In our adult regenerating system,
descending 5-HTþ axons are unlikely to negatively influ-
ence neurogenesis of spinal 5-HTþ cells, because equal
numbers of 5-HTþ cells were observed rostral to the
lesion site (where descending 5-HTþ axons sprouted) and
caudal to it (where descending 5-HTþ axons were absent)
in recovered fish at 2 weeks post lesion. To the contrary,
descending axons could even convey a positive signal for
spinal neurogenesis, because in animals with few
descending axons growing over the lesion site (nonrecov-
ered), also fewer 5-HTþ cells were present caudal, but
not rostral to the lesion site.
It is important to note that generation of 5-HTþ neu-
rons (this report) and motor neurons (Reimer et al.,
2008), as well as robust hedgehog signaling, is only de-
tectable in the lesioned spinal cord (Reimer et al., 2009).
This is different from neurogenic zones in the brain of
zebrafish (Adolf et al., 2006; Kaslin et al., 2009) and
mammals (reviewed, for example, in Gould, 2007) that
are constitutively active. In the unlesioned spinal cord of
zebrafish and mammals, progenitor cells are quiescent
(Meletis et al., 2008). However, the lesioned adult spinal
cord of zebrafish regenerates different neuronal cell types
in a hedgehog-dependent manner, whereas in the mam-
malian spinal cord only glial cells are generated (Meletis
et al., 2008). Therefore, finding the switch that allows pro-
liferation and neurogenesis in the lesioned spinal cord of
adult zebrafish is a future goal.
Some changes in the TH1þ and 5-HTþ systems
occurred at late stages of regeneration, between 6 and
13 weeks post lesion, i.e., after functional recovery had
been achieved. Most remarkable is the significant reduc-
tion in the number of 5-HTþ neurons. This could be due to
limited trophic support of these cells or to feedback from a
rearranged spinal circuitry. Although in the closely related
goldfish, a constant increase in the number 5-HT neurons
after a spinal lesion was also noted, no reduction was seen
at later stages (Takeda et al., 2008). It is possible that this
phenomenon only occurs after the last time point analyzed
in goldfish. Interestingly, numbers of terminal TH1þ and 5-
HTþ varicosity profiles, derived from descending axons
regenerated beyond the lesion site, also appeared to be
slightly reduced again at 13 wpl compared with 6 wpl,
whereas the sprouted terminals rostral to the lesion site
remained. This finding supports the notion that consider-
able plasticity is occurring in the caudal lesioned spinal
cord even after recovery of swimming function.
Overall, our study supports the idea that the lesioned
spinal cord of adult zebrafish undergoes substantial axo-
nal and cellular plasticity after a lesion, which leads to
functional recovery. Significant alterations in TH1þ and 5-
HTþ systems, including a lack of re-innervation of distal
levels of the spinal cord, reveal that for successful spinal
cord regeneration, re-establishing the prelesion circuitry
is not a prerequisite. However, this and previous studies
highlight the importance of axon re-growth over the lesion
site for recovery to occur.
