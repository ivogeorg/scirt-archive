Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) have been investigated extensively as a therapy to promote repair in the
injured CNS, with variable efficacy in numerous studies over the previous decade. In many studies that report
anatomical and functional recovery, the beneficial effects have been attributed to the ability of OECs to cross the
PNS–CNSboundary, their production of growth factors, cell adhesionmolecules and extracellularmatrix proteins
that promote and guide axon growth, and their ability to remyelinate axons. In this brief review, we focus on the
d astrocytes in vivo and in vitro, in the context of how OECsmay be overcoming the

neurons have a close relationship with an equally
unique glial cell: the olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC).
athing cells bear characteristics of astrocytes and
nd ensheath olfactory axons for their full length from
the olfactory bulb (Chuah andWest, 2002; Doucette,
1990). Unlike Schwann cells which originate from neural crest cells,
precursors of OECs reside in the olfactory epithelium and migrate
with, and ahead of olfactory axons, as they grow towards the bulb
during development (Chuah and Au, 1991; Tennent and Chuah,
1996). Due to the substantial evidence that OECs provide trophic
support for olfactory neuron regeneration (Kafitz and Greer, 1999;
Lipson et al., 2003; Woodhall et al., 2001), their possible path-finding
role and their relative accessibility in humans, OECs have been
proposed as candidate cells for autologous implantation into spinal
cord lesions and other CNS injuries (Barnett and Chang, 2004;
Mackay-Sim et al., 2008).
Many studies that utilize OECs as a therapeutic agent for repair in
the CNS have focussed on their capacity to induce regeneration of the
injured axons (Bartolomei and Greer, 2000; Deumens et al., 2006;
Guntinas-Lichius et al., 2001). This brief review gives an appraisal of
OECs as a cell-based transplantation therapy by presenting data in the
context of interactions between OECs, other glial cells and fibroblasts.
The possible influence of OECs on inflammation is also discussed in
light of recent findings that OECs have the potential to produce
cytokines and display innate immune properties and thus modify the
characteristics of the constituent cells of the glial scar.
Olfactory ensheathing cells and glial scar components in
experimentally induced models of spinal injury
The primary objective of studies utilizing OEC transplants was to
establish whether OECs are able to induce regrowth of injured axons.
Therefore, considerably less attention has been paid to the interaction
between OECs and cells involved in glial scarring. Olfactory ensheath-
ing cells have been transplanted into several spinal cord injurymodels
with variable degrees of success (Li et al., 1998; other references in
Table 1). These discrepancies could be due to a number of reasons, e.g.
the source andmethod of purification of OECs, different injury models
leading to different temporal sequences of glial scarring and
inflammation and the time of transplantation (acute vs. chronic).
The studies listed in Table 1 are by no means comprehensive but they
demonstrate various spinal cord related injury models and the
variability in functional and anatomical outcomes consequent to the
use of OEC transplants in different laboratories. A more comprehen-
sive survey of different lesion models and their outcomes is reviewed
elsewhere (Richter and Roskams, 2008).
Electrolytic lesion
Electrolytic lesions induced by passing direct current for several
minutes into tissues, are small, circumscribed lesions that can be
precisely performed on specific tracts, such as the corticospinal tract
in the spinal cord (Li and Raisman, 1995). Severance of the tract
results in massive cell death of oligodendrocytes in the first few days
(Li et al., 1999), followed by progressive hypertrophy of longitudinal
astrocytic processes from 1 to 13 weeks after the lesion. By the end of
this period, axonal sprouts from the severed tract have ramified
within a macrophage-filled central area of lesion, surrounded by a
dense astrocytic scar. In addition, Schwann cells were reported to
migrate into the lesion and myelinate some of the severed axons (Li
and Raisman, 1995). Using this injury paradigm, Li and co-workers
transplanted semi-purified OECs isolated from adult rat olfactory
bulbs into the lesion site (Li et al., 1997, 1998). Based on positive

fibronectin and L1, it was reported that the OECs aggregated in the
central area of the lesion surrounded by astrocytic processes which
only slightly upregulated their GFAP expression. Furthermore, sprouts
from the severed tracts traversed the transplant and continued in the
spinal cord caudal to the lesion. Using the same injurymodel, a similar
histological finding, accompanied by recovery of directed forepaw
retrieval, was obtained when OEC transplants were placed precisely
into the central lesion cavity 8 weeks after electrolytic damage of the
corticospinal tract (Keyvan-Fouladi et al., 2003). Functional recovery
was absent if the OEC transplant was misplaced a few hundred
microns dorsal to the lesion cavity, suggesting that interaction
between OECs and hypertrophic astrocyte processes was a prerequi-
site for functional recovery.
Photochemical lesion
A photochemical lesion of the spinal cord is induced by injecting a
photosensitizing organic dye, e.g. Rose Bengal, and then irradiating
with light at a specific wavelength. Excitation of the dye induces free
radical production that leads to endothelial dysfunction, platelet
aggregation and ultimately vascular occlusion (Bunge et al., 1994;
Watson et al., 1986). The resultant oedema and tissue necrosis creates
a large lesion cavity, which by 5 days contains debris-laden macro-
phages (Bunge et al., 1994). The lesion cavity is markedly more
extensive than that induced by an electrolytic lesion and spans the
white and gray matter of the dorsal half of the spinal cord. The border
of the lesion cavity is marked by several layers of flattened astrocytes
coated with basal lamina and surrounded by collagen fibrils (Bunge et
al., 1994). By 2 weeks, meningeal cells and Schwann cells have
migrated into the cavity and some of them myelinate axons at the
injury site. Olfactory ensheathing cells transplanted into a photo-
chemical spinal cord lesion surrounded the lesion cavity, which was
significantly smaller with a larger area of preserved spinal cord than in
non-transplanted animals (Verdú et al., 2001, 2003). Immunostaining
showed that most of the astrocytes in the OEC-transplanted rats did
not hypertrophy, had short, thin processes and expressed lower levels
of proteoglycans. Although no neuroanatomical techniques were used
to demonstrate regeneration of axonal fibers in these studies, OEC-
transplanted rats showed better locomotor ability and had larger
amplitudes of motor- and somatosensory-evoked potentials (Verdú et
al., 2003).
Dorsal column and complete spinal transection
A common experimental model is physical sectioning of the spinal
cord, either to the dorsal column or a complete transection which
severs all ascending and descending tracts. Such a lesion induces
massive infiltration of fibroblasts and macrophages, reorganization
and hypertrophy of astrocytes into dense walls of cells and the
formation of cystic cavities (Lagord et al., 2002; Ramer et al., 2004a;
Silver andMiller, 2004). Table 1 provides examples of dorsal columnar
spinal transection models using acute or delayed transplantation of
OECs derived from the lamina propria or the olfactory bulb. Ramer et
al. (2004a) reported a reduction in cavity formation and transforma-
tion of the glial scar when OECs were transplanted following dorsal
column transection. The astrocytes realigned their processes to form a
diffuse glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive boundary and CSPG was
deposited diffusely along laminin-rich channels. This novel environ-
mentmay be crucial for promoting extensive sprouting of sensory and
motor axons into the lesion site (Ramer et al., 2004a). In comparison,
when OECs were transplanted into the injured dorsal column in
polyvinylidene fluoride capsules, cystic cavities persisted in many
animals although collateral growth from the intact ventral corticosp-
inal tract was observed (Chuah et al., 2004). The persistence of cystic
cavities was likely due to compression pressure resulting from thecapsule or the lack of direct cellular contact between OECs and spinal
cord tissue.
Although the study by Ramer et al. (2004a) suggested that glial
scar alteration could be crucial to axonal regrowth, studies by others
(López-Vales et al., 2007, 2006; Ramon-Cueto et al., 2000) cast doubt
on this view. In these studies, the rat spinal cord was completely
transected at the thoracic level and OECs were transplanted at the
time of lesion or post-lesionally by one week or 45 days. Following
recovery in both OEC-transplanted and non-transplanted spinal cords,
the spinal transection site wasmarked by a wide zone of tissue lacking
GFAP staining (Ramon-Cueto et al., 2000). This zonewas of meningeal
origin while the cut ends of the two spinal cord stumps showed
intense immunoreactivity for GFAP, both in the presence and absence
of OECs. When OECs were transplanted one week post-lesion, GFAP
and NG2 were downregulated in the perilesional cord segments,
while transplanting OECs 45 days after the injury did not reduce post-
traumatic astrogliosis as assessed by quantitative analysis of GFAP
immunoreactivity (López-Vales et al., 2007, 2006). Despite these
differing effects on astrogliosis, regrowth of corticospinal and
raphespinal axons was demonstrated for both transplant conditions.
Hence there are likely to be additional molecular signals regulated by
OECs that may directly or indirectly influence neural repair.
Contusion lesion
Contusion lesions are often induced experimentally by dropping a
blunt weight on to the spinal cord from different heights using devices
such as the MASCIS impactor (Gruner, 1992). The resulting compres-
sion results in the gradual destruction of tissues, ultimately leading to
the formation of a central fluid-filled cavity. The dura remains intact
and consequently few fibroblasts are found in the scar tissue that
forms around the injury (Oudega, 2007). When OECs were trans-
planted into moderately contused thoracic spinal cord, they appeared
to aggregate or form trabeculae in the cysts, thus reducing the cystic
volume (Collazos-Castro et al., 2005). Immunoreactivity for GFAP and
CSPG was also reduced around the lesion site (Plant et al., 2003;
Takami et al., 2002). Although the OEC transplants contained
astrocytic processes and neurites, improvement in locomotor function
was not a consistent outcome (Collazos-Castro et al., 2005; Plant et al.,
2003; Takami et al., 2002).
Olfactory ensheathing cell transplants in the rhizotomy
injury model
Following rhizotomy, the central processes of the dorsal root
ganglion cells retain their regenerative capacity and regrow their
axons up to the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ). However, these centrally
directed axons are unable to grow through the transitional region
between thePNSandCNSat theDREZ to enter the spinal cord (Carlstedt,
1997; Chong et al., 1999). At the DREZ, reactive astrocytes normally
reform a continuous glial-pial membrane with an outward facing basal
lamina that excludes the peripheral Schwann cells and is impenetrable
to regenerating axons (Liuzzi and Lasek, 1987). The first study on OEC
promotion of regeneration after rhizotomy reported that following
injection of OECs into the DREZ, calcitonin gene-related peptide- and
GAP-43-positive axons crossed the DREZ to enter the dorsal horn of the
spinal cord (Ramon-Cueto and Nieto-Sampedro, 1994).
Li and colleagues have formulated the ‘pathway hypothesis’which
proposes that interactions between astrocytes and transplanted OECs
in the CNS establish a permissive pathway for regenerating axons (Li
et al., 2004). Experiments from Li's group showed that if OECs were
transplanted into the entry zone following rhizotomy there was
extensive outgrowth of astrocyte processes, which interwove with
OEC and Schwann cell processes, forming bridges that allowed dorsal
root axons to regenerate into the spinal cord (Li et al., 2004).
Subsequently, they propose that OECs interact with astrocytes to
49M.I. Chuah et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 46–53induce a rearrangement of tissue that creates a physical route along
which new axons can grow. However, other groups utilizing the
rhizotomy model have reported vastly different results. For example,
Ramer and co-workers reported transformation of the glial scar
following OEC transplantation after rhizotomy at the cervical and
lumbar levels, but found no evidence for axon regrowth (Ramer et al.,
2004b). The failure of OECs to promote regeneration of sensory
afferents into the spinal cord has also been reported by other
laboratories (Table 1). The reason for this discrepancy is not known
but it has been proposed that OECs are able to promote regeneration
only when the preferred migration of these cells coincide with the
direction of new nerve sprouts (Nieto-Sampedro, 2003; Ramon-Cueto
and Nieto-Sampedro, 1994). Thus a deeper understanding of the
molecular signals that govern OEC orientation and behavior in the
lesion site may be required to optimize their therapeutic potential. In
vitro studies, wheremore precise molecular techniques can be applied
on purified populations of specific types of cells could provide
valuable relevant evidence.
Do OECs require assistance from Schwann cells or fibroblasts to
elicit repair?
Despite positive outcomes being reported in several studies
following OEC transplantation, the differences in histological and
functional outcomes raises questions about their reproducibility. One
complicating issue is the infiltration of Schwann cells into the injury site.
Schwann cells have long been used experimentally to induce repair of
the injured CNS (Martin et al., 1996; Richardson et al., 1980; Xu et al.,
1997). Thus it is possible that the beneficial effects attributed to OECs
maybepartly due to interactionwith invadingSchwanncells. It has even
been proposed that OECs only play an indirect role in promoting repair,
by facilitating invading Schwann cells to form amatrix that is conducive
to nerve growth andmyelination (Boyd et al., 2005). The latter proposal
is based largely on a review of ultrastructural observations drawn from
several studies. Clearly, future studies involving molecular signaling
betweenOECs and Schwann cellswouldhelp to elucidate the role of OEC
and Schwann cell interaction in promoting CNS repair.
It is worth noting that lesion studies conducted by Li and co-workers
have used transplants that are composed of olfactory bulb-derived,
p75NTR-expressingOECs andfibronectin-expressingfibroblasts (Li et al.,
1998, 2003). They propose that the fibroblasts are crucial to the
regenerative properties of OECs (Raisman, 2001). Similarly, others
report that remyelinationbyOECs inanX-irradiation/ethidiumbromide
model is enhanced by the presence of meningeal cells in the transplant
(Lakatos et al., 2003). Olfactory ensheathing cells appeared to form
myelin sheaths around the large diameter axons in the demyelinated
spinal cords and these were separated into fascicles by surrounding
fibronectin-expressingfibroblasts. The presence of fibroblasts increased
both the remyelination of axons and the number of myelinating cells in
the lesions (Lakatos et al., 2003). It was proposed that the increase in
extracellular matrix secreted by meningeal cells contributed to
enhanced remyelination by OECs. Other beneficial effects may be
attributed to growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 secreted
by meningeal cells which promote OEC proliferation, survival and
migration over a larger area in the lesion site. Although howmeningeal
cells or fibroblasts interact with OECs in the environment of the lesion
site remains a complex issue, in vitro studies that restrictOEC interaction
to one or two specific cell populations have begun to yield some
interesting findings (refer to following section).
In vitro interaction between OECs and components of the
glial scar
In vitro studies that examine OEC interaction with astrocytes often
include Schwann cells for comparison because these two cell types have
been used as a cell-based therapy to stimulate repair (Fairless et al.,2005; Lakatos et al., 2000; Santos-Silva et al., 2007). However, the
discussion herewill focus primarily on the reciprocal influence between
OECs and astrocytes. In co-cultures with astrocytes, OECs intermingle
and migrate amongst astrocytes without forming boundaries (Fairless
et al., 2005; Lakatos et al., 2000; Santos-Silva et al., 2007). Although the
molecules mediating the spatial integration between OECs and
astrocytes are yet to be defined, the repertoire of cadherins (cadherin-
3, cadherin-5 and MT-protocadherin) and integrins (alpha 1, alpha 6,
alpha 7 and beta 4) expressed by OECs are candidates for future
investigations (Franssen et al., 2008). The net effect of differential
expressionof these proteins coulddeterminewhether specific groups of
OECs remain associated with particular clusters of astrocytes or
demonstrate a more motile behavior amongst the astrocytes.
A related issue is the question of directional cues regulating OEC
migration.Whilst several studies have reported thatOECs are capable of
migrating from the injection site, over white matter tracts and gray
matter (Ramon-Cueto et al., 2000, 1998; Resnick et al., 2003), problems
associated with certain dyes have complicated interpretation of these
claims, for example, the possibility of dye leakage or the engulfment of
dead pre-labeled OECs by macrophages. In contrast, labeling of OECs by
viral vector-mediated expression of GFP has revealed a more conser-
vative migratory capability, while others have suggested that the
eventual localization of OECs was more likely due to passive spreading
rather than active migration (Lu et al., 2006; Ruitenberg et al., 2002).
Recent in vitro experiments have indicated possible mechanisms
determining the path of OEC migration. A Boyden migration assay
revealed that OECs exhibit chemotaxis in response to tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) secreted by activated astrocytes (Su et al., 2009). The
same study also showed that following spinal hemisection, a linear
expression gradient of TNF-α was formed in the glial scar, and this
peaked at 7 days after injury. Therefore, in studies that failed to show
OEC migration, the concentration of TNF-α may have been too low. In
addition, OECs express other molecules that promote (collagen triple
helix repeat containing 1 and tenascin-C) and inhibit migration (CD9
and receptor activity-modifying protein 3) that should be considered in
future studies (Franssen et al., 2008).
The presence of OECs does not induce the stress responses of
hypertrophy or increased GFAP in astrocytes (Lakatos et al., 2000).
However, hypertrophic reaction in astrocytes can be induced in co-
cultures with OECs if the cells are exposed to medium conditioned by
Schwann cells and supplemented with heparin and fibroblast growth
factor 2, suggesting that the heparin sulfate proteoglycan profile of OECs
may be involved in modulating the reactive phenotype in astrocytes
(Santos-Silva et al., 2007). The use of an in vitro model of astrogliosis
induced by needle scratch injury, has also confirmed the modulating
effects of OECs. The resulting reactive astrocytes expressed significantly
less GFAPwhen cultured both in direct contact with OECs andwhen the
two cell types were separated by a porous membrane (O'Toole et al.,
2007). Immunofluorescence staining also suggested that reactive
astrocytes showed decreased CSPG in the presence of OECs, although
the reduction was not statistically significant.
When spinal cord injury involves the rupture of meninges,
meningeal cells invade the lesion site and become a component of
the glial scar (Silver and Miller, 2004). Thus, their interaction with
transplanted OECs is another contributing factor to the physiological
milieu. In vitro experiments showed that unlike Schwann cells which
formed clusters when co-cultured with meningeal cells, OECs
intermingled with meningeal cells and formed very small or no
clusters (Franssen et al., 2009).
Thus far, many of the studies on OEC interaction with cells of the
glial scar have employed morphological techniques such as immu-
nostaining intensities to assess how the physical aspect of the scar
may be altered by OECs. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms
involved in OEC–astrocyte interaction in future studies, using more
precise molecular biology techniques will be the new tools to
biochemically modify the lesion environment to improve permissivity
leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) at 3 days post-surgery. This
coincided with the infiltration of macrophages into the lamina
propria. Thus the data suggest that OECs could interact with
macrophages secreting IL-6 and LIF (Gauldie et al., 1987; Getchell et
al., 2002). Consistent with this possible interaction is the finding that
OECs express CX3CL1 which binds to CX3CR1 expressed by macro-
phages and dendritic cells (Chinnery et al., 2007).
TROY is a member of the tumor necrosis receptor superfamily, which
induces activation of nuclear factor kappaB and has been localized to
OECs (Hisaoka et al., 2004). Although the precise role of TROY in OECs is
uncertain, it potentially has the ability to regulate cytokine production by
OECs. Although thepresenceof the ciliaryneurotrophic factor (CNTF) and

OECs respond to a range of scenarios by producing cytokines,
chemokines and other molecules which have previously been
associated with cells of the innate immune system. This response is
amenable to molecular characterization and given the degree of
commonality associated with stress, infection and injury models, and
the likely effect of these molecules on other cells in a lesion
environment, is worthy of further investigation.
OECs and neuroinflammation
The expression of cytokines and their receptors in OECs has been
reported in a number of studies (Table 2), notably those employing
microarray analyses (Franssen et al., 2008; Pastrana et al., 2006;
Vincent et al., 2005), which have the potential to uncover even more
cytokines in the future. Microarray analyses have shown that OECs
express CXCL1 (Gro1), CCL2 (MCP-1), CX3CL1, CXCL12 (stromal cell-
derived factor-1) and its receptor CXCR4. CXCL1, CCL2 and CXCL12 are
signaling factors for recruiting neutrophils and various leukocytes
(Babcock et al., 2003; Bleul et al., 1996; McKimmie and Graham,
2010). This suggests that OECs are likely to interact with immune cells
in regulating inflammation, thus playing a role in the repair process.
Moreover their expression of CXCR4 indicates that CXCL12 could have
an autocrine effect on OEC cytokine activity.
In studies involving olfactory bulbectomy (Nan et al., 2001), OECs
upregulated their expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-6 receptor andFig. 1. PMA/calcium ionophore activate astrocytes, microglia, meningeal fibroblasts but
not OECs. Cultureswere immunostained for NFκB (red), GFAP for astrocytes (A, B), CD11B
for microglia (C, D) and p75NTR for OECs (G, H). Meningeal fibroblasts (E, F) were
delineated with phalloidin staining of cytoskeletal actin filaments (green). Nuclei were
stained with Hoechst blue (HB). The more intense nuclear staining for NFκB following
activation by PMA/calcium ionophore was observed for astrocytes (B), microglia (D) and
meningeal fibroblasts (F) but not for OECs (H). After PMA/calcium ionophore stimulation,
some microglia appeared to be highly activated, displaying rounded morphologies with
intense NFκB and CD11B immunostaining (arrowheads in D). OECs displayed variable
cytoplasmic NFκB staining in cell bodies and processes with no difference in the NFκB
staining between untreated (G) and PMA/calcium ionophore treated (H) cultures. Where
cytoplasmic NFκB stainingwas intense therewas faint nuclear staining (asterisks in G and
H) probably due to overlying cytoplasmic staining. This was confirmed by fortuitously
orientatedOECs that allowedHoechst blue-stained nuclei, devoid of NFκB, to be discerned
distinct from adjacent bright cytoplasmic NFκB staining (arrows in G and H). Scale bar is
50 μm. I: Quantitative analysis of PMA/calcium ionophore (P/I) activation of astrocytes,

than astrocytes or fibroblasts in the untreated cultures (pb0.001). PMA/calcium

microglia; pb0.001 for astrocytes and fibroblasts). Percentages are means±SEM;

its receptor in OECs (Asan et al., 2003;Wewetzer et al., 2001) is generally
thought to be associated with their axonal growth-promoting property,
its precise function is yet to be elucidated. It is known that astrocytes
upregulate their expression of CNTF as part of the gliotic response in the
aftermath of injury (Guthrie et al., 1997), while mice lacking CNTF
demonstrate motor neuron degeneration (Masu et al., 1993).
The finding that OECs produce cytokines and can function as innate
immune cells has implications for their use in CNS regeneration studies.
Olfactory ensheathing cells produce cytokines that can act on other
immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and
can phagocytose cellular debris and pathogens (Leung et al., 2008).
These mechanisms would allow OECs to modulate inflammation at an
injury site. The possibility that OECs promote neural repair by
modulating inflammation has not been subject to extensive investiga-
tion. Lopez-Vales et al. (2004) showed that photochemically-injured
spinal cordswith transplantedOECsdemonstrateda significantlyhigher
reactivity for iNOS and IL-1β at 7 days post-injury than control injuries
without transplanted OECs, while at a later time point no differencewas
observed between the two groups. Rats transplanted with OECs also
showed a higher locomotor score and improved electrophysiological
recovery (Lopez-Vales et al., 2004). However, because the OECs were
not pre-labeled prior to transplantation, itwasuncertainwhether all the
iNOS- and IL-1β-positive cells were OECs.
Cytokine production by transplanted OECs could possibly have pro-
or anti-inflammatory effects, being most likely subject to spatiotempo-
ral variation dependent on interaction with surrounding activated glial
cells and their secretions. Although inflammation initiates tissue
regeneration responses essential for wound healing (Farooqui et al.,
2007; Kracht and Saklatvala, 2002), more severe and prolonged
inflammation is associated with increased astrogliosis, secondary
neuronal damage and worse functional deficits after CNS injury (Ridder
and Schwaninger, 2009; Stichel andMuller, 1998; Swanson et al., 2004).
A key facilitator of responses associated with injury and inflammation is
the signaling pathway based on nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB), and
indeed, moderation of inflammation by limiting NFκB activation can
therefore produce beneficial effects in a variety of injury models
(Fernandez et al., 2007; Khorooshi et al., 2008). Therefore, an important
question iswhether OECs, ormolecules produced by OECs can impact on
the NFκB pathway in astrocytes and other components of the glial scar
following injury or stress.
Inflammatory activation of cellular components of the glial scar can
be induced in vitro as indicated by nuclear translocation of p65 NFκB
after treatment with the known stimulants, phorbol myristate acetate
(PMA) and calcium ionophore (Fig. 1). PMA binds to the activation site
of calcium-dependent protein kinase (PKC) (Amos et al., 2005; Tsuboi et
al., 1994), an important intracellular signaling molecule in NFκB
activation pathways (Baeuerle and Henkel, 1994; Silberman et al.,
2005). The divalent cation transporter, calcium ionophore can induce
increases in intracellular free Ca2+ (Kolber and Haynes, 1981) to
activate PKC (Medkova and Cho, 1999) and other signaling pathways
that can lead to NFκB activation (Baeuerle and Henkel, 1994;
Brettingham-Moore et al., 2005). NFκB regulates many of the protein
expression changes that characterize astrogliosis, including increased
expression of cytokines (Meeuwsen et al., 2003), chemokines (Khor-
orooshi et al., 2008), adhesion molecules (Ballestas and Benveniste,
1995), iNOS (Zhang et al., 2007), granulocyte macrophage-colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Zaheer et al., 2007) and glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) (Bae et al., 2006).

52 M.I. Chuah et al. / Experimental Neurology 229 (2011) 46–53Because activated astrocytes are the major contributor to glial
scars, it is relevant to ask whether soluble secretions from OECs could
attenuate astrocyte activation. Activation of astrocytes by PMA/
calcium ionophore was least if the astrocyte cultures were pre-
incubated in OEC-conditioned medium compared to those exposed to
microglia-conditioned medium or unconditioned medium (Fig. 2A).
These findings suggest that OECs transplanted into the injury site of
the CNS could have a role in downregulating inflammation. Given that
different lesion models induce different degrees of tissue damage and
inflammation profile, a key strategy in future studies is to determine
the optimal site and time of transplantation following injury.
In summary, although OECs have clearly produced beneficial effects
in promoting repair in several injury paradigms, there are also cases in
which their advantages as a therapeutic agent are not apparent. These
discrepancies highlight the complexity of OEC biology as well as the
intricate dynamics of cell–cell interaction in the injury site. Recent
studies have begun to investigate OEC interaction with astrocytes in
moderating the detrimental effects of glial scar. Future studies will also
need to investigate interaction between OECs and microglia, the CNS
resident immune cells, particularly in relation to OEC regulation of
neuroinflammation. These issues need to be addressed if OECs are to be
developed as a reliable and relevant therapeutic agent for neural repair.
