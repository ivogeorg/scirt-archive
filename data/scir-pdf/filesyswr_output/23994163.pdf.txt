imilocal inflammation [6], secondary necrotic cell death at the core of
the injury site and apoptotic cell death in the surrounding areas,
reaching its highest levels at about 1 week after injury [7e12]. The
ongoing demyelination [13,14] and degeneration of the fiber tracts
leads to neuronal death not only in the immediate proximity of the
primary lesion site, but also in more remote locations, such as the
motor cortex in the brain [15,16]. At this stage a number of oligo-
dendrocytes and astrocytes die in the core of the injury [10];
meanwhile, there is an activation of astrocytes at the edge of the
primary injury site. These astrocytes display an increased meta-
bolism and start to form long neurites, aiming to prevent the spread
of an aggressive environment further in both directions [17,18]. This
infiltration subsequently acts to block regeneration after SCI due to
the formation of a barrier to axonal sprouting across the lesion [19].
The activation of oligodendrocytes is another important mecha-
nism leading to the synthesis of oligodendrocyte-myelin glyco-
protein (OMG) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), both of
which have neurite growth inhibitory activity [20e22].
The chronic phase of SCI can last for years and is characterized
by ongoing demyelination [14,23,24], local inflammation and
apoptosis [25], a decrease in the number of activated macrophages,
and the formation of a glial scar and pseudocysts (also called sy-
ringomyelia) [26e29]. This phase of SCI presents a major challenge
to doctors and scientists and attracts the greatest research interest,
as most SCI patients remain in this phase, to a greater or lesser
extent, for the rest of their lives.
Regeneration of the adult CNS is limited due to weak neuronal
plasticity, an umbrella term referring to a variety of compensatory
processes (spontaneous regeneration of affected axons, dendritic
remodeling, changes in neuronal and synaptic strength) that are
taking place inside the spinal cord after the trauma in order to
overcome a number of neurites growth-inhibitorymolecules and to
restore lost structures and functions [30,31]. On one hand, these
powerful intrinsic inhibitory substances and processes that prevent
axonal growth are vital for the normal functioning of the adult
mammalian spinal cord (SC). On the other hand, these same factors
create a major obstacle for functional recovery after SCI, as well as
limit the therapeutic effects of drugs that are currently used in the
treatment of patients after SCI. Therefore, novel therapeutic stra-
tegies, by confronting the above obstacles, including the glial scar
components, providing neuroprotective support for the remaining
host cells and/or acting as an anti-inflammatory treatment, should
stimulate the regeneration of the adult CNS and improve neuro-
logical functions, thus providing an effective therapy and
improving the quality of the patient’s life.
2. Current treatment of spinal cord injury
Therapeutic approaches toward patients with SCI fall into three
separate time frames, which target the featuredmolecular events at
the particular injury phase. The first could be described as man-
agement of vital functions, immobilization, and transportation to
the emergency unit. It is directed at stabilizing vital functions and
interrupting the cascade of reactions leading to secondary injury.
The aim of the second phase is neuroprotection immediately after
the injury. This is the most critical period after the injury, therefore
most phase IeIII human clinical trials have been organized during
this period. The following groups of drugs have been tested: ste-
roids (methylprednisolone, Tirilazard) [32], opiate receptor antag-
onists (naloxone) [33], gangliosides (GM-1, Sygen) [34], the
potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (fampridine, Acorda
Therapeutics) [35], autologous cellular therapy (stimulated ho-
mologous macrophages, Proneuron) etc. [36,37]. Of these, meth-
ylprednisolone (MP) has been the only drug that has resulted in the
S. Forostyak et al. / Bioch2258significant improvement of motor and sensory functions not just inanimal studies, but also in patients after SCI in the NASCIS-3 human
trial [32,33,38]. However, an ongoing debate is in progress
regarding the mechanism, efficacy and clinical impact of MP’s ac-
tion [39]. Nevertheless, at the present time, the only standard
method to treat patients with SCI is surgical intervention, high
doses of MP and symptomatic therapy (control or management of
urinary and cutaneous infections, pain, spasticity, bladder and
bowel management, sexual and reproductive function) followed by
rehabilitation. The third therapeutic phase deals with the conse-
quences of SCI. Rehabilitative efforts aim to stabilize the current
status and to train the reflexes and residual circuits to achieve
optimal living conditions for the patient who has a given deficit.
New neuroregenerative strategies are focused on the neuro-
protection or even the replacement of the injured neurons and glial
cells by the application of various types of stem cells or their pro-
genitors [40]; however, without a permissive environment only
little progress in regeneration can be achieved. In the future,
treatment of SCI will be directed toward the enhancement of axonal
regeneration (also called rewiring) by inhibiting astroglial scar
formation and the synthesis of inhibitory proteoglycans, netrins,
semaphorines and ephrines [41e44]; modulation of inflammatory
and immune responses [45]; stimulating endogenous stem cells
[46,47]; filling the post-injury cavity by biomaterials [48,49]; or
blocking myelin-associated glycoproteins and anti-Nogo-A therapy
[50].
3. Stem cell therapy in the treatment of SCI
Stem cells are pluripotent or multipotent cells with unlimited
self-renewal capacities. In addition, they are able to differentiate
into diverse specialized cell types, including neuronal and glial cell
lineages [51,52]. It is expected that after their application into the
pathological environment within the subacute phase after SCI, the
grafted stem cells will be able to stimulate regeneration by: i) the
release of neurotrophic factors, modification of extracellular matrix
and even downregulation of some inhibitory molecules that will
promote and facilitate axonal sprouting [53]; ii) the regeneration of
damaged nervous tissue through differentiation or trans-
differentiation into mature neural cells (neurons or oligodendro-
cytes), thus promoting the remyelination of the surviving axons
and the restoration of specific connections [51,52,54e56]; iii) the
filling of small cavities, thus acting as a scaffold that will support
axonal outgrowth between the rostral and caudal stumps and
stimulating the revascularization of the damaged nervous tissue
etc. [57,58]; iv) the stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis and
angiogenesis, the secretion of exosomes, and the activation of
endogenous stem cell proliferation, migration and differentiation
toward neural cells in certain parts of the adult CNS such as the
subventricular zone (SVZ) [59,60]. Interestingly, only the subacute
transplantation of stem/precursor cells enhances the recovery of
locomotor functions, whereas during the chronic phase of SCI
monotherapy with stem cells is not enough [61]. A solution to the
above concern might be provided by the implantation of stem cells
in combination with biomaterials. Biomaterials have become
increasingly important in the development of drug delivery sys-
tems and tissue engineering approaches, and can play key roles in
overcoming the inherently insufficient protection, repair and
regeneration of the nervous tissue [62]. The creation of a me-
chanical scaffold from natural or artificially synthesized materials
and its transplantation into the transected SC or during the chronic
phase of SCI could provide a platform for the growth of host cells
and guide axons through the glial scar and post-traumatic cysts to
form new connections [63]. The implantation of a hydrogel seeded
with MSCs into a chronic lesion of the SC stimulates the regener-

clinical research of cellular interventions for SCI discussed and
himieingrowth, is well-tolerated in animal experiments and currently is
undergoing evaluation in pre-clinical trials (Fig. 1) [48,64].
4. Pluripotent and neural stem cells
Different types of stem cells have been used to promote
regeneration after experimental SCI. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
derived from blastocysts have the greatest differentiation potential,
therefore they can become an important source of oligodendrocyte
precursors, spinal precursor cells, neural stem cells (NSCs) and
motoneurons for the therapy of SCI [51,52,65e68]. One of the major
questions of cell-based therapy is to find the proper stage when the
cell can mature into the desired phenotype without causing po-
tential danger in terms of tumor formation or hyperproliferation.
The implantation of hESC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells
(OPCs) into adult rat spinal cord injuries enhanced remyelination
and promoted the improvement of motor function at early time
points after SCI, and the OPCs even differentiated toward mature
neurons showing electrophysiological activity in vivo [69,70]. If
transplanted 7 days after injury, OPCs were able to remyelinate the
spared axons as well as improve the locomotor activity of the
injured rats [71]. Past in vitro and in vivo studies have generated
neurons from animal and human ESCs that maintained a typical
motoneuronal (MN) phenotype and showed functional incorpora-
tion after intraspinal transplantation [72]. The transplantation of
NSCs has also been shown to result in functional integration of the
graft into the recipient spinal cord resulting in improved locomotor
function during the early stage of chronic SCI [73]. However, suc-
cessful neuronal replacement would necessitate the formation of
not only local functional connections, but also of long tracts of
axonal outgrowth and the formation of newly formed synapses by
the grafted cells. So far, only a few studies after acute injury of the
peripheral nerves have demonstrated newly formed functional
connections between grafted ESCs and the host muscles after
transplantation [55,74]. Nevertheless, Geron Corporation (Menlo
Park, CA, USA) announced in 2011 the enrollment of 10 patients
with complete, subacute thoracic SCI into a clinical trial involving
the administration of human ESC-derived oligodendrocyte pro-
genitor cells. [75]. This event prompted great interest and some
concerns among the scientific community, as the preclinical data
achieved from spinal cord injured rodents that underwent the
same approach of cellular therapy as the human involved in the
trial had far less severe SCI compared to the human patients;
however, due to a lack of funding the trial has been placed on
clinical hold, but is still ongoing with 5 patients recruited (http://
www.fiercebiotech.com).
A new category of pluripotent cells are induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs). Using reprogramming technology, we can generate
patient-specific pluripotent cells that are derived from adult so-
matic cells. These cells can be generated from different adult so-
matic cells by the overexpression of several different defined
factors [76]. So far, only a few reports have been published using
human iPS cell-derived neural precursors for the treatment of SCI
and TBI [77]. It has been shown that these cells restored motor
function and participated in the reconstruction of the corticospinal
tract by forming synaptic connections and integrating into
neuronal circuits [78,79]. iPS cells are a promising source for the
future; however, current human medical practice relies more on
stem cells generated from adult or fetal tissues.
The transplantation of region-specific stem cell lines generated
from fetal tissues is also a very promising strategy. A clonal neural
stem cell line from human fetal spinal cord (designated SPC-01),
conditionally immortalized by means of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen
(4-OHT)-inducible cMyc (cMycERTAM), has been shown to be

well as the future perspectives in terms of the level of evidence
required in experimental studies of cellular therapies before pro-
ceeding with clinical trials in humans [89]. A quick summary of the
cells and animal models used to treat SCI is presented in Table 1.
5. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
5.1. Characterization and origin
MSCs are multipotent, tissue-specific stem cells that are very
attractive for regenerative medicine in general as well as for neu-
roprotective and neurorestorative therapy in particular. It has also
been demonstrated that the plasticity (the ability of a cell to change
its default fate) and tissue regenerative potential of MSCs may far
exceed the primary use of bone marrow cells in the treatment of
hematopoietic diseases. MSCs represent a small fraction (0.001e
0.01 percent) of the bone marrow population. They are adherent
cells with a fibroblast-like morphology that can be isolated ex vivo,
readily differentiate into mesodermal cell derivatives and are
characterized by specific surface markers [90]. Due to the large
number of markers expressed by MSCs, the International Society
for Cellular Therapy recommended the following minimal criteria
to identify the multipotent properties of human bone marrow
MSCs (BMSCs): they should be able to adhere to a plastic surface
and express certain surface antigens (CD29, CD73, CD90 and
CD105) while remaining negative for CD19, CD34, CD45 or CD79a
and HLA class II during in vitro cultivation [91]. Despite the tissue of
origin, all MSCs can differentiate in vitro into chondrocytes, osteo-
cytes, muscle cells and adipocytes [92e94]. MSCs can be isolated
from a patient’s bone marrow by a relatively simple procedure, and
after harvesting they can be easily expanded in culture. They can
also be isolated from alternative organs such as Wharton’s jelly,
umbilical cord blood (UCB), the placenta, dental pulp and fat tissue,toward V2a inter- andmotoneurons expressing functional T-, L-, N-,
and P/Q-type Ca2þ channels, and to display spontaneous calcium
oscillations in some cells, which are typically observed in dissoci-
ated embryonic rat motoneuron cultures [80]. Transplantation of
SPC-01 cells into a rat model of spinal cord injury did not lead to
tumor formation or hyperproliferative activity, but showed long
term cell survival, the ability to fill the lesion cavity, and specific
neural differentiation 4 months after engraftment. After trans-
plantation these cells also showed better proliferation, region-
specific migration, the promotion of host tissue regeneration and
axonal sprouting into the lesion site, as well as improvements in
locomotor and sensory functions [81e83]. Human neuroepithelium
stem cells derived from fetal cortical brain tissue have been re-
ported to be a safe, non-tumorigenic strategy, that promotes the
recovery of lost function after transplantation into a rat model of
stroke and is safe to progress to clinical trials [84]. Probably the
most significant effect after the transplantation of human fetal stem
cells has been reported using a rat model of Parkinson’s disease, in
which grafted fetal dopamine neurons incorporated into the host
brain and improved motor function in a rodent model of the dis-
ease; the same effects were also observed in patients [85e87].
Perrin et al. reported an antipathic effect after an intraspinal graft of
human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), naïve or engineered to ex-
press Neurogenin-2: rats grafted with Neurogenin-2-engineered
NPCs showed significantly faster recovery as early as 7e10 days
after implantation [88]. Due to an increasing number of publica-
tions involving cellular therapy with different types of SC, 27 SCI

migration of host neurites (NF200) and Schwann cells (P75) (C) as well as the ingrowth of vessels (RECA) (D). GFP-positive BMSCs survive inside the hydrogel for at least 20 weeks
after grafting (D). The combination of BMSCs with a hydrogel stimulates a significant improvement of motor function when compared with the non-treated group; however, the
results did not significantly differ from those found in the gel-treated group (E) evaluated using the BBB motor scale. Scale bars: A, B 500 mm, C, D 50 mm. Error bars indicate s.e.m.;

5.2. Gene expression
Either bone marrow or adipose MSC populations have been
shown to express a variety of neural genes such as NCAM, NG2,
S100 and p75, as well as transcription factors, suggesting a wide
differentiation potential, including neural; however, these cells
did not show specific neuronal electrophysiological properties
[95e99]. Lattanzi et al. showed that the neurotrophic features of
AMSCs reside in their specific capability of expressing not only
secreted neurotrophins/neuroprotective molecules, but also struc-
tural protein-coding genes, mimicking astrocytic function in sus-
taining neuronal metabolism and function in the central nervous
system and being able to differentiate into astrocytes [100].
5.3. Growth factors
Despite the wide use of autologous MSC transplantation in at-
transplantation with the events that take place after SCI. It is
generally accepted that the efficacy of MSCs is based on the
secretion of a wide range of substances, either by host cells or by
the MSCs themselves (paracrine function). MSCs are known to
secrete several growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neural
growth factor (NGF), glia cell-line derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), that play a crucial
role in nourishing and protecting neurons [101e105]. After trans-
plantation, MSCs are able to mediate direct neuroprotection by
reducing neuronal sensitivity to glutamate receptor ligands and
altering gene expression, suggesting a link between the therapeutic
effects of MSCs and the activation of cell plasticity in the damaged
CNS [106]. Some studies, after comparing the in vitro properties of
AMSCs and BMSCs, have suggested that AMSCs produce a signifi-
cantly larger amount of cytokines and growth factors compared to
BMSCs; however, they have a lower differentiation potential than

ology that have been described in the literature (see the text for description).
imiIn vitro and in vivo experiments using conditioned media have
shown that the MSC secretome promotes axonal growth and neu-
roprotection [109,110]. Interestingly, it has been shown in vitro
(hypoxic preconditioning of MSCs) and in vivo (injection of secre-
tome from hypoxic-treated MSCs) that harvesting MSCs under
hypoxic conditions stimulates greater secretion of growth factors,
better stem cell survival and increased neurogenesis [111,112].
These phenomenamight be explained by the natural location of the
MSCs in sites that have reduced blood circulation, such as the bone
marrow. This makes MSCs even more attractive for transplantation
purposes, as often there is a mild edema, decreased circulation and
hypoxia in the region where stem cells are grafted (e.g., in stroke,
TBI and SCI).
5.4. Anti-inflammatory effect
An anti-inflammatory effect is another beneficial factor that is
connected with the application of MSCs via different routes. An
anti-inflammatory effect occurs mainly due to the upregulation of
the anti-inflammatory factor TGF-b1, which is dominant over the
upregulated proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines, such as IL-1b,
IL-6 and TNF-a [113e115]. The migration capacity of transplanted
MSCs and their subsequent homing to injured tissues also depends
on the state of both local and systemic inflammation and is under
the control of a large range of receptors, tyrosine kinase growth
factors and chemokines [116]. Several reports have shown the
ability of MSCs to reduce oxidative stress and even to secrete su-
peroxide dismutase [117e119]. The grafting of MSCs 3 days after SCI
modified the inflammatory environment by shifting the macro-
phage phenotype from M1 (pro-inflammatory) to M2 (anti-in-
flammatory), sparing axons and myelin [120]. The activation of M2
macrophages has been suggested as one of the mechanisms
improving cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction, as
well as one of the mechanisms underlying the regeneration of the
central and peripheral nervous systems [121].
5.5. Exosomes
Another emerging mechanism of MSC therapy is the formation
of microvesicles (MVs) that are formed in the soma of MSCs and
then released into the extracellular space. MVs (exosomes) contain
a great variety of biologically active molecules, lipids, proteins,
growth factor receptors, messenger andmicroRNA etc [122e124]. It
has been demonstrated that the therapeutic benefit of MSC treat-
ment of stroke is mediated by exosome-enriched extracellular
particles contacting the miRNA that is transferred to adjacent
neural cells (astrocytes and neurons), which evokes neurite
remodeling and brain plasticity and subsequently leads to func-
tional recovery [125].
5.6. Immunomodulation
Additionally, MSCs have been shown to have an immunosup-
pressive effect on B lymphocytes (decreased proliferation and dif-
ferentiation) [126]. MSCs also provide a permissive environment
for axonal ingrowth, stimulate functional recovery and angiogen-
esis [127,128], are immunopotent, do not stimulate alloreactivity,
increase the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, escape lysis and
inhibit the proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells
[129e131]. Maggini et al. showed that MSCs constitutively produce
prostaglandin E2 at levels sufficient to inhibit the production of
TNF-a and IL-6 by activated macrophages and also inhibit the up-
regulation of CD86 and MHC class II in LPS-stimulated macro-
phages, thus impairing their ability to activate antigen-specific
S. Forostyak et al. / Bioch2262CD4þ T cells [132]. Spaggiari et al. showed that MSCs can exert aprofound inhibitory effect on NK-cell function, because they can
suppress not only IL-2einduced cell proliferation, but also the
generation of cytolytic activity and the production of cytokines; the
authors also showed that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and pros-
taglandin E2 represent key mediators of the MSC-induced inhibi-
tion of NK cells [133].
5.7. Experimental studies on MSCs and acute SCI
Transplanted MSCs can differentiate into myelinating cells that
remyelinate demyelinated axons. These remyelinated axons, coated
with myelin and surrounded by a basement membrane, display
improved conduction velocity [134,135].
The above properties enable the allogeneic transplantation of
MSCs. A comparison between autologous and allogenic trans-
plantation into a balloon-induced SCI in dogs showed that autolo-
gous MSCs yielded a better therapeutic effect and better survival of
the cells compared to allogenic MSCs; however, despite the smaller
improvement of neurological function, allogenic MSC implantation
has some advantages from a practical aspect such as the ability to
store the cells in a cell bank, the decreased time and cost of prep-
aration, and the possibility to use much larger numbers of cells
[136]. In vivo experiments employing different SCI models and
various routes of MSC administration revealed significant func-
tional recovery, i.e. increased motor activity and sensation in the
paralyzed limbs, reduced cavity formation in the spinal cord, and
the formation of bundles that bridge the lesion and enhance axonal
sprouting through the glial scar [48,57,65,137e143]. The tissue
matrix formed by MSC grafts supports longitudinally directed
axonal growth and orientation, with their long axis parallel to that
of the spinal cord. MSCs were also oriented longitudinally in the
close vicinity of the host neurites [144,145]. It was also reported
that the intravenous delivery of BMSCs enhances remyelination
throughout a demyelinated spinal cord lesion [54]. Intraspinal
grafting of BMSCs into the injured spinal cord was shown to pro-
mote axonal regrowth and to reduce the lesion volume [140]. The
repetitive intrathecal delivery of BMSCs has been shown to improve
behavioral functions in a rat model of contusive spinal cord injury
as well as to augment the survival of the cells and their migration to
the lesion site [146]. It is important to note that after acute SCI,
there is a therapeutic time windowwithinwhich the application of
stem cells can ameliorate the consequences of secondary injury by
preserving rather than replacing the host nervous tissue [147].
5.8. Experimental studies on MSCs and chronic SCI
Despite success in the use of MSCs to treat acute SCI, there are
few studies evaluating the efficacy of MSC administration in
chronic SCI repair. Zurita has shown that the intravenous admin-
istration of MSCs three months after SCI achieved some degree of
functional recovery when compared to controls [148]. Cellular
therapy during the chronic phase of SCI aims to reconstruct the
spinal cord via cellular replacement, glial scar modification, axonal
guidance and the filling of formed syringomyelia, thus leading to
functional regeneration [48,149,150]. However, considering the
complex pathways and interactions within the spinal cord and in
the CNS, a combination of stem cells with other strategies might
bring even better results. Different methods of chondroitinase ABC
application after SCI have been shown to facilitate neuroanatomical
and functional recovery of sensorimotor functions, as well as to
stimulate the migration of host oligodendrocyte progenitors to the
lesion [151e154]. Combined therapy of chondroitinase ABC with
NPCs and growth factors led to enhanced neuroanatomical plas-
ticity in the chronically injured spinal cord, significantly improved
e 95 (2013) 2257e2270neurobehavioral recovery and axonal integrity, promoted the
plasticity of the corticospinal tract, enhanced the plasticity of
descending serotonergic pathways, and was accompanied by the
better integration, extensive migration and differentiation of NPCs
within the recipient spinal cord [155e157]. Another promising
strategy for chronic treatment of SCI is a combination of MSCs with
biomaterials. Recent advances in the application of synthetic ma-
terials, alone or in combination with stem cells/growth factors, to
treat SCI have been reviewed by Kubinova and Sykova [158,159].
6. Clinical trials of mesenchymal stem cell therapy
The above properties of MSCs, preclinical trials, along with long
experience with the transplantation of MSCs in the treatment of
hematological malignancies, led to the first clinical trials, initially to
treat myocardial infarction and later to treat stroke, SCI, ALS, PD and
other diseases of the CNS [160,161]. These and other trials utilizing
different methods of BMSC application showed that the grafting of
such cells is a safe procedure that can bring benefits for patients
[137,162e164]. Experimental studies suggest that the therapeutic
effect of grafted cells starts before the establishment of a tissue
bridge suitable for the passage of axons, therefore the recovery of
neurological functions at the early post-transplantation stage could
be explained by the activation of different regenerative processes
[149]. Based on preclinical experiments in rats with SCI that
showed significant improvement in behavioral scores after the
intravenous implantation of BMSCs labeled with iron oxide nano-
particles 7e21 days post-injury, followed by in vivo magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), a nonrandomized phase I/II clinical study

using patients with SCI was started in Prague [165e167]. In this
study a freshly isolated mononuclear fraction of autologous bone
marrow cells was grafted intraarterially (via arteria vertebralis) or
intravenously into 42 patients with SCI at the cervical or thoracic
level, and the effect of the treatment was evaluated by the ASIA
protocol, the Frenkel score system and electrophysiological mea-
surements of motor and somatosensory evoked potentials (MEPs
and SEPs) 3, 6 and 12 months after cell administration [162]. The
results of the trial showed that the transplantation of the cells is a
safe procedure. The most significant regenerative effect was
observed in 10 patients who received cells during a therapeutic
window of 10e30 days after SCI. These results correlate well with
those from clinical trials reported by Park et al. and Cristante et al.,
inwhich stem cells isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood,
combined either with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) or after cryopreservation in 6 and 39 patients
respectively, were used in the treatment of complete SCI followed
by neurologic evaluation [168,169]. One of the most recent clinical
trials delivered autologous BMSCs via lumbar puncture into the
cerebrospinal fluid of patients with subacute SCI. As a result, almost
half of the patients (45.5%) showed marked recovery (two-grade
improvement from baseline using the ASIA score impairment scale)
within 6months after cell delivery, and no side effects related to the
procedure were reported during the whole trial [170]. Apart from
the improvement of the ASIA score in SCI patients after BMSC
application (intraspinal plus intradural; additionally, through
lumbar tapping 4e8 weeks after the first procedure), Park et al. also
reported electrophysiological improvements as well as a decrease
in cavity size and the appearance of fiber-like low signal intensity
streaks on MRI [171]. The intravenous injection of autologous
AMSCs into patients with SCI also did not show any adverse effects
connected with the procedure [172].
Autologous MSC transplantation has also been shown to have a
positive effect and to be a safe procedure after application into

patients with an affected motor system (e.g., ALS or Huntington’s
disease). The long term outcome after nearly 9 years of monitoring
19 ALS patients, enrolled in two phase I clinical trials, showed no
clear clinical benefits in these patients. The collected data show
support for the implantation of autologous bone marrowMSCs into
the dorsal spinal cord, as no structural changes (including tumor
formation) or deterioration in psychosocial status were found, and
all patients coped well with the procedure [164,173,174]. The
transplantation of mononuclear CD133þ autologous stem cells
from the peripheral blood into the frontal motor cortex of ALS pa-
tients significantly prolonged the survival of the treated patients
and the maintenance of their lifestyle compared with untreated
control patients [175]. Deda et al. reported the results of a one year
follow-up after the implantation of bone marrow-derived he-
matopoietic progenitor stem cells into the anterior part of the
spinal cord of 13 patients with a bulbar form of ALS: nine patients
becamemuch better compared with their pre-operative status, one
patient was stable without any decline or improvement in his
status [176]. Our preclinical data (Fig. 2) showed that the
implantation of BMSCs into symptomatic SOD1G93A rats decreases
apoptosis in the host MN, significantly improves motor function
and prolongs the survival of cell-treated compared with vehicle-
injected rats [145]. This study formed a platform for a three year
prospective, non-randomized, open label clinical trial that was
launched in Prague (Czech Republic) in March 2012, aiming to
assess the safety and efficacy of autologous multipotent mesen-
chymal stromal cells applied to patients with a confirmed diagnosis
of ALS (http://www.sukl.eu). So far, 12 patients with a confirmed
diagnosis have been recruited for the trial and injected with
autologous BMSCs via lumbar puncture without any adverse
effects.
A large number of preclinical trials using various types of stem
cells have shown that cellular therapy has a beneficial effect in
diseases of the cardiovascular, nervous (including neurodegenera-
tive), cytoskeletal and endocrine systems. Of these, diseases of the
CNS are of special interest considering their limited therapy and
devastating character. The current achievements and future per-

imiof SCI with different types of stem cells have been summarized and
reviewed by a group of leading researchers in the field, in order to
summarize the level of evidence required in experimental studies
of cellular therapies before proceeding with clinical trials in human
SCI patients [89]. We have overviewed and summarized completed
and still ongoing clinical trials from the data available at the www.
clinicaltrials.gov database, as well as trials that have just begun
recruiting patients with SCI for treatment with MSCs (Table 3). As
one can see, despite the fact that overall hundreds of patients were
recruited into trials involving various cellular therapies, only a few
groups have published the results of their studies, whereas the
results from the others remain unavailable to the broad scientific
community. Nevertheless, the number of new clinical trials in-
creases from year to year. The explanation for this phenomenon
might be the increasing number of results from in vivo experiments,
as well as from phase I and II trials, which suggest that stem cell
delivery is a safe procedure that leads to improvements in moto-
sensory functions and tissue regeneration in up to 45% of patients,
thus enhancing their quality of life.
7. Conclusions
Though mesenchymal stromal cells were described more than
20 years ago by Caplan, recently their rediscovered multiple effects
and properties have brought new hope to the treatment of
neurological diseases [177]. The use of different methods and
routes of MSC administration into patients with traumatic, neuro-
degenerative and other diseases has shown that MSC grafting is a
safe procedure that can bring benefits for patients in the form of
improvedmotor and sensory function after transplantation. Several
reports have shown that MSCs can modify the host microenviron-
ment following CNS injury; however, most human trials have re-
ported that the therapeutic effect of MSCs starts at the early post-
transplantation stage, before the establishment of connections
suitable for their incorporation into the host tissue, and that
neurological improvement occurs within six months after the
grafting of MSCs. Logically, this raises the question whether a
recurrent graft of MSCs will further facilitate neuroregeneration?
We also need a better understanding of the mechanisms of action
and the behavior of stem cells in the pathological environment after
transplantation, in order to determine what is the best time frame
and what are the most efficient routes for cell delivery after the
injury? Another important question is whether it is necessary to
transplant a cell-containing suspension or whether the delivery of
conditionedmediawill have a similar effect? These andmany other
questions remain to be answered before MSCs or other cell types
can be translated into routine clinical practice. Other national or
international multi-center collaborative clinical trials with larger
and more homogenous groups of patients might be needed, to
enable better understanding and comparison with control treat-
ments, as well as to speed up the translation of the results into
practical applications for the benefit of patients [178].
