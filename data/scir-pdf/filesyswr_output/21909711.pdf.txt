Background
Light therapy (LT) has been investigated as a viable
treatment for injuries and diseases of the central nervous
system in both animal models and clinical trials. Based on
in vivo studies, LT has beneficial effects on the treatment of
spinal cord injury (SCI) [1–3], traumatic brain injury [4],
stroke [5–9] and neurodegenerative diseases [10, 11].
Recent clinical trials on stroke have demonstrated that light
is safe for the treatment of ischemic stroke in humans [12, 13].
The biomodulatory effects of LT have been investigated
to a much greater extent with continuous wave (CW) mode
than in pulsed mode. However, there is no clear consensus
that one mode is superior to the other. A recent review of
the published literature that compared the effects of light in
CW or pulsed mode reported that some studies have shown
pulsed light to be more effective than CW light, while other
studies have shown no effect or a worsening effect with pulsed
light compared to no treatment [14]. The studies in which
pulsed light was more effective than CW light include LT on
wound healing, pain attenuation, bone stimulation and
ischemic stroke in animal models and human studies [14].
Lapchak et al. compared CW light with two different
frequencies of pulsed light and found that transcranial
treatment with both pulsing regimes significantly improved
behavioral deficits compared to the CW light [6]. Why
pulsed light in some cases improves the outcome of LT is
currently unclear, and further investigation is needed.
Our previous studies have shown that LT promotes
axonal regeneration and functional recovery in both hemi-
section and contusion models of SCI in rats with CW laser
light [2, 3]. The purpose of this study was to compare the
effects of CW and pulsed laser light on nerve regeneration
in a hemisection model of SCI.
Materials and methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee, Uniformed Services University of
Health Sciences. The study animals comprised 15 female
Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g; Taconic Farms, German-
town, NY) which were randomized into the following three
experimental groups: control, treatment with CW laser
light, and treatment with pulsed laser light (PW). All rats
underwent SCI by dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord at
the T9 vertebral level as described previously [2, 3]. This
dorsal hemisection model of SCI results in complete
transection of the corticospinal tract, a major descending
tract connecting the cerebral cortex with the motor neurons
in the spinal cord that plays a dominant role in paralysis
after SCI.
Within 15 minutes after SCI surgery, the CW and PW
groups were transcutaneously irradiated with an 808-nm
diode laser (provided by PhotoThera). Irradiation was
delivered via a 3-mm diameter probe with direct contact
to the skin above the lesion. Both treatment groups were
treated at a power density of 0.5 W/cm2 on the skin surface
and an energy density of 1,500 J/cm2. For the CW group,
the output power was 35 mW. For the PW group, the

parameters of the light were 175 mW peak power with 20%
duty cycle, and a frequency of 100 Hz. Our previous study
showed that irradiation with the same power density and
energy did not induce significant heating at either the skin
level (1.832±0.068ºC) or the spinal cord level (0.350±
0.018ºC) [2]. Animals were irradiated for 50 min daily for
14 consecutive days. The total survival time for all rats was
3 weeks.
Ten days before the animals were killed, anterograde
labeling was performed in all groups. A total of 12 μl 5%
tetramethylrhodamine biotinylated dextran (mini-ruby;
Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was injected into the
primary motor cortex with six different coordinates (from
bregma: −0.11 AP and ±1.60 ML, −1.33 AP
and ±1.50 ML, −2.85 AP and±1.40 ML) [2]. This
fluorescence dye labels the axons in the corticospinal tract
located in the white matter [2, 3]. Axons were counted in
20-μm thick longitudinal sections of the spinal cord that
extended from the lesion site to 20 mm caudal to the lesion
using a TRITC filter (excitation 528–553 nm) and ×20
magnification using a Nikon Labophot fluorescence micro-
scope (Tokyo, Japan). Total axon number and average
axonal length were calculated as described previously [2].
A footprint test was used as a functional assessment for
this study. Briefly, animals walked along a ramp with their
hind paws inked. Their footprint pattern was recorded on a
strip of paper and measured for angle of rotation (angle
formed by the intersection of the line through the prints of
the third digit and the line through the central pad parallel
to the walking direction). Only angle of rotation was
measured in this study because our previous research
showed that other factors, such as stride length and base of
support, are not affected in this model of SCI [2, 3]. This
test was performed prior to injury (as baseline) and on days
7, 14 and 21 after injury.
All statistical tests were performed using the GraphPad
Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). One-
way ANOVAwas used to compare groups and Student’s t-test
was used for comparison between individual groups.
Significant difference was defined as a p value less than
0.05.
Results
There were significantly higher total axon numbers in both
the CW group and the PW group (504.0±150.6 and 724.8±
78.9, respectively) compared to the control group (111.3±
47.4, p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively; Fig. 1a). No
significant difference was found between the CW group
and the PW group. Distal to the lesion site, the CW group
and the PW group had significantly greater average lengths
of axonal regeneration (10.28±0.81 and 13.54±0.70 mm,
respectively) compared to the control group (6.42±
1.18 mm, p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively; Fig. 1b).
Also axonal length distal to the lesion site was significantly
greater in the PW group than in the CW group (p<0.05).
Behavioral assessment showed a significant difference in
angle of rotation in both the CW group and the PW group
compared to the control group (p<0.01) when normalized
to each group’s baseline at 21 days after injury (Fig. 2).
This reduction in angle of rotation indicated functional

between the CW group and the PW group.
Discussion
A number of recent reports on the comparison of the effects
of pulsed versus CW light indicate that pulsed light may be
more effective for LT applications than CW light. This
potential advantage has stimulated interest and research
resulting in a number of recent reports on the effects of
pulsed light in LT.
CW light irradiation results in axonal regeneration in
both the peripheral [15–17] and central injured nervous
systems [2, 3]. As for LT using pulsed light for peripheral
nerve injury, a few studies have shown either no effect or a
worse outcome compared to no treatment [18, 19]. This
study is the first to assess the efficacy of pulsed light in LT
for SCI. The data showed that pulsed laser light signifi-
cantly improved axonal regeneration in SCI compared to
untreated controls and led to a significant increase in the
length of regenerated axons distal to the lesion compared to
the group treated with CW laser light (p<0.05). Recent
studies on neurological diseases have provided some
insight into the possible mechanism involved in the
beneficial effects of CW and pulsed light treatment. Trans-
cranial laser treatment using CW light in rabbits following
embolic stroke resulted in an increase in cortical ATP of
41% and pulsed light with 5 times and 35 times more
energy delivery resulted in increases in cortical ATP of
157% and 221%, respectively [9]. Higher ATP content and
improved mitochondrial function have also been found in a
transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease following
transcranial irradiation using pulsed light [11]. Increased
ATP content and enhanced mitochondrial function could be
an acute effect which ultimately leads to normalization of
the tissue function and neurological improvement.
To date, there is no established optimal range of
parameters for pulsed light in LT. Simply following the
effective parameters established for CW light irradiation
does not ensure an efficacious treatment. Optimization of
parameters for pulsed light needs to include frequency,
duration time and duty cycle, besides the other parameters
typically used in CW light irradiation, such as wavelength,
output power, and power and energy density. In a rabbit
embolic stroke model, laser treatment with pulsed laser
light at two different frequencies (100 Hz and 1000 Hz)
initiated 6 h after stroke significantly improved behavioral
function. However, CW laser light with the same power
density (7.5 mW/cm2) and treatment time (2 min) did not
result in a statistically significant improvement [6]. In a rat
stroke model produced by permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion, CW light irradiation resulted in significant
functional improvement when applied 24 hours after stroke,
while pulsed light irradiation at a frequency of 70 Hz
resulted in a nonsignificant difference [7]. Although these
two studies used different animal models of stroke, the
difference in frequency of the pulsed light could be a main
reason for the differences in the results. In this study, the
parameters for the pulsed laser light were not optimized.
The pulse parameters chosen were based on the same
power density as used for CW laser light irradiation. The
results of this study indicate a greater efficacy of pulsed
laser light for repair of SCI. A follow-up study is planned to
optimize the parameters of the pulsed light for clinical
translation as a treatment for SCI.
For LT of a cutaneous or subcutaneous target, penetration
depth is not a major issue. However, to treat diseased or
injured tissues located deep inside the body, penetration
depth is a critical factor. Depth of penetration depends upon
the wavelength of the light used due to scattering and
absorption of the light by tissue [20]. Therefore, if the
same wavelength is used, CW and pulse modes of light will
have the same penetration depth. However, the effective
depth of penetration is determined by the depth where an
adequate amount of energy is present to cause a photobi-
ological reaction. Ilic et al. found that pulsed light could
deliver 100 times the optimal power density without
neurological damage at the cortical surface, while CW
mode caused neurological deficits, including subdural
necrosis with loss of neuronal tissue, at such a high power
density [21]. The higher safe range of output power in
pulsed light allows a greater effective penetration depth
than CW mode. Hence, pulsed light can be used to treat not
only a deeper target, such as nerves and muscles, but also
the same target in larger organisms, which would allow the
effective translation of LT from animal models to use in the
clinic.
In conclusion, CW and pulsed laser light support axonal
regeneration and functional recovery after SCI. Pulsed laser
light has the potential to support axonal regrowth to spinal
cord segments located farther from the lesion site.
Therefore, the use of pulsed light is a promising non-
invasive therapy for SCI.
