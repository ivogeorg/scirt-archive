Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a major challenge for regenerative medicine. Following SCI,
axon growth inhibitors and other inflammatory responses prevent functional recovery. Previous
studies have demonstrated that rolipram, an anti-inflammatory and cyclic adenosine
monophosphate preserving small molecule, improves spinal cord regeneration when delivered
systemically. However, more recent studies showed that rolipram has some adverse effects in
spinal cord repair. Here, we developed a drug-delivery platform for the local delivery of rolipram
into the spinal cord. The potential of drug-eluting microfibrous patches for continuous delivery of
high and low-dose rolipram concentrations was characterized in vitro. Following C5 hemisections,
athymic rats were treated with patches loaded with low and high doses of rolipram. In general,
animals treated with low-dose rolipram experienced greater functional and anatomical recovery
relative to all other groups. Outcomes from the high-dose rolipram treatment were similar to those
with no treatment. In addition, high-dose treated animals experienced reduced survival rates
suggesting that systemic toxicity was reached. With the ability to control the release of drug
dosage locally within the spinal cord, drug-eluting microfibrous patches demonstrate the
importance of appropriate local release-kinetics of rolipram, proving their usefulness as a
therapeutic platform for the study and repair of SCI.

INTRODUCTION
Spinal cord repair remains one of the biggest challenges for regenerative medicine. Recent
studies have found that spinal cord injury (SCI) is over five times more prevalent than
previously estimated, bringing the total number of people living with SCI to over one
million in the United States alone [1] . In addition, as palliative care continues to advance,
this number will continue to rise.
Severe SCI is marked by a disruption in the ascending and descending axons of the spinal
tracts. This disruption prevents vital communication between the brain and other parts of the
body. Following injury, neural cells die – namely neurons and oligodendrocytes; molecules
that are inhibitory to axon growth are secreted; and reactive astrocytes and infiltrating
macrophages facilitate glial scar formation, leading to the physical and chemical impedance
of axon growth [2-7]. These events are accompanied by active secondary degeneration of
myelin tissues, causing additional losses in neural cell populations at or near the injury site
[8, 9]. Together, these events cause paralysis and prevent natural recovery. Considering this,
a successful regenerative strategy might require a combination of therapies that have
independently been shown to mitigate the previously mentioned pathophysiologies. Before
such a strategy can become a reality, however, the efficacy and safety of each individual
therapy must be ensured.
Previous research has demonstrated the therapeutic utility of small molecule drugs such as
rolipram in spinal cord repair [7, 10]. With its anti-inflammatory [11, 12] and cyclic
adenosine monophosphate preserving properties, rolipram has been shown to promote
regeneration of new axons [13, 14], aid in the preservation of myelinated tissues [15],
attenuate acute oligodendrocyte death [16, 17], reduce reactive gliosis and subsequent glial
scar formation [14], and significantly improve functional recovery [13, 14, 17, 18] after SCI.
However, more recent studies have presented data that leave the efficacy and safety of
rolipram usage for spinal cord repair in question.
A study led by Sharp et. al. was unable to replicate the beneficial effects observed through
the subcutaneous (s.c.) delivery of rolipram in combination with the transplantation of
Schwann cells as previously reported by Pearse et. al [19]. A second report also found little
added functional recovery from the systemic delivery of rolipram with the transplantation of
a glial restricted precursor cell population [20]. Interestingly, the latter report also suggested
that the s.c. delivery of rolipram could lead to adverse effects locally within the spinal cord
(e.g., increased death of transplanted cells) as well as systemically (e.g., increased body-
weight loss and micturition peak frequencies). While others have reported the importance of
the local concentration of rolipram within the spinal cord [14], the conflict surrounding
rolipram usage for spinal cord repair remains largely unresolved.
Several groups have utilized biodegradable scaffolds for many neural regeneration strategies
[21-29]. Previously we have explored the use of natural materials [30] and synthetic
scaffolds with and without drug-delivery for spinal cord regeneration [31, 32]. Electrospun
nanofibrous patches, with rolipram immobilized to the surface via hydrophobic adsorption,
showed anatomical as well as functional improvements after a T9-T11 level SCI. The direct
combination of rolipram with the fibrous topography of patches was shown to increase axon
growth through the membrane and in the lesion, promote angiogenesis through the

membrane, and decrease the population of astrocytes and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans
at the lesion [31]. However, with only the adsorption of rolipram onto fibrous patches via
hydrophobic interactions, very little control over drug loading and subsequent release-
kinetics was achieved. A new platform with greater control over the local delivery of small
molecule drugs into the spinal cord would greatly assist in better understanding the effects
of rolipram dosage in spinal cord repair, ultimately allowing for the development of more
robust therapeutic strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microfibrous Membrane Fabrication
The assembly of drug-eluting microfibrous patches began with the fabrication of
biodegradable microfibrous membranes. Electrospinning technology was employed for this
purpose as previously described [25, 33]. Briefly, a polymer solution composed of 19% (w/
v) poly(L-lactide), M.W. 85,000 – 160,000 (PLLA, Sigma) dissolved in 1-1-1,3-3-3
hexafluoro-2-propanol (Matrix Scientific) was jetted from an electrically charged (12 kV)
single-needle spinneret and collected onto a grounded rotating mandrel (800 RPM; 10 cm
diameter). The electrospinning distance was fixed at 7 cm. Once formed, membranes where
submerged in water at 65°C and mechanically stretched to further induce fiber alignment.
For decontamination, membranes were submerged in 75% ethanol for 30 minutes and
thoroughly washed in sterile PBS.
The Assembly and Characterization of Drug-Eluting Microfibrous Patches
PRONOVA™ Ultrapure LVM sodium alginate (NovaMatrix™; FMC BioPolymer) was
used to form a thin hydrogel layer on top of microfibrous membranes. This hydrogel layer
was used as a drug excipient for the local delivery of rolipram into the spinal cord.
Removable polystyrene chamber gaskets were modified from Lab-Tek™ II Chamber
Slide™ Systems (Thermo Scientific). Chamber gaskets were placed on top of microfibrous
membranes and secured, creating a 2 cm by 2 cm well for hydrogel placement (Figure 1 A).
Five-hundred microliters of a 2% (w/v) sodium alginate solution, dissolved in deionized
(d.i.) water, was added to chamber wells and layered over each membrane surface. In order
to obtain a flat and homogenously polymerized hydrogel, this sodium alginate layer was
crosslinked using a calcium chloride-rich mist. Mist was produced via ultrasonic vibrations
generated by a Nutramist™ 3-head fog module (FutureGarden™). Following crosslinking,
newly formed alginate hydrogels were air-dried onto microfibrous membrane surfaces at
37°C overnight and chamber gas kets were removed. This process helped to slow the elution
of loaded drugs during rehydration [34] as well as reduce patch thickness for implantation.
The microscale structure of drug-eluting microfibrous patches was resolved under high-
powered scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Microfiber diameter typically ranged from
500 nm to 1 m; however, fiber diameters up to 2 m were occasionally observed.
Rolipram Loading Concentration and Drug-Release Profile
Drug-eluting microfibrous patches were loaded with variable concentrations of rolipram. To
do so, rolipram was first dissolved in DMSO (0.1 mg/ l) and then added to a larger volume
of d.i. water. An equal volume of 4% sodium alginate was then added to rolipram solutions,
bringing the final sodium alginate concentration to 2%. Final concentrations of rolipram
were 25 (low-dose) and 500 (high-dose) g/ml. The final amounts of DMSO within hydrogels
were ≤ 0.5% (vol/vol). To minimize the risk of contamination, patches were fabricated
under sterile conditions in a laminar airflow hood. In addition, all materials and devices used
were decontaminated with 70% ethanol and solutions were sterile-filtered through a 0.2 μm
filter prior to use.

To obtain the release profiles of rolipram, drug-eluting microfibrous patches were made by
using either 100 or 500 l of rolipram-loaded sodium alginate. After fabrication, patches were
submerged in 0.5 ml of PBS and incubated at 37°C fo r up to 14 days. At selected time
points (18 hours; 1.5, 3, 7, and 14 days) solution was withdrawn and the amount of rolipram
in the withdrawn solution was determined via HPLC. From this information the total amount
of released rolipram was calculated and release profiles were generated.
Cervical Spinal Cord Hemisection and Subdural Patch Implantation
All experimental procedures with animals were approved by the ACUC committee at UC
Berkeley and were carried out according to the institutional guidelines. All efforts were
made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Adult female athymic rats
(National Cancer Institute) weighing 170-243 g were used in all experiments. Four
experimental groups were included: hemisection injury with (1) no patch or treatment
(untreated), (2) empty drug-eluting microfibrous patch treatment (blank patch), (3) low-dose
rolipram patch treatment (low-dose rolipram), and (4) high-dose rolipram patch treatment
(high-dose rolipram).
Drug-eluting microfibrous patches were implanted subdurally for the direct delivery of
rolipram to the spinal cord. Laminectomies were performed on the fourth through sixth
cervical vertebrae, exposing the spinal cord at the desired lesion site. The dura was opened
with a single longitudinal incision approximately 0.5 cm in length. A fine scalpel blade was
used to create spinal cord hemisection lesions moving outward starting from the midline.
This lesion only caused damaged on the right side of the spinal cord. Each injury was
inspected to ensure the complete severance of spinal cord tissues above and below the lesion
site. Additional damage to the dura was avoided. Before implantation, patches were trimmed
down to an appropriate size (0.5 cm by 0.3 cm). Patches were then carefully implanted
underneath the dura, insuring that the hydrogel layer faced medially toward the injury site.
The dura was then sutured closed over implanted patches using 9-0 sutures. Untreated
animals received no additional therapy and the dura was closed immediately after
hemisection. In all cases, the surgery site was closed in multiple layers.
Forelimb Motor Assessment
In order to assess the degree of animal functional motor recovery after cervical SCI we
utilized the open-field forelimb recovery rating scale as previously described [35, 36].
Briefly, at various time points post injury (2 day; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks) animals were
placed in a circular foam-enclosed arena (100 cm diameter, 40 cm wall height) and scored.
Scoring was separated into six major categories: articular movement of the shoulder (2),
elbow (2), and wrist (2); stationary (2) and active (2) weight support; digit position (2);
stepping (6); forelimb-hindlimb coordination (3); and tail position (1); (note: parenthesis
denotes point totals for each category). Scores were summed to obtain an overall Martinez
forelimb score (20 points max). All rats were scored over a 4 minute time window, and all
scorers were blind to the animals’ experimental group. Open-field sessions were video
recorded for score accuracy confirmation.
Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry
Eight weeks after spinal cord hemisections, animals were sacrificed and immediately
perfused with 4% paraformaldedyde (PFA). The C2-C7 segment of rat spinal cords were
explanted and kept in 4% PFA at 4°C for 24 hours and later cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in
PBS. Cross sections of the spinal cord, through the lesion site, were cryosectioned (10 μm in
thickness) for H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) staining and immunostaining. Spinal cord cross
sections were immunostained for the following: neurofilament (NFM, rabbit polyclonal
antibody, Sigma-Aldrich) to identify axons, myelin basic protein (MBP, rabbit polyclonal

antibody, Sigma-Aldrich) for oligodendrocyte myelin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP, rabbit polyclonal antibody, Millipore) for reactive astrocytes. For chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG, mouse monoclonal antibody, Sigma-Aldrich) identification,
slides were kept in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95-99°C for 10 minutes for
antig en retrieval before the immunostaining procedure was performed. For fluorescence
signal intensity quantification, multiple images within the lesion sites of animals from each
group were captured and a threshold of intensity was defined to identify proteins of interest.
ImageJ software was then used to calculate the average total pixels per image for NFM,
MBP, GFPA and CSPG marker expression.
Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Data from behavioral scores, where
time and treatment vary, were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with repeated measures. Differences between groups were determined using Tukey’s post-
hoc test. A one-way ANOVA was used to analyze in vitro release profiles and average total
pixel quantifications. Survival data were analyzed using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test where
the survival curve of each treatment group was compared to that of untreated animals.
Linear regression analysis was performed on animal weight loss over time to determine if
slopes varied significantly from zero. For all cases, p-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. GraphPad Prism® 5.0 software was used for all statistical
evaluations.
RESULTS
Structure and Appearance of Drug-Eluting Microfibrous Patches
We used electrospinning technology to produce biodegradable PLLA microfibrous
membranes. Membranes were mechanically stretched to induce fiber alignment. After
membranes were fabricated, a thin alginate hydrogel layer was formed on top. SEM revealed
the intimate juxtaposition of the highly aligned microfibrous membrane and thin alginate
hydrogel layer (Figure 1 B) – with fibers extending outward with respect to the plane of the
captured image. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the ability of drug-eluting microfibrous
patches to encapsulate small fluorescent molecules (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI)
within their thin hydrogel layer (Figure 1 C). Membrane thickness ranged from 50 – 100 m
and the dried alginate hydrogel layer typically added an additional 5.3 m in thickness. After
rehydration, hydrogel thickness was approximately 20 μm.
Controlled Release of Rolipram from Drug-Eluting Microfibrous Patches
Drug-eluting microfibrous patches were loaded with low-dose or high-dose concentrations
of rolipram (3.1 and 62.5 g/cm2, respectively) and the subsequent in vitro release profiles
were observed (Figure 2 A, B). The low-dose concentration of rolipram (in amount per unit
area) was consistent with our previous SCI study where rolipram-loaded patches
significantly enhanced spinal cord regeneration [31]. The high-dose concentration was
chosen as an upper limit for drug loading capacity as to not compromise alginate’s gelation
properties. As expected, high-dose rolipram patches delivered approximately 20 fold more
drug than low-dose rolipram patches. It is important to note that nearly 10% of loaded
rolipram remained unreleased in low-dose rolipram patches after 14 days, leaving the
possibility of additional drug release. Release profiles showed drug-eluting microfibrous
patches were capable of maintaining a significant release of rolipram beyond 1.5 days over a
wide range of loading concentrations. Furthermore, low-dose rolipram patches exhibited an
18-hour burst release of 38.7% while high-dose rolipram patches showed a burst release of
65.6%. Both conditions demonstrated significant improvements over our previous drug-
delivery platform which, through the passive adsorption of rolipram, displayed a 4-hour

burst release of over 90% [31]. It is also worth noting that patches retained residual amounts
of their hydrogel layer after 12 days at 37°C in PBS. SEM reveals the structure of this
residual hydrogel layer relative to the membrane’s bare surface (Figure 2 C, D,
respectively).
Effect of Local and Low-Dose Rolipram on Forelimb Recovery
To assess the therapeutic utility of drug-eluting microfibrous patches for the study and repair
of SCI, rats were subjected to a C5 hemisection lesion. Immediately after injury, animals
were either left untreated or given one of three drug-eluting microfibrous patches: a blank
patch; a low-dose rolipram patch, or a high-dose rolipram patch. Figure 3 illustrates the
implantation of patches post SCI.
In general, animals treated with empty patches experienced modest improvement over
untreated animals. When animals were treated with low-dose rolipram patches we observed
drastic improvements in functional outcomes. Specifically, Martinez forelimb open-field
scores showed that animals treated with low-dose rolipram patches (n=3) score significantly
higher, from weeks 1 through 4, 6 and 8, when compared to all other animals (Figure 4 A).
In contrast, animals treated with patches loaded with 20 times more rolipram (high-dose
rolipram; n=4) showed no significant differences with respect to untreated animals (n=4).
Statistical significance of open-field score differences was assessed using a two-way
ANOVA.
Articular movement scores show early motor improvements for low-dose rolipram-treated
animals. During the first week of this study, these animals displayed significantly more
range-of-motion in forelimb joints (e.g., shoulder, elbow, and wrist). Figure 4 B shows
animal forelimb articular movement scores at 2 day and 1 week time points. After 1 week,
low-dose rolipram-treated animals scored significantly higher than all other groups. No
other scores were significantly different.
During week 8 of this study, animal forelimb-hindlimb coordination frequencies were
observed (Figure 4 C). Sixty-seven and thirty-three percent of rats treated with low-dose
rolipram patches experienced “consistent” and “frequent” coordination behaviors,
respectively. Animals in other groups experienced no consistent coordination at all. Twenty-
five percent of rats treated with empty patches (n=4) showed frequent coordination and
another 50% showed “occasional” coordination, leaving 25% with no coordination.
Untreated animals remained mostly (75%) uncoordinated. Animals treated with high-dose
rolipram-loaded patches showed no coordination whatsoever.
Effects of High-Dose Rolipram on Animal Survival
At the completion of this study we reviewed animal survival data in an effort to assess
overall animal health (Figure 4 D). Upon the recommendation of unbiased veterinary
experts, animals were sacrificed for various health-related reasons. These included excessive
weight-loss, self-mutilation, and poor general health. For untreated animals and animals
treated with blank and low-dose rolipram patches, animal survival rates ranged from
80-100%. Animals treated with high-dose rolipram patches showed a drastic drop off in
survival rate (50%). Statistical analysis reveals that this survival curve is significantly
(p<0.05) different than that of untreated animals. Although most animal deaths were
sacrificial, one animal within the high-dose rolipram group was found deceased in its cage at
week 6. There were no other cases where animal death was observed beyond the first week.
To confirm this apparent increase in toxicity, we performed an analysis on animal weight
loss over days 3 through 6 after SCI (Supplemental Figure 1). From this analysis, we

confirmed that high-dose treated animals continued to experience significantly (p<0.05)
more weight loss within the first week.
Gross Histopathology and Anatomical Improvement
Eight weeks after initial injuries, rats were sacrificed and immunohistological analyses were
performed on spinal cord tissues and patches. Spinal cord sections from each experimental
group were stained for NFM (Figure 5 A-D), MBP (E-H), GFAP (Figure 6 A-D), and CSPG
(E-H). Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the representative trends observed across all stains. In
general, animals treated with blank patches commonly showed slightly more axon
outgrowth (indicated with NFM immunostaining) into the lesion site when compared to
untreated animals. Furthermore, animals treated with low-dose rolipram patches exhibited
the greatest degree of axon outgrowth into the lesion site when compared to all other groups.
Animals treated with high-dose rolipram patches showed a drastic decrease in the number of
axons present when compared to low-dose rolipram and blank patch treated animals.
A similar trend was observed regarding the presence of oligodendrocyte cell (MBP+)
populations within the injury site after low-dose rolipram delivery. Specifically,
immunostained sections for animals treated with low-dose rolipram patches showed a drastic
increase in the number of MBP+ cells with respect to all other groups (Figure 5 E-H),
suggesting the enhancement of myelin formation and/or sparing of oligodendrocytes. Figure
5 I and J attempt to quantitatively represent the degree of anatomical recovery seen in axon
outgrowth and oligodendrocyte myelin, respectively.
As expected, animals left untreated showed a substantial number of reactive astrocytes
present within their lesion sites (Figure 6 A). The application of any type of patch seemed to
reduce the number of astrocytes seen at the lesion (Figure 6 B-D). While high-dose
treatment produced a significant decrease in the number of astrocytes present, low-dose
treatment resulted in the most dramatic decrease (Figure 6 I). After analyzing extracellular
matrix components within cord lesions we found that animals treated with low-dose
rolipram patches had no significant change in CSPG content at their lesion site relative to
animals from untreated and blank patch groups (Figure 6 E-G). Interestingly, animals
treated with high-dose rolipram patches showed a dramatically higher CSPG content (Figure
6 H) within their lesions compared to low-dose treated and untreated animals (Figure 6 J).
DISCUSSION
Many studies have outlined the beneficial role that rolipram can have in spinal cord repair.
However, recent studies suggest that its s.c. delivery may lead to systemic toxicity and less
robust functional recovery [20, 37]. Figure 7 attempts to illustrate the concerns and potential
pitfalls that may complicate the usage of rolipram through s.c. injections for spinal cord
repair. Achieving an optimal concentration of rolipram within the spinal cord requires a
complicated balance of minimizing systemic toxicity, avoiding spinal cord over-dosage, and
appropriately accounting for patient/injury variations. Furthermore, the co-delivery of other
therapeutic agents (i.e., transplanted cells) may further convolute this balance [38].
Conceptually, this may help to explain conflicting results found by previous studies. For
example, while Pearse et al. [13] demonstrated significant spinal cord recovery after
systemic delivery of rolipram, they also reported that “rats treated with rolipram showed
increased secretion of porphyrin from the eyes” indicating that some degree of toxicity was
reached. Under nearly identical experimental conditions, Sharp et al. [19] found that
rolipram offered no additional recovery over untreated animals. Using similar experimental
conditions, Nout et al. [20] showed that systemic delivery of rolipram offered little
functional recovery over untreated animals and resulted in significant reductions in animal
health. Interestingly, Nikulina et al. [14] found that rolipram offered improvements in

recovery when delivered at a rate approximately 10 times greater than the previously
mentioned studies. Even more, there was evidence that even higher dosages can yield local
toxicity within the injured cord (e.g., less regeneration). This study was, however, done
using a different injury model (e.g., hemisection versus contusion) and different rat strains
and, therefore, may be difficult to compare. Given these conflicting results and the fact that
the local rolipram concentration within the spinal cord is often unknown or unreported, we
are unable to definitively determine specific systemic dosages that are therapeutic versus
toxic. Still, these results, considered together, highlight the variability that s.c. delivery of
rolipram brings to spinal cord repair.
In an effort to avoid the complications observed with the s.c. delivery of rolipram, we
attempted to create a new and improved platform that would allow for controlled, local
drug-delivery into the spinal cord. With the incorporation of an alginate hydrogel layer as a
drug excipient, drug-eluting microfibrous patches successfully demonstrated their ability to
1) suppress the extent of burst release previously seen with our small molecule drug-delivery
devices and 2) sustainably deliver rolipram beyond 1.5 days in vitro over a large range of
drug loading concentrations. Several studies demonstrate rolipram’s efficacy even when
delivered acutely (3 days or less) [18, 39, 40]. Given this, we felt our patches were suitable
for in vivo experimentation. While our previous spinal cord patch fabrication utilized blends
of PLLA and poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), here patches were composed of only
PLLA polymer to reduce the potential influence of acidic polymer contaminants due to the
rapid degradation of PLGA. Consistent with our previous result [31], drug-eluting
microfibrous patches loaded with a low-dose (3.1 – 3.9 g/cm2) concentration of rolipram
facilitated the greatest degree of animal functional and anatomical recovery. In particular,
improvements in overall forelimb recovery as well as early forelimb joint movement were
greater for animals treated with a low dosage of rolipram. Anatomical improvements
included increases in the number of both axons and oligodendrocytes seen within the lesion
site. In addition, a decrease in the number of reactive astrocytes and the amount of CSPG
molecules present were observed. For most outcomes, patches loaded with a high-dose
concentration of rolipram appeared to have little variation from the no treatment case.
Interestingly, CSPG content within lesions, however, was much higher for animals treated
with a high dosage of rolipram. In addition, high-dose rolipram-treated animals also
displayed the lowest survival rate over the course of eight weeks suggesting that higher local
rolipram dosages could subsequently lead to higher levels of rolipram in the spinal cord and/
or body, which could ultimately prove detrimental to the overall health [41-43]. Patches
without rolipram proved only slightly advantageous when compared to the no treatment
case, thus demonstrating the need to incorporate additional therapeutic agents.
With respect to previous studies, these results suggest that by delivering a low dosage of
rolipram directly into the spinal cord, we are able to achieve comparable outcomes with less
than 1% of total rolipram delivered (over the course of 3 days). Interestingly, we’ve also
shown that a higher dosage of rolipram directly into the spinal cord (still less than 1% of
previous studies), may cause some local toxicity (less recovery within spinal cord) as well as
systemic toxicity (increased animal death and weight loss). Because the total amount of
rolipram delivered to animals is dramatically less than previous studies, we posit that the
apparent variations in outcomes after systemic delivery of rolipram (e.g., via osmotic mini-
pumps implanted s.c.) may be due to variations in the amount of drug that enters into the
CNS through the blood-brain barrier and injury site.
It is important to note that unlike other rolipram related SCI studies, our model utilizes
athymic animals. Several other SCI studies have used similar models to help promote the
acceptance of xenogenic donor cells after transplantation. Because many of our previous and
future studies aim to understand the combined effects of drug-delivery, fibrous scaffolds,

and human stem cell transplantation on neural regeneration, an athymic animal model was
chosen for clear comparison. This study suggests that drug-eluting microfibrous patches,
through a local drug-delivery approach, have the ability to more clearly distinguish optimal
and sub-optimal drug dosages for spinal cord repair. In order to further improve recovery
and to more thoroughly study the effects of combination therapies on spinal cord repair,
future studies will aim to explore the combined delivery of rolipram with other therapeutic
agents (i.e., other drugs and/or cells) in addition to creating a more bioactive, cell adhesive
hydrogel layer. Release-kinetics will be further improved through additional modifications
aimed to enhance hydrogel stability on microfibrous membranes - through the use of various
crosslinkers [34] and functional chemistry - thus, preventing rapid hydrogel erosion and
delamination.
CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the potential of drug-eluting microfibrous patches as a drug-
delivery platform for the local release of rolipram into the injured spinal cord. Here we
distinguish the therapeutic outcomes observed from the subdural implantation of patches
loaded with low and high doses of rolipram. Patches loaded with lower concentrations
yielded significant improvements in functional and anatomical recovery. With increasing
loading concentration both functional and anatomical improvements diminished and overall
animal health worsened. In all, this study demonstrates the therapeutic utility of drug-eluting
microfibrous patches in the study and repair of SCI.

Figure 7.
A schematic illustrating the complex balance involved in the s.c. delivery of rolipram to the
injured spinal cord for repair. Because only a fraction of the total amount of rolipram
delivered s.c. to the patient will reach the spinal cord, systemic rolipram concentrations
reach unnecessarily high levels, increasing toxicity related risks. In addition, injury-to-injury
and/or patient-to-patient variations can cause uncertainty in the local concentration of
rolipram within the spinal cord. As we have shown, inappropriate local concentrations of
rolipram within the spinal cord can be detrimental to regeneration. Much of the uncertainty
in local spinal cord and systemic rolipram concentrations can be removed with the local
delivery of rolipram via drug-eluting microfibrous patches.
