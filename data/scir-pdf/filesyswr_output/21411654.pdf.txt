Spinal cord injury elicits an inflammatory response that recruits macrophages to the injured spinal cord. Quantitative real-time PCR
results have shown that a repair strategy combining peripheral nerve grafts with acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) induced higher
interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and IL-13 levels in the graft areas of rat spinal cords comparedwith transected spinal cords at 10 and14d. This
led tohigher arginase I-positive alternatively activatedmacrophage (M2macrophage) responses. The gene expressionof several enzymes
involved in polyamine biosynthesis pathways was also upregulated in the graft areas of repaired spinal cords. The treatment induced a
twofold upregulation of polyamine levels at 14 d, as confirmed by HPLC. Polyamines are important for the repair process, as demon-
strated by the observation that treatment with inhibitors of arginase I and ornithine decarboxylase attenuates the functional recoveries
of repaired rats. After 14 d, the treatment also induced the expression of neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well asM2macrophages within grafted nerves expressing BDNF. IL-4 was upregulated in the injury sites
of transected rats that received aFGFalone comparedwith those that receivednerve grafts alone at 10d. Conversely, nerve graft treatment
induced NGF and BDNF expression at 14 d. Macrophages expressing polyamines and BDNF may benefit axonal regeneration at 14 d.
These results indicate that aFGF and nerve grafts regulate differentmacrophage responses, andM2macrophagesmay play an important
role in axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury in rats.
Introduction
The failure of axons to regenerate following CNS trauma re-
sults from decreased intrinsic properties of the neurons (Faw-
cett, 1992; Park et al., 2008; Kadoya et al., 2009), the absence of
neurotrophic factors (Markus et al., 2002), and the presence of
inhibitory factors in the environment (Filbin, 2003). Spinal
cord injury (SCI) elicits an inflammatory response that re-
cruits macrophages to the injured spinal cord. Macrophages
can remove myelin debris after injury and produce a mixture
of growth factors, cytokines, and growth-promoting surface
molecules (Fawcett and Keynes, 1990; Perry and Brown, 1992;
Yin et al., 2006).
The diversity of macrophage functions is endowed by unique
cytokine stimuli (for review, see Gordon, 2003; Mantovani et al.,
2004;Mosser and Edwards, 2008;Martinez et al., 2009; Varin and
Gordon, 2009). The “classically activated” M1 macrophages re-
spond to the proinflammatory cytokine interferon- (IFN-)
and acquire the capacity for killing pathogens. M1 macrophages
produce nitric oxide, proinflammatory cytokines, and matrix
metalloproteinases, which cause tissue damage (Ueta et al., 1998)
and axonal retraction (Busch et al., 2009). In contrast, the “alter-
natively activated” M2 macrophages respond to interleukin-4
(IL-4) and IL-13 and are involved in tissue repair. These macro-
phages are relatively inept killers of intracellular pathogens
(Rutschman et al., 2001). They produce several extracellular ma-
trix proteins thatmay promote tissue remodeling and repair (Go-
erdt and Orfanos, 1999; Gratchev et al., 2001). In addition, M2
macrophages promote axonal growth and overcome inhibitory
substrates (Kigerl et al., 2009). Reparative approaches usingmac-
rophages implanted into the injured spinal cord have resulted in
successful axonal regrowth or functional benefit (Rapalino et al.,
1998; Knoller et al., 2005). Whether these cells aggravate second-
ary injury or promote wound repair likely depends on the phe-
notypes triggered by signals in the environment.

An SCI repair strategy using peripheral nerve grafts and acidic
fibroblast growth factor (aFGF, FGF-1) improves hindlimb loco-
motor function in spinal cord-transected rats (Cheng et al., 1996;
Lee et al., 2002, 2004; Tsai et al., 2005). Repaired spinal cords
induce the expression of the M2 macrophage marker arginase I
(Arg I) 6–14 d after repair and recruited large numbers of M2
macrophages to the graft area 10 d after repair (Kuo et al., 2007).
These findings suggest that some molecular mechanisms trig-
gered by the repair process in the early stage of spinal cord injury
are important for modulating macrophage activation and pro-
moting axonal regeneration. To determine how aFGF and pe-
ripheral nerve grafts regulate macrophage functions, we used
quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) to analyze the expression of
cytokines, macrophage markers, polyamine synthesis enzymes,
and neurotrophins in spinal cords. Inhibitors of polyamine syn-
thesis enzymes were used to evaluate the effect of polyamines on
the functional recovery of rats in which spinal cord repair was
performed. The individual effects of aFGF and nerve grafts on
macrophage function were examined in spinal cord-transected
rats that received either aFGF alone or nerve grafts alone.
Materials andMethods
Experimental animals
Adult female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (225–250 g) were used in this
study. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animals
Committee of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Surgical procedures,
postoperative care, and monitoring have been described previously
(Cheng et al., 1996, 1997; Kuo et al., 2007). The rats were separated into
several groups: group N, normal rats (n  4); group T, spinal cord-
transected rats (n 4), in which the spinal cords were completely tran-
sected at T8 and 5 mm of spinal cord tissue was removed; and group R,
spinal cord-transected rats that received an in vivo repair strategy devel-
oped by Cheng (Cheng et al., 1996) (n 4–5). In the latter, autologous
peripheral intercostal nerve segments combined with aFGF in a fibrin
glue carrier were implanted to bridge the 5 mm gap in the transected
spinal cords. The experimental designs for Groups N, T, and R are illus-
trated in Figure 1A.
Another three groups of experimental animals were used to evaluate
the effect of fibrin glue, intercostal nerve grafts, and aFGF. Group U
consisted of spinal cord-transected rats that received fibrin glue in the
gap (n  4). Group I consisted of spinal cord-transected rats that re-
ceived autologous peripheral intercostal nerve grafts in fibrin glue (n

In contrast, the graft areas of repaired spinal cords sustained the expression of these cytokines and IFN- (B). From 6 to 14 d, significantly higher IL-10 and IL-13 levels were found in repaired spinal
cords comparedwith normal spinal cords, and the levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 increased in the graft areas of repaired spinal cords comparedwith injured spinal cords. #p 0.05, ##p 0.01 for

4). Group F consisted of spinal cord-transected rats that received aFGF in
fibrin glue (n  4). The experimental designs of group U, I, and F are
illustrated in Figure 7A (see below).
To study the effects of inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis, group R rats
were treated with either N-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (NOHA) (Calbio-
chem, 10 M in fibrin glue), a competitive inhibitor of Arg I (n 4), or
DL--difluoromethylornithine hydrochloride (DFMO) (Calbiochem, 10
M in fibrin glue), an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase
(ODC) (n 4).
RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and quantitative real-time
PCR analysis
On specified days following injury, the rats received an overdose of so-
dium pentobarbital. The procedure for collecting spinal cord tissues
from experimental animals for RNA isolation is illustrated in Figures 1A
and 7A. Samples designated “P” were collected from 1-cm-long spinal
cord segments rostral to the injury sites, samples designated “L” were
collected from the graft areas of repaired spinal cords or the lesion sites of
injured spinal cords, and samples designated “D” were collected from
1-cm-long spinal cord segments caudal to the injury sites. Total cellular
RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was primed
with oligo dT and then reverse-transcribed using Superscript Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen), as described previously (Ma et al., 2003).
cDNA levels (n  4–5 per group) were quantified using primer pairs
(Table 1) and a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) on a Light
Cycler 480 (Roche Applied Science). Both ribosomal protein L13A
(RPL13A) and -actin were used as reference genes in each set of reac-
tions, and RPL13A was used as an internal control for normalization
(Jesnowski et al., 2002; Tian et al., 2007). Melt curve analyses verified the
formation of the single desired PCR product. Each sample was run in
duplicate. The relative differences in expressions between groups were
analyzed on the basis of cycle time values using the comparative thresh-
old cycle (Ct) method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001), in which Ct is the
cycle exhibiting the first detectable increase in SYBRGreen fluorescence.
The target gene quantity was normalized with a reference gene using the
following formula: 2(Ct(target)  Ct(reference)).
Determination of polyamine concentrations
Spinal cord segments comprising a 1 cm rostral stump, the lesion site,
and a 1 cm caudal stump were collected from transected and repaired
spinal cords and weighed immediately (n  4 per group). The tissue
was then homogenized in cold PBS containing 50% trichloroacetic
acid. Extracted fluid-containing polyamines were derivatized with
benzoyl chloride, as described previously (Morgan, 1998). The ben-
zoylated polyamines were then separated and quantified by HPLC
(Waters) with a reverse-phase (C18) column (Inertsil 7 ODS-3 4.6
150 mm, Vercopak) and a UV detector (229 nm) at room tempera-
ture. The solvent system was run isocratically using 60% (v/v) meth-
anol and a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Standard curves were obtained by
measuring a series of known amounts of each polyamine. Determina-
tions used four experiments.
Immunohistochemistry
At the specified postinjury times, the rats received an overdose of
sodium pentobarbital and were perfused intravascularly with 0.9%
saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The spinal cords were col-
lected and prepared for histological evaluation as described previ-
ously (Kuo et al., 2007). The primary antibodies used were as follows:
rabbit anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1) (1:
500, Wako Chemicals); mouse anti-ED1 (1:1000, Serotec); goat anti-
Arg I (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); mouse anti-ODC (1:
500, Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-spermine (1:250, Millipore Bioscience
Research Reagents); rabbit anti-spermidine (1:100, Abcam); chicken
anti-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (1:100, R&D Systems);
mouse anti-growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43, 1:150, Invitrogen);
rabbit anti-CD86 (1:200, Abcam); and goat anti-mannose receptor
(CD206, 1:200, R&D Systems). The bound antibodies were visualized

using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit;
Vector Laboratories Inc.) with appropriate chromagens. The secondary
antibodies used for fluorescence microscopy were Alexa Fluor 488
(AF488) (1:500, Invitrogen)-, AF594 (1:500, Invitrogen)-, and AF568
(1:500, Invitrogen)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Photo imageswere
taken from stained slides of sections with a Zeiss Axioscope microscope,
and the imageswere collected and arranged inAdobe Photoshop. Immuno-
fluorescently labeledM1 andM2macrophages were defined by CD86- and
CD206-positive cells, respectively (Kigerl et al., 2009). The proportional ar-
eas of cells expressing either M1 or M2 antigens were quantified by NIH
ImageJ 1.44d software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda,MD) in four longitudinal sections in the graft areas of each 14 d
repaired rat (n  3). Regenerating axons were identified by GAP-43
immunoreactivity. GAP-43-positive areas were quantified by NIH Im-
ageJ in four longitudinal sections in the graft areas of each 6 and 14 d
repaired rat (n 3 per group).
Axonal tracing
Injections of recombinant adenoviruses result in specific and high-yield
gene transfer into neurons and enable monitoring of retrograde trans-
gene expression (Finiels et al., 1995; Han et al., 2005). Therefore,
recombinant adenovirus carrying green fluorescence protein (Ad-
GFP) was used to trace neurons, as described previously (Tsai et al.,
2010a). Two weeks after repair surgery, each rat was anesthetized and
received a laminectomy below the injury site. Ad-GFP (titer  10 6
pfu) was injected slowly below the grafted areas (T9) of the spinal
cords using a micromanipulator. Three days after the injection, each
animal was deeply anesthetized and perfused intracardially. GFP ex-
pression in the Ad-GFP-infected spinal cords was visualized using
anti-mouse GFP (1:500, Abcam) coupled with Alexa Fluor488 donkey
anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen).
Regenerating neurons were traced using cholerotoxin B (CTB)-HRP
(Sigma-Aldrich), as described previously (Huang et al., 2009). Three
months after repair surgery, rats were anesthetized and received laminec-
tomies above the injury sites. CTB-HRP was injected above the grafted
areas (T7) of the spinal cords. Two days after the injections, the animals
were deeply anesthetizedwith sodiumpentobarbital and perfused intrac-
ardially. The spinal cords from T6 to L3 were removed for cryostat sec-
tioning. The sections underwent reaction with diaminobenzidine
(Sigma-Aldrich) before microscopic examination. The morphologies of
the spinal cords were microscopically examined and recorded.
Cell cultures and treatments
Mixed neuron-glial cultures. Mixed neuron-glial cultures were prepared
from the cerebrocortical regions of embryonic SD rat fetuses at15–17
d gestation, as described previously (Tsai et al., 2005, 2007, 2010b).
Briefly, fetal cortexes were dissociated with mixtures of papain/protease/
deoxyribonuclease I (0.1/0.1/0.03%) and plated onto poly-lysine-coated
multiwell plates or insert wells (for cocultures). Cultures were main-
tained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with N2 (Invitrogen, for
serum-free condition) or with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitro-
gen). The cells were incubated at 37°C in awater-saturated atmosphere of
5% CO2/95% air.
Microglial cultures. Microglial cultures were purified from confluent
mixed glial cultures. Mixed glial cultures were prepared from the neona-
tal cortical regions of SD rats as described previously (Tsai et al., 1996,
1997). Briefly, mechanically dissociated cortical cells were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37°C in a water-
saturated chamber. The medium was renewed every 2–3 d. Eight to 10 d
later, microglial cells were collected using the shake-off method (McCar-
thy and de Vellis, 1980) and replated onto multiwell plates. More than
98% of the cells weremicroglia, as identified by positive immunoreactiv-
ity for ED-1, a microglial marker.
Mixed neuron-glial cultures were maintained in serum-free medium.
Cells with or without 150 M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure were
treated with 50 ng/ml aFGF (PeproTech), 20 M spermidine (Sigma-
Aldrich), or 100 ng/ml BDNF (PeproTech) for 48 h. Cultures were then
fixed with 4% paraformaldehye and processed for immunostaining.
Neurons were stained with an antibody against the neuronal markerIII
tubulin (1:500, Covance).
For neuron-macrophage coculture, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma-
Aldrich)/IFN- (R&D Systems) or IL-4 (R&D Systems) were used to
stimulate microglia differentiation into M1 or M2 phenotypes, respec-
tively. LPS (0.5 g/ml) and IFN- (10 ng/ml) or IL-4 (10 ng/ml) were
added to microglia cultures for 2 d. Then, mixed neuron-glial cultures
were seeded in Transwell plates (Millicell, Millipore Corp.), transferred
to microglia-seeded cultures (as cocultures), and further incubated for
2 d. Microglial cells were stained for M1 [inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), 1:400, BD Transduction Laboratories] andM2 (CD206)macro-
phage markers, whereas Transwell cells were stained for III tubulin.
Immunoreactivites were quantified with NIH ImageJ 1.44d software in
three independent experiments.
Behavioral evaluation
The Basso, Beattie and Bresnehan (BBB) open field score was used to
evaluate locomotion in terms of hindlimb functional improvement of
the rats with spinal cord injuries (Basso et al., 1995). The BBB test was
scored from 0 (no observable hindlimb movement) to 21 (normal hind
movement) points. In this study, behavior analyseswere conducted every
week postsurgery until 8 weeks (n  4 per group). The behavior tests
were recorded by video camera, and the two examinerswere blind to each
behavior evaluation group.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons were performed using the two-tailed Student’s t
test. p-values 0.05 were used to indicate statistically significant differ-
ences between groups.
Results
Th2 cytokines andM2macrophages dominate the graft areas
of repaired spinal cords
To determine whether aFGF and peripheral nerve grafts provide
environments that favor differentiation toward the M2 macro-
phage phenotype in repaired spinal cords, we examined the ex-
pression of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in spinal cord tissues using
Q-PCR analysis. The expression of tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) and IL-10 displayed transient induction 2 d after injury
and returned to a normal state after 6 d (Fig. 1C,E). In contrast,
repaired spinal cords exhibited a second notable upregulation of
all Th2 cytokine expressions after 10 d. At 10 and 14 d, signifi-
cantly higher IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 levels were found in the graft
areas of repaired spinal cords compared with the normal group.
Figure 2. M2 macrophages dominate within the graft areas of 14 d repaired spinal cords.
Sections of 14d repaired spinal cordswere stained for CD86 (M1) andmannose receptor (CD206,
M2). A large number of M2 macrophages were found in the grafted areas. Scale bar, 100m.
Quantitation ofmacrophages expressingM1 andM2markers in the grafted areas revealed that
therewere 74%M2macrophages in the grafted areas of 14 d repaired spinal cords ( p 0.001
from three rats by Student’s t test).

In addition, all Th2 cytokines in the graft areas were higher than
in injured spinal cords (Fig. 1D–F). This induction of Th2 cyto-
kines was accompanied by a temporary upregulation of IFN-
andTNF at 10 d (Fig. 1B,C). The upregulation of Th2 cytokines
was prominent in the graft areas of 10 d repaired spinal cords,
exhibiting levels in the graft areas that were approximately eight
times higher than those obtained in the stumps (Fig. 1G–I).
To determine whether an increase in Th2 cytokine secretion
leads to anM2macrophage response in repaired spinal cords, the
populations of M1 and M2 macrophages in 14 d repaired spinal
cords were examined by immunostaining forM1 andM2 pheno-
typic markers (CD86 and mannose receptors (CD206), respec-
tively). Large numbers of M2 macrophages were found in the
grafted areas of 14 d repaired spinal cords (Fig. 2). Quantitation
of macrophages expressing M1 and M2 markers in the grafted
areas revealed that there were 74% M2 macrophages in the
grafted areas of 14 d repaired spinal cords.
Next, we analyzed the expression of Arg I and iNOS. Q-PCR
confirmed that the M2 macrophage marker Arg I was signifi-
cantly higher in the graft areas of repaired spinal cords than in
transected spinal cords from 6 to 21 d (Fig. 3B). Repaired spinal
cords significantly upregulated the levels of Arg I, as opposed to
theM1macrophagemarker iNOS (Fig. 3C). Immunohistochem-
istry demonstrated a larger number of Arg I-positive cells in the
graft areas of repaired spinal cords compared with transected
spinal cords at 10 d postinjury (supplemental Fig. 1A,B, available
at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Arg I colocal-
ized with the Iba1-positive macrophages (supplemental Fig. 1C,
available at www.jneurosci.org as supplementalmaterial). Corre-
spondingly, aFGF and peripheral nerve grafts provided environ-
ments that induced Th2 cytokine expression and activated
recruited macrophage differentiation toward the M2 phenotype.
Upregulation of polyamine biosynthesis is necessary for
functional recovery of spinal cord-repaired rats
L-Arginine is the common enzymatic substrate of Arg I in M2
macrophages and iNOS in M1 macrophages. Arg I hydrolyzes
arginine into ornithine, the first building block in the synthesis of
polyamines. Using Q-PCR, we analyzed the expression profiles
for a set of enzymes involved in the polyamine biosynthesis path-
way (Fig. 3A). In the graft areas, gene expression of Arg I, iNOS,
and agmatinase (AGM) was upregulated after injury and repair.
Arg I and AGM levels in group R were significantly higher than
those in group T from 6 to 21 d and 14 to 21 d, respectively. The
expression ofODC and spermidine synthase (SdS)were higher in
group R at 14 d and 14–21 d, respectively (Fig. 3E,F). However,
the expression of spermine synthase was decreased after injury
(Fig. 3G). Therewas increased gene expression of theArg I/AGM/
ODC/SdS pathway in the graft areas of repaired spinal cords.
High levels of spermine immunoreactivities were also found in
cells within the grafted nerves in the 10 d repaired spinal cords
(supplemental Fig. 2A, available at www.jneurosci.org as supple-
mental material). Immunofluorescent double labeling demon-
strated that many macrophages within the grafted nerves were
spermine-positive (supplemental Fig. 2B,D, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and colocalized with Arg
I (supplemental Fig. 2E,G, available at www.jneurosci.org as sup-
plemental material) and ODC (supplemental Fig. 2H, J, available
at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).

Q-PCR and immunohistochemistry
data suggest that the upregulation of
polyamine biosynthesis enzymes in-
creases the production of polyamines in
repaired spinal cord tissue. HPLC anal-
ysis of spinal cord polyamine levels con-
firmed this hypothesis. There is a
marked and rapid increase in polyamine
putrescine after injury. The induction of
putrescine in injured and repaired spi-
nal cords peaked at 2 d and then de-
clined. The accumulation of putrescine
in repaired spinal cords was maintained
and was significantly higher than in
transected spinal cords after 10 d. The
repair induced an2-fold upregulation
of putrescine, spermidine, and sperm-
ine levels at 14 d compared with the
transected spinal cords (Fig. 4A–C).
These data demonstrate that aFGF and
peripheral nerve graft treatment in-
duces polyamine enzyme expression
and polyamine production in repaired
spinal cords.
Evaluation of locomotor recovery over
an 8 week period demonstrated that the
repair strategy provided better functional
recovery among spinal cord-transected
rats after 3 weeks (Fig. 4D). NOHA is a
competitive inhibitor of Arg I, andDFMO
is an irreversible inhibitor of ODC. Both
are inhibitors of the polyamine synthesis
pathway. To determine whether the improvement in locomotor
recovery was dependent on this pathway, NOHA and DFMO
were included in the fibrin glue when spinal cord-transected rats
received aFGF and peripheral nerve grafts. NOHA- and DFMO-
treated repaired rats exhibited slightly worse locomotor recovery
at 3 weeks compared with the repaired animals. DFMO-treated
animals exhibited significantly worse locomotor recovery after 7
weeks (Fig. 4D). We did not evaluate behavioral assessment lon-
ger than 8 weeks in this study, but in our previous studies, the
motor function of repaired rats improved further from 6 to 12
months (Cheng et al., 1996). This is evidence that the activities of
Arg I and ODC are important for the functional recovery of spi-
nal cord-repaired rats and that polyamines play an important role
in the repair processes.
BDNF and nerve growth factor are upregulated in the graft
areas of repaired spinal cords
Macrophages express neurotrophins of the nerve growth factor
(NGF) gene family and contribute to nerve regeneration and
repair after injury. The expression of NGF and BDNF was ana-
lyzed by Q-PCR analysis. NGF expression was quickly upregu-
lated after injury and repair at day 2 and was maintained at a
higher level than in normal spinal cords to 21 d. In the repaired
spinal cords, NGF levels were greater than in transected spinal
cords at 14 and 21 d (Fig. 5A). BDNF expression was slightly
decreased after injury and was significantly induced in the graft
areas of repaired spinal cords at 14 and 21 d (Fig. 5B). High
immunoreactivities of BDNF were found in the grafted nerves of
repaired spinal cords. At 14 d, immunofluorescent staining of the
grafted nerves of repaired spinal cords displayed Iba1-positive
macrophages that were colocalized with BDNF immunoreactiv-
ities (Fig. 5C). Arg I-positive M2 macrophages in grafted nerves
also colocalized with BDNF (Fig. 5D).
BDNF- and spermidine-expressing macrophages in the
grafted nerves of spinal cords at 14 dmay promote axon
regeneration
Immunostaining ofGAP-43was used to determinewhetherBDNF-
and polyamine-expressing macrophages benefit axon regeneration
in repaired spinal cords. GAP-43-positive axons were mainly de-
tected in the stumps but not in the grafted nerves of repaired spinal
cords at 6 d (Fig. 6A). In contrast, a large number of GAP-43-
positive axonswere found in the grafted nerves and ventral portions
of the graft areas of repaired spinal cords at 14 d (Fig. 6B). Quanti-
tation of proportional areas of GAP-43 immunoreactivity in the
grafted areas of 6 and 14 d repaired spinal cords revealed that
GAP-43 immunoreactivity in the grafted areas of 14 d repaired spi-
nal cords was10 times that obtained at 6 d ( p 0.01 by Student’s
t test). This increase in GAP-43 immunoreactivities at 14 d im-
plies that these axons constitute regenerating axons rather
than axons remaining in the grafted nerves. If this is the case,
then axons grew into the grafted nerves and were surrounded
by Iba1-positive macrophages (Fig. 6C). As mentioned above,
macrophages in the grafted nerves expressed BDNF and poly-
amines. Thus, axons seem to prefer the direction of the grafted
nerves and to be accompanied by BDNF- and spermidine-
expressing macrophages (Fig. 6D,E).
Two weeks after repair, recombinant Ad-GFP was injected
below the grafted areas (T9) of spinal cords and used to trace
neurons. Several GFP-positive regenerating axons were found
along the grafted nerves and approaching the rostral stumps (Fig.
6F–J). CTB-HRP labeling was used to confirm the presence of

the regenerating neurons. Three months after repair, CTB-HRP
was injected above the grafted areas (T7) of the spinal cords. The
presence of regenerating neurons was confirmed by the observa-
tion of CTB-HRP-positive neurons in the dorsal horns of the
lumbar areas of repaired spinal cords (Fig. 6K,L). In vitro results
revealed increased immunoreactivities of III tubulin in rat em-
bryonic cortical neurons cocultured withM2macrophages (sup-
plemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material). In addition, both aFGF and spermidine combinedwith
BDNF promoted immunoreactivities of III in cortical neuron
cultures (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material). Therefore, macrophages expressing
polyamines and BDNF may benefit axonal regeneration.
aFGF induces IL-4 andM2macrophage marker Arg I
expression, whereas nerve grafts induce NGF and BDNF
expression
Our repair strategy used aFGF and peripheral nerve grafts in
fibrin glue. To explore whether the upregulation of Th2 cyto-
kines, the M2 marker Arg I, and neurotrophins is dependent on
aFGF or nerve grafts, three additional groups of experimental
animals were prepared. Group U consisted of spinal cord-
transected rats that received fibrin glue in the lesion site, group F
consisted of transected rats that received aFGF in fibrin glue, and
group I consisted of transected rats that received peripheral in-
tercostal nerve grafts in fibrin glue (Fig. 7A). Q-PCR analysis
revealed that aFGF alone induced higher IL-4 expression at 10 d
than nerve grafts alone (Fig. 7B). There was a trend toward an
increase in IL-4 that correlated positively with the expression of
M2 marker Arg I induced by aFGF treatment (Fig. 7B,G). In
contrast, aFGF had no significant effect on the expressions of
IFN-, TNF, and M1 marker iNOS (Fig. 7E,F,H). The same
fibrin glue components were used in Groups R, U, F, and I, and
these components may upregulate the levels of IL-10 and IL-13
(Fig. 7C,D). Meanwhile, nerve grafts distinctly induced the ex-
pression of NGF at 10 and 14 d compared with aFGF treatment
alone (Fig. 7I). In addition, the upregulation of BDNF in the 14 d
graft-treated spinal cords is consistent with the increase in re-
paired spinal cords (Fig. 7I). Therefore, nerve grafts play an im-

portant role in the upregulation of neurotrophins in repaired
spinal cords after 10 d. Toward this end, these results indicate that
aFGF and nerve grafts regulate IL-4 and neurotrophin expression
independently and that a simultaneous full repair strategy pro-
duces both beneficial effects.
Discussion
Our goal was to identify the cellular and molecular changes after
peripheral nerve grafts and aFGF treatment that improve
hindlimb locomotor function of spinal cord-transected rats. Pre-
vious studies have demonstrated a variety of crucial functions of
aFGF in the nervous system (Mason, 2007; Tsai et al., 2008), and
intercostal nerve grafts have been implicated in redirecting spe-
cific pathways fromwhite to graymatter (Cheng et al., 1996). The
present study demonstrated that the repair strategy using both
aFGF and nerve grafts modulates macrophage activation, poly-
amine production, and neurotrophin expression, all of which are
important for functional recovery. The Th status of SD rats after
SCI is a mixed type of Th1 and Th2, and it is speculated that a
systemic Th2 shift in the microenvironment would benefit CNS
wound healing (Hendrix and Nitsch, 2007). In our full transec-
tion rat model, TNF and IFN- levels were increased 10- and
3.5-fold (compared to normal), respectively, 2 d after injury.
However, the levels of Th2 cytokines and the M2 macrophage
marker Arg I remained low after 6 d, indicating a tendency to-
ward a Th1-type response in the injury site. These results are
similar to previous findings in which microglial activation was
observed to peak within the lesion site 3–7 d postinjury (Popov-
ich et al., 1997; Batchelor et al., 2008) and a differentiation of M1
macrophages is favored (Kigerl et al., 2009). In contrast to the
transectionmodel, there is a remarkable second wave of immune
response after repair, in which a delayed but persistent induction

of Th2 cytokines was found. In addition, activated macrophages
of theM2 phenotype were prominent around the lesion sites and
graft areas in 10 d repaired spinal cords. A large number of M2
macrophages still dominated the graft areas in 14 d repaired spi-
nal cords. Together, this Th2 shift appears to be the result of
increasedTh2 cytokine secretion, and this, in turn, leads to anM2
macrophage response and corresponding increase in polyamine
levels in repaired spinal cords.
Previously, we proposed that aFGF may reduce neuronal cell
death and inflammation after spinal cord injury (Tsai et al.,
2008). In this study, we found that aFGF treatment induced Th2
cytokine IL-4 expression 10 d after repair and sequential upregu-
lation of the M2 marker Arg I. The regulation of IL-4 and IL-13
and their main sources in the body are not well defined. T cells
infiltrating the lesion site at 3–7 d may contribute to IL-4 expres-
sion (Popovich et al., 1997; Sroga et al., 2003; Donnelly and Pop-
ovich, 2008). Only two reports have shown that the combination
of aFGF with anti-CD3 stimulates FGF receptor-1-positive T cell
proliferation, but aFGF alone has no effect (Byrd et al., 1999,
2003). There have been no previous reports indicating that aFGF
regulates Th2 cytokine expression. Clearly, this mechanism re-
quires further elucidation.
Following spinal cord injury, the expression of BDNF mRNA
was reported to dramatically increase (Donnelly and Popovich,
2008), with microglia, macrophages, and monocytes likely con-
tributing to the expression of BDNFwithin the injury site (Batch-
elor et al., 1999; Dougherty et al., 2000; Ikeda et al., 2001;
Batchelor et al., 2002; Bouhy et al., 2006). After 7 d, BDNF levels
were reportedly lower, returning to normal levels (Ikeda et al.,
2001). Our findings demonstrate a different way to regulate the
expression of BDNF. Nerve grafts and full repair induced signif-
icantly higher levels of BDNF at 14 and 21 d, and BDNF was
mainly expressed by macrophages within grafted nerves. Previ-
ously, we found large numbers of activated macrophages in the
injury sites of repaired spinal cords after 10 d, and those numbers
remained high for 28 d (Lee et al., 2008). A portion of these
recruited macrophages are likely bone marrow-derived mono-
cytes infiltrating the injury site after 7 d (Popovich and Hickey,
2001). When monocyte-derived macrophages interact with pe-
ripheral nerves for 1 d, they express high levels of BDNF in vitro
(Shibata et al., 2003). It is difficult to distinguish resident micro-
glia from infiltrating monocytes. Thus, BDNF-expressing mac-
rophages in grafted nervesmay bemonocytes infiltrating after 7 d
or microglia andmonocytes that require time to migrate into the

grafted nerves, with unknown factors subsequently triggering
them to express BDNF.
aFGF and nerve grafts triggered the expression of several key
factors in the injury sites that can promote neuronal survival and
regeneration. First, increasing Th2 cytokine levels in repaired spi-
nal cords provides beneficial effects after injury. Adenoviral-
mediated IL-4 or IL-10 expression enhances the survival of
axotomized retinal ganglion cells through the inhibition of NO
synthesis (Koeberle et al., 2004). Th2 cells promote facial mo-
toneuron survival after facial nerve axotomy, but a reduced sur-
vival rate has been reported in IL-4 knock-outmice (Deboy et al.,
2006).More severe secondary inflammatory responses have been
reported in IL-10 knock-out mice, resulting in worse functional
recovery after spinal cord compression (Genovese et al., 2009).
Moreover, treatment of contused rat spinal cords with IL-10 re-
portedly improves motor function recovery (Bethea et al., 1999).
In addition to the known anti-inflammatory effects, IL-10 di-
rectly activates the PI3K/AKT pathway of cultured spinal cord
neurons andprovides a neuroprotective effect (Zhou et al., 2009).
Furthermore, the expression of IL-10 by infiltrating monocyte-
derived macrophages promotes the functional recovery of con-
tused spinal cords in mice (Shechter et al., 2009).
Polyamines are important for axon regeneration. Treatment
of cultured neurons with putrescine alone overcomes myelin-
associated inhibition (Cai et al., 2002). Treatment with poly-
amines also promotes axon regeneration in the peripheral nerves
(Gilad et al., 1996). Another in vivo study reports that spermidine
can promote optic nerve regeneration (Deng et al., 2009). After
spinal cord injury of rats, M1 macrophages predominate in sites
of trauma and exert neurotoxic effects, but the transientM2mac-
rophage response promotes repair and axonal growth (Kigerl et
al., 2009). Our in vitro studies revealed both coculture with M2
macrophages and treatment with spermidine combined with
BDNF promoted immunoreactivities of III in cortical neuron
cultures. We found that high levels of polyamines were synthe-
sized in repaired spinal cords and that spermines were detected in
M2macrophages within the grafted nerves. Macrophages and/or
monocytes infiltrating the injury sites after 6 d account for the
increase in polyamine expression from 10 to 14 d, and GAP-43
expression is very robust within the grafted nerves at the time Arg
I and polyamines are upregulated. Neuronal regeneration was
confirmed by neuron tracing results.We suggest that these axons
may grow from neurons in the stumps and from the supraspinal
centers. The collateral sprouting should increase the chances of
forming new relay circuits or activating local propriospinal neu-
rons to improve functional recovery. The inhibition of the poly-
amine biosynthesis pathway appears to attenuate the functional
recovery of repaired rats. Therefore, we speculate that poly-
amines released by these macrophages play a pivotal role in ax-
onal regeneration.
In summary, our results indicate that aFGF induces IL-4 ex-
pression and that nerve grafts induce NGF and BDNF expression
in transected spinal cords. A full repair strategy simultaneously
generates the beneficial effects of both aFGF and nerve grafts.
These findings imply that M2 macrophages expressing poly-
amines and BDNF play an important role in axonal regeneration.
