that new neurons are produced continuously from stem cells in
the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the dentate

Astrocytes act as neural stem cells and give rise to new neurons
in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus. Astrocytes in othergyrus of the hippocampus (Zhao et al., 2008). In most parts of
the central nervous system, however, neurons are not added in

erties after injury (Buffo et al., 2008). There are thus three distinctpopulation. We provide an integrated view of how

INTRODUCTION
A major challenge in developmental biology and regenerative
medicine is to understand the origin of cells. Once development
is completed, the number of cells in adult tissues can be main-
tained by duplication of differentiated cells or by the generation
of new cells from stem or progenitor cells. Most tissues are
composed of a variety of differentiated cells of different lineages
and it is poorly understood how their numbers are maintained in
adult tissues during homeostasis and in response to injury.
The adult central nervous system was considered a compara-
tively static tissue with little cell turnover. It is well established
alternative to cell transplantation.
Oligodendrocyte progenitors, ependymal cells, and astro-
cytes have all been suggested to act as neural stem cells in
the adult spinal cord (Horner et al., 2000; Johansson et al.,
1999; Martens et al., 2002; Meletis et al., 2008; Ohori et al.,
2006). Most studies have focused on the highly proliferative
oligodendrocyte progenitor population. Indirect data from viral
labeling of proliferating cells and lineage analysis from embry-
onic stages have led to the suggestion that oligodendrocyte
progenitors in the adult spinal cord have neural stem cell proper-
ties and produce cells of multiple lineages in vivo (Horky et al.,
2006; Ohori et al., 2006; Sellers et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2008a,
2008b), but this has not been addressed directly. Ependymal
cells give rise to differentiated progeny after injury and constitute
the main cell population in the intact spinal cord with in vitro
neural stem cell properties (Meletis et al., 2008), but the origin

SUMMARY
Several distinct cell types in the adult central nervous
system have been suggested to act as stem or prog-
enitor cells generating new cells under physiological
or pathological conditions. We have assessed the
origin of new cells in the adult mouse spinal cord by
genetic fate mapping. Oligodendrocyte progenitors
self-renew, give rise to newmature oligodendrocytes,
and constitute the dominating proliferating cell popu-
lation in the intact adult spinal cord. In contrast, astro-
cytes and ependymal cells, which are restricted to
limited self-duplication in the intact spinal cord,
generate the largest number of cells after spinal cord
injury. Only ependymal cells generate progeny of
multiple fates, andneural stemcell activity in the intact
and injured adult spinal cord is confined to this cell470 Cell Stem Cell 7, 470–482, October 8, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.Cell Stem Cell

with neural stem cell properties can be isolated from most
regions of the adult central nervous system, including, for
example, the spinal cord (Johansson et al., 1999; Shihabuddin
et al., 1997; Weiss et al., 1996).
Spinal cord injury is oftenmentioned among the first conditions
forwhich stemcellsmayprovide a new therapy. There are several
studies indicating that transplantation of neural stemcells or cells
derived from embryonic stem cells to the injured spinal cord have
a beneficial effect on functional recovery in experimental models,
although the mechanism is poorly understood (Barnabé-Heider
and Frisén, 2008). Improved functional recovery after transplan-
tationof in vitro expandedneural stemcells derived from theadult
spinal cord (Hofstetter et al., 2005) demonstrates that there are
stem cells in the adult spinal cord that can exert beneficial effects
after injury, but fail to do so efficiently under normal conditions.
Identification of stem and progenitor cells in the adult spinal
cord and an understanding of their response to injury could allow
the development of pharmacological strategies to modulate
these cells in situ to produce desired progeny after injury as an

Origin of New Cells in the Adult Spinal Cordcell populations in the adult spinal cord that have been sug-
gested to act as neural stem cells and to contribute to cell turn-
over. The relationship between these cell types, for example
whether they can give rise to each other, if they all have stem
cell properties, and their relative contribution to cell turnover in
the intact and injured spinal cord, had not been addressed.
We have in parallel performed genetic fate mapping of oligo-
dendrocyte progenitors, ependymal cells, and astrocytes in the
adult mouse spinal cord, allowing us to assess the relative roles
of these cell populations in cell turnover in the intact and injured
spinal cord. We present an integrated view of how differentiated
cells, progenitors, and stem cells cooperate in complementary
ways to generate new glial cells in the intact and injured adult
spinal cord.
RESULTS
Genetic Fate Mapping of the Main Proliferating Cell
Populations in the Uninjured Adult Spinal Cord
In order to assess cell turnover in the adult mouse spinal cord, we
first characterized which cell types proliferate. BrdU administra-
tion via the drinking water for 5 weeks resulted in labeled cells
scattered within all areas of the spinal cord (Figure 1A). Ependy-
mal cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte lineage cells together
accounted for the vast majority of BrdU-labeled cells (93.4% ±
2.7%, mean ± SD) (Figures 1B–1D). The remaining BrdU-labeled
cells are mainly microglia and blood vessel-associated cells
(Horner et al., 2000). The proportion of BrdU-labeled cells was
similar for Sox10+ oligodendrocyte lineage and ependymal
cells (4%–5%) but substantially lower for astrocytes (<1%)

+ +(Figure 1E). Oligodendrocyte lineage cells were identified by
the expression of Sox10, astrocytes by the expression of
Sox9, and ependymal cells by their position and expression of
Sox9 (Cahoy et al., 2008; Meletis et al., 2008; Pompolo and
Harley, 2001; Rivers et al., 2008). Oligodendrocyte progenitors
express NG2 and are also referred to as NG2 cells or polyden-
drocytes (Nishiyama et al., 2009). The few astrocytes that incor-
porated BrdU were most often located at the perimeter of the
spinal cord white matter (Figure 1C). There was a large variation
in proliferation rate within the oligodendroglial lineage, with
oligodendrocyte progenitors displaying a high proliferation rate
and mature oligodendrocytes being postmitotic (Figure 1E).
Oligodendrocyte lineage cells are by far the most numerous of
the proliferating cells and represent more than 80% of the
BrdU-labeled cells in the adult spinal cord (Figure 1F).
To trace the progeny of these proliferating cell populations, we
employed genetic fate mapping with three different transgenic
mouse lines expressing tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombinase
(CreER) under different cell type-specific promoters. We used
mice in which CreER expression was under the control of
promoters with specific expression in ependymal cells (FoxJ1),
astrocytes (Connexin 30), or oligodendrocyte lineage cells
(Olig2). These mice were on R26R Cre-reporter background,
which after tamoxifen administration leads to permanent and
heritable expression of the reporter gene b-galactosidase
(bgal) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The transgenic lines
and labeling paradigms are depicted in Figure S1 available
online. Tamoxifen was adminstered once daily for 5 days and
phenotypic characterization of the recombined cells was per-
formed 5 days later. The mice were 2–5 months old (Table S1).

 FoxJ1-CreER transgenic mice allow genetic recombination
specifically in ependymal cells in the adult spinal cord
(Figures 2A–2C; Meletis et al., 2008). The recombined ependy-
mal cells all have motile cilia and homogenously express, for
example, Sox9 and Vimentin (Figures 2A–2C; Meletis et al.,
2008). About 80% of ependymal cells are genetically marked
with the employed recombination strategy (Meletis et al.,
2008). There are GFAP+ astrocyte processes within the ependy-
mal layer and Olig2+ oligodendrocyte progenitors can be found
in close vicinity, but ependymal cells express none of these
markers and these cells are not recombined in FoxJ1-CreER
mice (Figures 2B and 2C; Meletis et al., 2008).

Origin of New Cells in the Adult Spinal Cordis restricted to astrocytes in the adult brain of Cx30-CreER trans-
genic mice (Slezak et al., 2007). In the spinal cord, recombination
in Cx30-CreER mice led to numerous labeled cells located
throughout the parenchyma (Figures 2D–2F). Almost all recom-
bined cells expressed Sox9 (99.5% ± 0.4%, mean ± SD) and
GFAP (93.9% ± 2.4%, mean ± SD), a small subset located in
the white matter expressed Vimentin, and the recombined cells
were never found in the ependymal layer (Figures 2E and 2F; Fig-
ure S2A). Sox9-expressing cells in the parenchyma coexpressed
the astrocytic markers GFAP and S100b, but never the oligoden-
drocyte lineagemarkersSox10,NG2,orPDGFRa (FigureS2). The
genetic labeling of astrocytes was efficient, with 74.7% ± 2.9%
(mean ± SD) of parenchymal Sox9+ cells being recombined.
Based on morphology and marker expression, we could
identify three astrocytic subtypes that were recombined in

Cell Stem Cell
Origin of New Cells in the Adult Spinal CordS2A–S2C). We classified these cells as astrocytes, rather than
oligodendrocyte lineage cells, based on the expression of the
astrocytic markers GFAP and Sox9, the protoplasmatic astro-
cyte morphology, and the lack of the oligodendrocyte lineage
markers Sox10 and NG2 (Figure 2F; Figure S2A).
Olig2 is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors and mature
oligodendrocytes in the adult spinal cord (Ohori et al., 2006;
Yamamoto et al., 2001), and recombination has been demon-
strated in these cell types in Olig2-CreER transgenic mice during
development (Masahira et al., 2006; Takebayashi et al., 2002).We
found Olig2-CreER recombined cells scattered within both the
white and gray matter in the adult spinal cord (Figure 2G). Almost
all recombined cells expressed Olig2 and Sox10 and a quarter of
them were mature APC+ oligodendrocytes (Figure 2I). The
recombination efficiency was lower in this line than the other
two with 4.5% ± 0.1% (mean ± SD) of Sox10+ cells (all matura-
tional stages in the oligodendrocyte lineage) being recombined.
Importantly, whereas recombination was inefficient in mature
oligodendrocytes, it was more efficient in oligodendrocyte
progenitors, with 38% ± 14% (mean ± SD) of NG2+ cells being
recombined. About two thirds of recombined cells were prolifer-
ating oligodendrocyte progenitors expressing NG2 and 23.5% ±
9.5% (mean ± SD, 3- to 5-month-old mice) of recombined cells
had undergone division and were labeled with BrdU after
5 days administration in the drinking water (Figures 2H and 2I;
Figure S2D). A very small fraction (0.9% ± 0.7%, mean ± SD) of
Crecombined cells in the Olig2-CreER line were Olig2+ graymatter
astrocytes expressingSox9 andGFAP. This corresponds to<1%
of gray matter astrocytes. The very inefficient recombination in
Olig2+ astrocytes was fortuitous for the purpose of this study
because it allowed us to distinguish the astrocyte and oligoden-
drocyte lineages in the Olig2-CreER and Cx30-CreER lines
(Figure S2E).

tamoxifen-induced recombination (Figure S1B, Table S1). The
total number of recombined cells did not change significantly
in the FoxJ1-CreER or Cx30-CreER lines over time (Figure 3A).
The phenotype of the recombined cells at 4months in both these
lines was indistinguishable from that at 5 days after recombina-
tion (Figure S3), with all cells being ependymal cells in the FoxJ1-
CreER line and all cells being astrocytes in the Cx30-CreER line.
Thus, ependymal cells and astrocytes do not produce progeny
of other fates in the uninjured spinal cord and their number stays
constant, indicating that their proliferation serves to compensate
for some cell loss to maintain the size of their cell populations.
In contrast, the Olig2-CreER line showed a significant increase
in the total number of recombined cells after 4 months. This
increase was due to a larger number of labeled mature oligoden-
drocytes (APC+) whereas the number of labeled progenitors
(NG2+) was largely unaltered (Figure 3A; Figure S3). The finding
that the number of oligodendrocyte progenitors stayed constant
indicates that these cells both self-renew and produce new
mature oligodendrocytes. Mature oligodendrocytes are postmi-
totic but can be replenished from progenitor cells (Keirstead and
Blakemore, 1997). To assess the potential addition of mature
oligodendrocytes in an independent way, wild-type mice
received BrdU in the drinking water for 5 weeks and were
analyzed either at that time (5w) or after another 7 weeks after
the end of BrdU administration (5w+7w). There was a significant
ell Stem Cell 7, 470–482, October 8, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc. 473
increase with time in the proportion of BrdU-labeled mature
oligodendrocytes, increasing from 17% ± 2.7% (mean ± SD)
after 5 weeks of BrdU administration to 51% ± 1.2% (mean ±
SD) of all BrdU-labeled cells 7 weeks later (Figures 3B and 3C).
Moreover, direct counts of APC+ cells, independently of BrdU
labeling, revealed a significant increase with time in the same
animals (p < 0.05, Student’s t test).
Thus, in the uninjured adult spinal cord ependymal cells and
astrocytes proliferate to maintain their population sizes whereas
oligodendrocyte progenitors both self-renew and generate an
increasing number of mature oligodendrocytes.
In Vitro Neural Stem Cell Potential in the Intact and
Injured Spinal Cord Is Confined to Ependymal Cells
We assessed the expression of markers associated with neural
stem/progenitor cells in ependymal cells, astrocytes, and oligo-
dendrocyte lineage cells in the adult spinal cord. Sox2 is ex-
pressed by the vast majority, if not all, recombined cells in the
FoxJ1-CreER and Cx30-CreER lines and in a subset of cells in
the Olig2-CreER line. Musashi1 is highest expressed in ependy-
mal cells, and CD133/prominin expression as well as Nestin
second intron enhancer activity, both associated with neural
stem cells (Carlén et al., 2006; Corti et al., 2007), are exclusive
to ependymal cells in the adult spinal cord (Figures S4A–S4E).
The adult spinal cord contains cells with in vitro neural stem
cell potential (Johansson et al., 1999; Shihabuddin et al., 1997;
Weiss et al., 1996), and genetic fate mapping has established
that they are ependymal cells (Meletis et al., 2008). Spinal cord
injury results in an increased number of neural stem cells in the
rat (Moreno-Manzano et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2006), but their origin
was unknown. It is possible, as in the cerebral cortex (Buffo et al.,
2008), that injury recruits cells that lack stem cell potential in the
uninjured situation to gain such potential.
We first characterized the effect of a transverse dorsal funic-
ulus incision at Th4, not reaching down to the gray matter or
central canal, in adult wild-type mice on neurosphere formation.
Neurospheres appeared faster, were larger, and 3–4 times more
numerous after injury (Figures 4A and 4B). Injury-induced neuro-
spheres displayed self-renewal and multipotency, as shown by
the fact that they could be serially passaged and, when exposed
to differentiating conditions, generated astrocytes, oligodendro-
cytes, and neurons at the clonal level (Figure 4A and see further
below).
To determine the cell type of origin of injury-induced neuro-
spheres, we established neurosphere cultures from FoxJ1-
CreER, Cx30-CreER, andOlig2-CreERmice onR26R-YFP back-
ground (Figure 4C). Recombination was induced by five daily
tamoxifen injections. After 5 additional days, to ensure that
tamoxifen had been eliminated and no further recombination
could take place (Meletis et al., 2008; Robinson et al., 1991),
cultures were either established directly or animals were sub-
jected to a spinal cord injury and cultures initiated 3 days after
the injury (Figure S1C). Efficient recombination in each animalwas verified histologically in a spinal cord segment adjacent to
the lesion (Figure 4C). Approximately 80% of neurospheres
from FoxJ1-CreER mice were recombined, both in cultures
deriving from uninjured and injured animals, establishing that
most neurospheres derive from ependymal cells in both situa-
tions. Recombination is never complete, which results in an
474 Cell Stem Cell 7, 470–482, October 8, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.underestimation of the actual contribution. The recombination
rate in ependymal cells and in neurospheres from FoxJ1-CreER
mice is similar, suggesting that close to all neurospheres derive
from ependymal cells. This is further supported by the finding
that when ependymal cells were isolated by flow cytometry, no
neurosphere-initiating activity was found in the nonependymal
fraction (Meletis et al., 2008). In contrast, we only found one
single recombined neurosphere in each condition in cultures
from the Cx30-CreER line and not a single recombined neuro-
sphere in any condition in cultures from the Olig2-CreER line
even if the primary cultures were kept for a long time (Figures
4D and 4E).
Restricted progenitor cells have been shown to give rise to
primary neurospheres with limited self-renewal and/or differenti-
ation potential (Reynolds and Rietze, 2005; Wu et al., 2005). To
assess self-renewal capacity and multipotency at the clonal
level, single recombined neurospheres were collected and
passaged. The two Cx30-CreER-derived recombined neuro-
spheres did not generate secondary neurospheres, whereas
FoxJ1-CreER-derived recombined neurospheres expressed
markers associated with neural stem cells and displayed self-
renewal during serial passages as well as multipotency as they
gave rise to the three main neural cell types after induction of
differentiation (Figures S4F–S4I). Thus, ependymal cells consti-
tute the main neural stem cell population in the spinal cord and
their neurosphere-forming potential is enhanced after injury,
whereas astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors do not
demonstrate in vitro stem cell properties, at least under the stan-
dard conditions employed here.
Ependymal Cells, Astrocytes, and Oligodendrocyte
Progenitors Produce Progeny that Occupy
Complementary Domains after Spinal Cord Injury
To characterize the in vivo response of ependymal cells, astro-
cytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors to spinal cord injury, an
incision in the dorsal funiculus was made in adult FoxJ1-CreER,
Cx30-CreER, and Olig2-CreER mice 5 days after completion of
tamoxifen administration (Figure S1D, Table S1). The 5 day
clearing period allows elimination of tamoxifen, precluding
potentially altered promoter activity in response to injury to result
in recombination in other cell types (Meletis et al., 2008;Robinson
et al., 1991).Control animals not receiving tamoxifendid not show
recombination after injury (data not shown).
Quantification of the total number of recombined cells in the
three transgenic lines showed a significant increase at the injury
site compared to an adjacent segment (Figure 5A; Figure S5A,
Table S1). The number of recombined cells at the injury
increased 4- to 5-fold in the FoxJ1-CreER line and approximately
2-fold in the Cx30-CreER and Olig2-CreER lines. This increase
was established already at 2 weeks after the injury and was
maintained at almost the same level after 4 months (Figure 5A).
Approximately 80% of FoxJ1-CreER, Cx30-CreER, and Olig2-
CreER recombined cells at the injury were labeled with BrdU

found scattered in the spared parenchyma (Figures 5B and 5C;
Figures S5B and S5C; Meletis et al., 2008). Astrocytic progeny
in spinal cord-injured Cx30-CreER mice also accumulated at
the lesion site, but in a complementary domain to the ependy-
mal-derived cells. Whereas ependymal progeny mainly occu-
pied the center of the lesion site, new astrocyte-derived cells
were most numerous in the perimeter of the forming scar tissue
(Figures 5B and 5C; Figures S5B and S5C). Oligodendrocyte
progenitor progeny was increased throughout the injured
segment, with cells present at the injury site but in similar
numbers also in areas of the segment that had not been directly
affected by the lesion (Figures 5B and 5C; Figures S5B and S5C).
All three lines gave rise to progeny within the glial scar, but only

In order to assess the phenotype of the progeny of ependymal
cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors, we charac-
terized the marker profile of recombined cells 2 weeks and
4 months after injury in FoxJ1-CreER, Cx30-CreER, and Olig2-
CreER mice. No apparent difference in the number of recom-
bined cells was observed in segments adjacent to the injury
compared to uninjured animals (Figures 2 and 6A; Figures S3
and S6A), indicating that the reaction to injury is largely restricted
to the lesion site.

NeuN+ neurons in the injured segment at both 2 weeks and

generated after this type of spinal cord injury.

downregulated FoxJ1-CreER transgene expression (Figures

and a subpopulation of themwas also GFAP+. Four months after

to a reduced production of progeny by oligodendrocyte lineage

located in the center of the scar tissue, whereas astrocyte dupli-

renewal. We found that ependymal cell and astrocyte prolifera-
tion is restricted to self-duplication to maintain their populations
in the uninjured spinal cord, whereas oligodendrocyte progeni-
tors self-renew and give rise to an increasing number of mature
oligodendrocytes. Injury recruits ependymal cells, astrocytes,
and oligodendrocyte progenitors to generate progeny in comple-
mentary domains during scar formation and remyelination. Only
ependymal cells show multilineage potential and stem cell
activity is contained within the ependymal cell population in
both the intact and injured spinal cord. We provide an integrated
view of how several cell types have distinct and complementary
roles in homeostasis and in the response to injury.
Stem, Progenitor, and Differentiated Cells Make New
Glial Cells after Injury
There is a large difference in the proliferative activity of astro-
cytes, ependymal cells, and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the
uninjured spinal cord. Ependymal cells incorporate BrdU
approximately ten times more frequently than do astrocytes,
and oligodendrocyte progenitors incorporate BrdU approxi-
mately ten times more frequently than do ependymal cells
(Figure 1E). In contrast to the relative quiescence of ependymal
cells and astrocytes in the uninjured situation, both populations
produce a larger number of progeny than do the oligodendrocyte
progenitors after injury. This is in spite of a doubling of the
production of progeny by oligodendrocyte progenitors.
Astrocytes in the adult spinal cord give rise to new cells of the
same fate, although to very different extents in the intact or
injured situation, and appear as differentiated cells with a latent
but extensive self-duplication capacity. Neural stem cells in the
adult lateral ventricle wall, which give rise to olfactory bulb inter-
neurons, have astrocytic features (Zhao et al., 2008), and the
majority of neurospheres from this region are recombined in
Cx30-CreER mice (our unpublished data). We did not find
evidence for in vitro neural stem cell properties or in vivo multili-
neage potential of adult spinal cord astrocytes. As in the spinal
cord, cortical astrocytes do not generate cells of other fates in
the intact or injured situation. However, cortical astrocytes can
give rise to neurospheres after injury (Buffo et al., 2008). There
is thus considerable heterogeneity with regard to stem cell prop-
erties between astrocytes in different parts of the adult central
nervous system.
Previous work suggested that adult spinal cord oligodendro-
cyte progenitors generate astrocytes (Horky et al., 2006; Ohori
et al., 2006; Sellers et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2008a, 2008b), but
our genetic lineage analysis does not support this. Our results
rather indicate that spinal cord oligodendrocyte progenitors
are similar to those in the forebrain, which recently have been
demonstrated by similar genetic fate mapping strategies to
give rise to new oligodendrocytes but not astrocytes (Dimou
et al., 2008; Rivers et al., 2008). We failed to find evidence for
multilineage potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, so
they are, in spite of their extensive self-renewal capacity, better
Cell Stem Cell
Origin of New Cells in the Adult Spinal Corddefined as progenitor cells than stem cells.
The limited proliferation of ependymal cells in the uninjured
situation, together with the large increase in their production of
progeny after injury, describes a quiescent stem cell population
that can be recruited on demand after injury. Forebrain ependy-
mal cells lining the lateral ventricles similarly only after injury give
Crise to other cell types (Carlén et al., 2009). Although the produc-
tion of progeny by stem cells is increased after injury in many
tissues, it is unusual that a stem cell population does not partake
in any cell replacement in the uninjured situation. However,
several previous studies support that the response of a tissue
to an injury may differ from simply modulating the activity of
the stem or progenitor cells that maintain homeostasis in the
intact tissue (Dor et al., 2004; Dor and Melton, 2008; Ito et al.,
2005; Levy et al., 2005; Nakagawa et al., 2007; Simon and Frisén,
2007; Xu et al., 2008).
Remyelination and Scar Formation in the Injured
Spinal Cord
Spinal cord injury results in rapid loss of oligodendrocytes
(Crowe et al., 1997; Grossman et al., 2001; Lytle and Wrathall,
2007), leaving many axons partly denuded and unable to effi-
ciently propagate impulses. In partial spinal cord lesions, which
are most common in humans, a substantial part of the neurolog-
ical dysfunction is thought to be secondary to the loss of oligo-
dendrocytes (McDonald and Belegu, 2006). Demyelination also
results in rearrangement of axonal ion channels, which further
may impair propagation of action potentials (Nashmi and
Fehlings, 2001). Demyelinated axons are vulnerable to degener-
ation, and rapid remyelination is important not only to regain
conductance but also to avoid further neurodegeneration
(Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008). Both oligodendrocyte
progenitors and ependymal cells have previously been demon-
strated to generate myelinating oligodendrocytes (Dimou et al.,
2008; Meletis et al., 2008; Rivers et al., 2008). We show here
that the vast majority of new oligodendrocytes in the injured
spinal cord derive from oligodendrocyte progenitors and
a smaller fraction from ependymal cells. The beneficial effects
of transplantation of myelinating cells after spinal cord injury in
animal models (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008) indicate
that the replacement of oligodendrocytes from endogenous cells
is incomplete or too slow to be fully efficient.
Astrocytes are the dominating glial cells in the scar that forms
at the injury, and chondrotin sulfate proteoglycans in the scar
inhibit axonal regrowth, indicating that astrocytes prevent axonal
regeneration (Busch and Silver, 2007; Silver and Miller, 2004).
However, astrocytes shield the intact tissue from further damage
and limit the infiltration of inflammatory cells and further demye-
lination (Faulkner et al., 2004; Okada et al., 2006). Thus, the large
number of astrocytes at the injury site appears important to limit
and restrain the inflammatory response, but this may be at the
expense of axonal regrowth. We demonstrate two different
cellular origins of new astrocytes after spinal cord injury, preex-
isting astrocytes and ependymal cells. These new astrocytes
differ with regard to phenotype and distribution. Most ependy-
mal cell-derived astrocytes are GFAP negative but express other
markers and ultrastructural characteristics of astrocytes (Meletis
et al., 2008). The ependymal cell-derived astrocytes form the
core of the glial scar and the astrocytes at the periphery of thescar arise by astrocyte duplication.
Potential Strategies to Modulate Endogenous Neural
Stem and Progenitor Cells for Spinal Cord Repair

characterization of murine neural stem/progenitor cells based on Prominin-1experimental models (Hofstetter et al., 2005). The presence of
resident cells in the adult spinal cord capable to promote func-
tional recovery is encouraging for the prospect of developing
pharmacological strategies to modulate endogenous spinal
cord stem cells in situ.
A goal for strategies aiming at promoting repair by endoge-
nous spinal cord stem cells is to promote the generation of oligo-
dendrocytes. Although ependymal cells generate considerably
fewer oligodendrocytes than the oligodendrocyte progenitors
after spinal cord injury, they give rise to a larger total number
of progeny. Most ependymal progeny become astrocytes and
contribute to scar formation. It appears attractive to direct the
differentiation of ependymal cell progeny from the astrocytic to
the oligodendrocyte lineage. This could potentially result in
both reduced scar formation and improved remyelination. That
ependymal cell-derived oligodendrocytes indeed may promote
functional recovery is supported by the fact that ependymal cells
are the origin of the in vitro expanded neural stem cells that
improve function after transplantation in animal models of spinal
cord injury, and that this effect was augmented when such cells
were manipulated to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation
(Hofstetter et al., 2005). The rapidly increasing knowledge on
cell fate specification during embryogenesis and in adult line-
ages will aid in the development of experimental strategies to
modulate endogenous stem and progenitor cells for spinal
cord repair.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Transgenic Mice
FoxJ1-CreER (Meletis et al., 2008), Cx30-CreER (Slezak et al., 2007), and
Olig2-CreER (Takebayashi et al., 2002) mice on R26R-bgalactosidase or
yellow fluorescent protein Cre-reporter background (Soriano, 1999; Srinivas
et al., 2001) backcrossed to C57/Bl6 were studied in adult stages (Table S1).
Heterozygous Olig2-CreER mice, which appear normal (Masahira et al.,
2006; Takebayashi et al., 2002), were used. Recombination was induced
by 5 daily intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg tamoxifen (Sigma, 20 mg/ml in
corn oil).
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 4% formaldehyde in
PBS and spinal cords were postfixed overnight at 4C and then cryoprotected
in 30%sucrose. All antibodies used are specified in the Supplemental Informa-
tion. Cell nuclei were visualized with DAPI (1 mg/mL, Sigma). Control sections
were stainedwith secondary antibody alone. Images show one focal plane and
the Z-projection of stacks.
Neural Stem Cell Cultures
Spinal cord cells were dissociated and neurosphere cultures were established
as described (Meletis et al., 2008). All cells isolated from one spinal cord were
plated in 10 cm cultures dishes. Single recombined neurospheres were picked
manually, dissociated, and plated in one well of a 96-well plate. Clonally
derived secondary neurospheres were collected and split into two: one half
was used for continuous passaging and subsequent neural stem cell differen-
tiation whereas the other half was used for plating in differentiating conditions
(poly-D-lysine-coated slides with growth factor free medium supplemented by
1%FCS). After 2 weeks in differentiation condition, immunocytochemistry wasperformed as described above with antibodies described in the Supplemental
Information.
Spinal Cord Injury and BrdU Labeling
Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin and the dorsal funiculus was cut
transversely without reaching the gray matter or central canal at Th4 and

was administered in the drinkingwater or administered twice by intraperitoneal
injections (12 mg/ml, 100 ml per injection) at 6 hr interval, followed by BrdU
administration in the drinking water (5 days).
