Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is induced by a variety
of damages such as trauma, ischemia, and iatrogenic injury,
resulting in sense and motion dysfunction. Despite the
improvements in medical and surgical care, current treat-
ment methods for SCI demonstrate poor and delayed effi-
ciency, leading to different degree of permanent loss of
neural function and disability in the patients. Rapid
advances in stem-cells research suggest that stem cells may
be applied in SCI therapy. Indeed, SCI is a major field in
which stem-cell therapy has been proposed and practised,
and most recently the clinical trials of stem-cell therapy
were initiated, which aroused a number of clinical con-
cerns. In this review, we summarize current status of SCI
repair, then introduce the sources and biological charac-
teristics of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and
discuss the differentiation potential of iPSCs and the per-
spective of the application of iPSCs in SCI therapy.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common disease in clinical
practice. SCI can be induced by a variety of damages such
as trauma, ischemia, and iatrogenic injury, resulting in the
dysfunction of sense and motion under damaged plane or
bowel and bladder. Despite the improvements in medical
and surgical care, current treatment methods for SCI
demonstrate poor and delayed efficiency, leading to dif-
ferent degree of permanent loss of neural function and high
disability rate in the patients. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop novel therapy strategies that would
improve the outcome after SCI. The pathogenesis of SCI is
a complex process that involves an initial mechanical insult
followed by a cascade of cellular and molecular events that
constitute the secondary injury such as glutamatergic
excitotoxicity, free radical generation, lipid peroxidation,
inflammation, and ischemia that ultimately result in
necrosis or apoptosis [1]. Based on these pathological
events of SCI, several approaches have been proposed for
SCI repair: (1) to minimize progressive cell death, (2) to
replace lost cells by transplantation or to stimulate the
injured cord to produce new cells, a process called neu-
rogenesis, (3) to reconnect injured nerve fibers with their
original targets or with substitute targets (axon regenera-
tion and sprouting), (4) to maximize the function of spared
pathways by altering connectivity (synaptic plasticity), (5)
to maximize the function of spared nerve fibers by
repairing their myelin sheath (re-myelination), (6) to
rehabilitate muscle and function, and (7) to use prostheses,
robotics or other technologies to restore function [2].
Rapid advances in stem-cells research in recent years
suggest that stem cells may be applied in many or even all of
the above proposed approaches for SCI therapy. Indeed, SCI
is a major field in which stem-cell therapy has been proposed
and practised, and most recently the clinical trials of stem-
cell therapy were initiated, which aroused a number of
clinical concerns [3]. In this review, we summarized current
status of SCI repair, then introduced the sources and bio-
logical characteristics of induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs), and discussed the differentiation potential of iPSCs
and the perspective of the application of iPSCs in SCI repair.

Current status of SCI repair
SCI includes primary injury and secondary injury, the
former refers to the irreversible damage caused by direct
mechanical insult, while the latter refers to the damage
caused by secondary injuries of trauma such as traumatic
inflammation/immune response, secondary cell necrosis
and/or apoptosis, excitotoxin, intracellular and extracellu-
lar ionic imbalance, oxygen free radical, lipid peroxide and
axon reaction [4]. In the earlier stage of injury, spinal cord
swells and bleeds, followed by spinal cord ischemia which
leads to necrosis of diseased region. The early acute phase
(2–48 h) is characterized by inflammation, free radicals
production, ion imbalance, immune-related neuron toxicity
and other secondary responses, thus neuroprotective inter-
vention is of great significance during this period. The
subacute stage (48 h–2 weeks) is characterized by signifi-
cant phagocytosis, in which a huge number of necrotic
cells and tissue fragments are engulfed to create a favorable
microenvironment for axonal regeneration and other reac-
tions and this period is the window stage of transplantation
[5]. The distinct features of intermediate phase are glial
scar formation and axonal regeneration [6]. Finally, during
the chronic phase syringomyelia and/or fistula gradually
form, which indicates that the SCI enters into stable
stage [5].
The difficulty for SCI repair is that nerve and neuroglia
cells are destroyed due to necrosis and/or apoptosis, and
nearby undamaged neurons could not effectively supple-
ment due to limited regeneration potency. On the other
hand, changes in local microenvironment lead to imbalance
of the proliferation of glial cells, such as insufficient pro-
liferation of oligodendrocytes which produce and form
axonal myelin sheath, and hyperplasia of astrocytes and
microglia, which prevents axon regeneration and the
reconstruction of synaptic connections as well as function
recovery [7].
SCI repair methods include surgery, medicine therapy
and biological therapy. Surgical decompression in early
stage of SCI (\24 h) and the reconstruction of spinal sta-
bility have been suggested to be favorable for SCI repair
[8, 9]. Most of the medicines commonly used to treat SCI
are still under clinical trials such as corticosteroids, min-
ocycline, erythropoietin and gangliosides, which are
effective in acute stage of SCI by reducing SCI secondary
injury and protecting the remaining nerve tissue [10–12].
However, surgery and medicine treatment methods are not
satisfactory for SCI repair because the damaged/lost neu-
rons and axons whose remyelination is impaired cannot be
replenished and synaptic connections cannot be rebuilt.
With the development of biotechnology, biological
therapy represented by cell transplantation has shown
promise for SCI repair. It has been reported that in mouse
models SCI could be treated by transplantation of Schwann
cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, neural stem cells, mes-
enchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and
iPSCs [13–16]. These transplantation methods indeed have
certain therapeutic effects, but exhibit some shortages.
Schwann cell transplantation can promote nerve regenera-
tion by generating matrix, secreting neurotrophic factors,
and improving local microenvironment, but the lost nerve
cells cannot be replenished due to the limited distance of
Schwann cell migration. Furthermore, Schwann cells,
which are difficult to amplify, can only be sampled by
invasive methods which may cause neurological deficits in
donor sites, thus limiting their application [17]. Olfactory
ensheathing cell transplantation also faces the similar
problems [18]. The application of neural stem cells is also
restricted due to limited source from specific sites, the
difficulty in being sampled, and host immune rejection
[19]. Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) cells are
immune naı̈ve and they show the therapeutic potential as a
safe, feasible and effective cellular source for transplanta-
tion in SCI [20]. However, clinical studies with hUCB cells
are still rare due to the concerns about their safety and
efficiency. Recent utilization of adipose-derived stem cells
and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells help overcome
the problems of limited source and ethical issues, but these
stem cells are not homogenous, and further technical
improvement is required to purify and amplify them [21].
In contrast, iPSCs have many advantages that cannot be
matched by other stem cells, such as multi-differentiation
potential, abundant source, easily being sampled, no host
immune rejection, and no ethical or legal issues.
The sources and biological characteristics of iPSCs
iPSCs are developed from differentiated cells by the
expression of specific transcription factors which are reg-
ulated by direct reprograming techniques. The first iPSCs
were created by retrovirus-mediated transfer of Oct3/4,
Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc genes into mouse fibroblast cells
[22]. Currently, a variety of methods have been developed
to derive iPSCs (summarized in Table 1): (a) viral trans-
duction: IPSCs can be successfully induced by the intro-
duction of different amounts/types of transcription factors
using several types of virus [23–26], but exogenous genes
of these viruses are prone to integrate with host genes and
increase the risk of tumorigenesis; (b) plasmid transfection:
although exogenous genes might integrate with host genes
during plasmid transfection, the probability is much
smaller than using retrovirus, thus plasmid transfection is
relatively safe [27, 28]; (c) episomal vector: transcription
factors are transfected into adult cells using episomal
vector and then the episomal vector is removed, thus
12 Neurol Sci (2013) 34:11–17
123
avoiding the integration of exogenous genes [29];
(d) translocation system: transcription factors are trans-
ferred into cell using piggyback translocation system, the
transposons (carrying transcription factor genes) are
removed by translocase after the induction of iPSCs
through re-programing, then iPSCs without the integration
of exogenous genes are successfully prepared [30–32];
(e) recombinant protein: adult cells can be reprogramed by
transcription factor genes encoded proteins (reprograming
protein) to develop into iPSCs [33, 34]. This approach is
much safer than virus or plasmid mediated gene transfer,
but the efficiency is greatly reduced; (f) chemical method:
several groups have successfully got iPSCs using ‘‘cock-
tail’’ which involves chemical substances and transcription
factors [35–37]; (g) RNA: iPSCs can also be induced using
miRNA [38–40]. This approach avoids the transfer of the
genes encoding the above-mentioned transcription factors
and is an ideal method of preparing iPSCs because it is
more efficient and secure. However, the productivity is still
low. We expect that with the continued revolution of iPS
technology, efficient and safe methods of preparing iPSCs
will be available in the near future [41].
Pluripotency is one of the main characteristics of iPSCs,
indicating the potency to develop into three germ layers and
differentiate into all types of cells. Initial studies have shown
that iPSCs are similar to ESCs in many aspects such as
morphology, proliferation, expression of ESCs marker genes
and teratoma formation [22]. Another feature of iPSCs is that
they come from the recipient, thus avoid the ethical and legal
issues raised from ESCs in clinical application. In addition,

iPSCs have several advantages such as wide source, large
quantity, and being easily obtained.
Neuron differentiation potential of iPSCs
iPSCs can be induced to differentiate into neurons, and
these neurons indeed have the corresponding physiological
functions. iPSCs have been shown to differentiate into
dopaminergic neurons which could improve the Parkin-
son’s symptoms after being transplanted into rat models of
Parkinson’s disease [42]. Dimos et al. [43] reprogramed the
fibroblasts of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients into
iPSCs, which then differentiated into neural cells after
being treated with SHH agonist and RA. Ebert et al. [44]
reprogramed the fibroblasts of a child with spinal muscular
atrophy into iPSCs and found that neural cells differenti-
ated from these iPSCs exhibited the genotypes and phe-
notypes of spinal muscular atrophy, suggesting that IPSCs
have broad application in disease modeling and drug
screening. Karumbayaram et al. [45] induced iPSCs to
differentiate into motor neurons and demonstrated their
electrophysiological properties for the first time.
IPSCs and SCI repair
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts-induced pluripotent stem
cells-secondary neurospheres (MEF-IPSCs-SNSs) were
shown to produce functional neurons, astrocytes, and oli-
godendrocytes in vitro. Furthermore, when these neuro-
spheres were transplanted into the spinal cord 9 day after
contusive injury, they differentiated into all three neural
lineages without forming teratomas and participated in
remyelination and induced the axonal regrowth of host
5HT? serotonergic fibers, resulting in locomotor function
recovery (Fig. 1) [16]. It has been proposed that the ther-
apeutic effects of iPSCs transplantation for SCI are related
to the following mechanisms: reconstructing neural syn-
aptic connections by neural cells derived from the trans-
planted cells, the remyelination of demyelinated axons by
oligodendrocytes, and neurotrophic factors secreted by
neural cells derived from the transplanted cells [16]. Fur-
thermore, when human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-
derived neurospheres (hiPSC-NSs) were transplanted into
nonobese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodefi-
cient (SCID) mice, the grafted hiPSC-NSs survived,
migrated, and differentiated into the three major neural
lineages within the injured spinal cord. In addition, both
cell-autonomous and noncell-autonomous effects were
observed, including synapse formation between hiPSC-NS-
derived neurons and host mouse neurons, the expression of
neurotrophic factors, angiogenesis, axonal regrowth, and
increased amounts of myelin in the injured area. Conse-
quently, significantly better functional recovery was
observed which persisted through the end of the observa-
tion period 112 day post-SCI [46]. Taken together, these
results provide strong evidence that treating SCI with
iPSCs transplantation could improve or even restore the
impaired function in mice.
However, to promote the application of iPSCs in the
clinic for SCI therapy, several issues should be addressed.
First is the efficiency of obtaining iPSCs. iPSCs can be
derived using the above-mentioned methods, although the
quantity and quality of the derived iPSCs are different. Up
to now the efficiency of obtaining iPSCs is low, ranging
from 0.001 to 10 % [27, 39]. Given the huge need of iPSCs
in clinical practice, the clinical application of iPSCs will
undoubtedly be restricted by low efficiency of obtaining
them. Second is the selection of source cells for iPSCs. The
efficiency and safety of iPSCs derived from different tissues
are not exactly the same. Therefore, it is important to select
appropriate source cells. Third is the immunological
response induced by iPSCs. In early period, it was believed
that iPSCs could avoid immune rejection of cell trans-
plantation, but further experiments have shown that iPSCs
have immunogenicity [47]. If immune response is induced
by transplanted iPSCs, the host’s immune system will attack
transplanted cells, which may lead to the failure of trans-
plantation. Fourth is the safety of iPSCs. It is known that
transplantation of undifferentiated iPSCs may cause the
formation of teratoma [48]. Although flow cytometry
allows the selection of differentiated iPSCs and the exclu-
sion of undifferentiated iPSCs, thus avoiding the formation
of teratomas after transplantation, this method is not feasi-
ble in the clinic due to the huge need of iPSCs. In addition,
DNA methylation and phenotypic analysis have shown that
iPSCs are not exactly the same as ESCs and traditional
virus-mediated gene transfer has the risk of exogenous gene
integration [49]. All of these account for the safety issues of
iPSCs. Fifth is the clinical application of iPSCs in SCI
repair. No study has investigated the appropriate quantity of
implanted iPSCs to achieve the best therapeutic effects
because too little or too much implanted iPSCs cells will
cause the failure of cell transplantation therapy. In addition,
hyperalgesia symptoms may occur which might be related
to functional disorder caused by abnormal conduction
pathway formed after stem-cell transplantation [5]. Further
studies are necessary to optimize iPSCs transplantation
strategy to avoid similar complications.
Perspectives for iPSCs in SCI therapy
ES cells transplantation has been approved by FDA for
phase I clinical trials of SCI therapy [50]. Given that
14 Neurol Sci (2013) 34:11–17
123
iPSCs have many advantages compared to ES cells, we
can expect the clinical application of iPSCs in SCI
therapy in the near future provided that the pitfalls of
iPSCs are addressed. Interestingly, it was reported very
recently that the fibroblasts could be directly repro-
gramed into neural cells and liver cells [51–53], sug-
gesting that the intermediate state of iPSCs could be
bypassed (Fig. 2). Does this mean that future IPSCs
treatment of SCI will be changed? Somatic cells can be
induced directly to trans-differentiate into target cells
such as neural cells and glial cells without reversing to
IPSCs, thus the oncogenic risk of iPSCs can be avoided
in clinical application. Although this method has the
problem of low conversion rate, it undoubtedly brings the
breakthrough in the application of stem-cell transplanta-
tion for SCI therapy. Recently, Son et al. [54] directly
converted mouse and human fibroblasts into induced
motor neurons by defined factors and these neurons
exhibited engraftment capacity and could be differenti-
ated into functional neural subtypes in vivo. This study
lays the experimental foundation for further investiga-
tions on the transplantation of these converted neurons
for SCI treatment. However, it is important to note that
stem-cell transplantation has been shown to work rela-
tively less by direct cell replacement, and the induction
of tissue repair by local progenitors appears more effi-
cient. Although the direct reprograming technology
undoubtedly brings a new approach to SCI therapy,
further optimization of the strategy for the large-scale
preparation of clinical-grade and patient-specific trans-
plantable iPSCs should pave the way for the application
of iPSCs to SCI treatment in the clinic.
