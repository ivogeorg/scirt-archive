Abstract
In fresh-water turtles, the bridge connecting the proximal and caudal stumps of transected spinal
cords consists of regenerating axons running through a glial cellular matrix. To understand the
process leading to the generation of the scaffold bridging the lesion, we analyzed the mitotic
activity triggered by spinal injury in animals maintained alive for 20–30 days after spinal cord
transection. Flow cytometry and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeling experiments revealed a
significant increment of cycling cells around the lesion epicenter. BrdU-tagged cells maintained a
close association with regenerating axons. Most dividing cells expressed the brain lipid-binding
protein (BLBP). Cells with BrdU-positive nuclei expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein. As spinal
cord regeneration involves dynamic cell rearrangements, we explored the ultra-structure of the
bridge and found cells with the aspect of immature oligodendrocytes forming an embryonic-like
microenvironment. These cells supported and ensheathed regenerating axons that were recognized
by immunocytological and electron-microscopical procedures. Since functional recovery depends
on proper impulse transmission, we examined the anatomical axon-glia relationships near the
lesion epicenter. Computer-assisted three-dimensional models revealed helical axon-glial
junctions in which the intercellular space appeared to be reduced (5–7 nm). Serial-sectioning
analysis revealed that fibril-containing processes provided myelinating axon sheaths. Thus,
disruption of the ependymal layer elicits mitotic activity predominantly in radial glia expressing
BLBP on the lateral aspects of the ependyma. These cycling cells seem to migrate and contribute
to the bridge providing the main support and sheaths for regenerating axons.

Introduction
Anamniotes such as cyclostomes (Rovainen 1976; Wood and Cohen 1979; Armstrong et al.
2003; Shifman et al. 2007), certain fish (Coggeshall and Youndblood 1983; Dervan and
Roberts 2003; Takeda et al. 2007; Reimer et al. 2008), anuran larvae (Lorente de Nó 1921;
Michel and Reier 1979; Beattie et al. 1990; Gibbs and Szaro 2006), and tailed amphibians
(Piatt 1955; Butler and Ward 1965; Stensaas 1983; Davis et al. 1990; Chevallier et al. 2004;
Mchedlishvili et al. 2007) are able to repair their damaged spinal cords and to recover some
of the functions lost by injury. In addition, we have recently reported that an amniote
vertebrate (the fresh-water turtle, Trachemys dorbignyi) also exhibits outstanding self-
repairing capabilities after the complete transection of the spinal cord. Turtles spontaneously
reconnect their severed spinal cords, leading in some cases to substantial motor recovery
(Rehermann et al. 2009). The same study has revealed the occurrence of regenerated axons
traveling on a cellular scaffold bridging the injured spinal cord segments. In contrast to
mammals, reactive glial cells in turtles do not form the typical “glial scar” blocking the
passage of incoming axons (Ramón y Cajal 1913–1914; Silver and Miller 2004; Thuret et al.
2006). The present work focuses on the following: (1) the reconnection of the transected
cord mediated by axonal regrowth and cell proliferation, (2) the identification of the origin
of some of the regenerating axons, (3) an assessment of the spatial spread of the mitotic
wave elicited by spinal cord transection, (4) the nature of the proliferating cells facilitating
axonal growing, and (5) a study of the early steps of the remyelination process that occurs
during repair.
Transection of the spinal cord and the concomitant retraction of the rostral and caudal
stumps create a gap that is initially filled by a clot. This is replaced later by a cellular bridge
supporting the transit of the regenerating axons (Rehermann et al. 2009). The development
of this cellular scaffold should involve active cell proliferation and cell migration toward the
damaged site. Since spinal cord injuries trigger mitotic activity in the cord parenchyma
(Adrian and Walker 1962; Liu et al. 1998, 2000; Mothe and Tator 2005; Vessal et al. 2007;
Meletis et al. 2008), we hypothesize that the injured site should contain a large number of
cycling cells in close association with the regenerating axons. To test this hypothesis, we
have employed two technical approaches: (1) the quantification of dividing cells by flow
cytometry (FC), and (2) the quantification of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-tagged cells in
sections obtained at various spinal cord levels. We have also determined the nature of the
cycling cells by double-labeling immunocytochemical experiments in BrdU-injected turtles.
Spinal cord regeneration involves processes such as the replacement of lost cells, axonal
growth with navigation toward proper targets, and remyelination (Horner and Gage 2000;
Thuret et al. 2006). These diverse events normally occur dynamically during the
development of the central nervous system (Sanes et al. 2006). We thus hypothesize that,
during endogenous repair of the turtle spinal cord, an embryonic-like environment appears
in the healing zone. During this process, regenerating axons have to be myelinated if they
are to conduct rapid signals for an efficient functional recovery (Horner and Gage 2000).
This does not exclude the regeneration of non-myelinated axons that, for example, might
contribute to the restoration of important vegetative functions. To analyze the
microenvironment surrounding the regenerating axons at the bridge level and the early
myelination process, we have taken advantage of the high resolution offered by transmission

electron microscopy (TEM) complemented with computer-assisted three-dimensional (3D)
models. The TEM data show a loose cellular organization that differs from the compact
histological architecture characteristic of the undamaged spinal cord. Within this embryonic-
like microenvironment, we have found diverse stages of ensheathing that range from
partially covered axons to complete sheaths with multiple myelin layers. In line with our
previous results (Rehermann et al. 2009), these are the first reports that, in an amniote
vertebrate, new cells are incorporated into the disrupted spinal cord region creating a
suitable microenvironment for the displacement of target-searching glial processes in
parallel with axonal regrowth.
Materials and methods
Animals
Fresh-water turtles (Trachemys dorbignyi, with carapace lengths ranging between 5–12 cm;
n=27) were maintained in temperate aquaria (28–30°C) under natural illumination and fed
daily with small earthworms. The selected temperature optimizes turtle feeding behavior and
also promotes cell proliferation (Radmilovich et al. 2003). All the studies were conducted
under the guidance of our local Committee for Animal Care and Research following NIH
guidelines for the maintenance and use of laboratory animals (CHEA, UDELAR).
Surgical procedures
The relevant surgical procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (Rehermann et al.
2009). Briefly, turtles were sedated with ketamine chlorhydrate (40 mg/kg body weight) and
deeply anesthetized with isofluorane (Forane, Abbott Laboratories, Berkshire, UK). The
third dorsal scute was then partially removed to expose the underlying spinal cord, which
was transversally cut at the level of the 13th–14th thoraxic (from the 1st cervical vertebra)
vertebrae with a fine scalpel. Completeness of the section was checked by observing the
immediate retraction and separation of both spinal stumps with diameters ranging between
250 and 300 μm. The space between the resulting stumps was about 0.1 mm (based on
measurements of the clot width). Histological evidence indicating the efficacy of the
surgical procedure was as previously presented (Rehermann et al. 2009, Fig. 1). Finally, the
lifted scute was replaced and glued with cyanoacrylate. We also performed “sham”
experiments in which the spinal cord was exposed but not injured (n=3). Despite the
paralysis of the hindlimbs, the animals were able to catch living prey and did not require
special postoperative care. All operated animals (n=19) were maintained in temperate
aquaria (25°C) and fed with living earthworms. All experiments were carried out on animals
maintained alive for 20–30 days after spinal cord transection. We selected this time window
because previous studies (Rehermann et al. 2009) had indicated that the bridge connecting
the caudal and cephalic stumps had developed, and that the majority of injured turtles had
started to show movements (still uncoordinated) of their hindlimbs.
Flow cytometry
Spinal cord portions of 3–4 mm in length were obtained from homologous regions of control
animals (n=3), sham-experimented turtles (n=3), and injured turtles (n=3) were washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and disaggregated in 400 μl PBS by chopping with a razor
blade. The cell suspension was then filtered through a 45-μm nylon mesh to remove tissue
debris. Cells were fixed drop by drop with 1 ml fresh ice-cold ethanol (70% absolute
ethanol, 30% filtered PBS) by using a vortex to avoid the formation of cell clumps. Within
24–48 h after fixation, the cell suspension was centrifugated at 1200 rpm for 6 min and
resuspended in 250 μl PBS after discarding the supernatant. For DNA staining, 25 μl
propidium iodide (PI; 1 mg/ml; Sigma) was added to the cell suspension with 25 μl RNase A

(1 mg/ml; Sigma) to avoid the staining of double-stranded RNA. Samples were kept on ice
for 10 min and immediately analyzed by FC.
A FACSVantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson [BD], San José, USA) equipped with a
water-cooled argon ion LASER Innova 304 (Coherent, USA) tuned to emit at 488 nm was
used. The laser power was set to 100 mW, and the fluorescence emitted from PI was
collected in FL2 by using a 575/26 band-pass filter. A 70-μm nozzle was selected to perform
flow cytometric measurements. To optimize fluorescence detection and to check instrument
linearity, we used chicken red blood cells and DNA QC particles (BD). Forward scatter
(FSC-H), side scatter (SSC-H), pulse-area or total emitted fluorescence (FL2-A), and pulse-
width or duration of fluorescence emission (FL2-W) were analyzed with CELLQuest
software (BD). Dot plots of FL2-A versus time were used as a control of fluorescence
emission during sample analysis. A total of 5000 events were analyzed per sample. Doublets
were excluded from the analysis through gating on the G1, S, and G2 cell populations (R1)
in FL2-A versus FL2-W dot plots. The relative proportion of cells in S and G2 phase was
estimated in a FL2-A histogram based on R1 gated data by using appropriate markers
(M1=G1 and M2=S+G2/M).
BrdU injection and immunocytochemistry
Turtles with injured cords (n=3) began to receive intraperitoneal BrdU injections 20 days
after surgery. They were injected during 3 consecutive days (daily injections of 100 mg kg
body weigth), anesthetized as described, and fixed by perfusion on the fourth day. Uninjured
control turtles (n=3) also received the same BrdU doses and were anesthetized and fixed by
perfusion on the fourth day. Fixed spinal cords from turtles injected with BrdU were
dissected out and divided into separated portions of 4 mm in length. To maintain an ordered
cephalic-caudal arrangement of the partitioned cord, we made asymmetric cuts in the
cephalic and caudal surfaces of each portion. The region comprising the damaged cord was
identified as the lesion epicenter (LEPI), because of its more transparent appearance as
viewed under the dissection microscope. The LEPI was considered as a landmark separating
rostral from caudal segments (RS-CS). The spinal cords were serially cut (70 μm thickness)
with a vibrating microtome, and the floating sections were sequentially collected in
numbered plastic wells. Twenty sections were randomly selected from LEPI and 10 sections
from both adjacent RS and CS. BrdU detection was performed as follows: the sections were
pretreated with 2 N HCl, washed several times with phosphate buffer (PB), and incubated
overnight with the BrdU antibody. For quantitative studies, the secondary antibody was
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and processed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. For
double-staining experiments, secondary antibodies were conjugated with appropriated
fluorophores.
For other immunohistochemistry studies (n=4), tissues were sectioned with a vibrating
microtome (at 60–80 μm). Sections were placed in PB with 0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) for 30 min and then incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in PB with 0.3%
Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). Incubation times and antibody concentrations were
optimized for each case. After being washed in PB, sections were incubated in secondary
antibodies conjugated with various fluorophores. In co-labeling experiments, Alexa 488 and
633 (Invitrogen) were used to avoid cross-talk. We carried out controls by suppressing
primary antibodies during tissue processing.
To immunophenotype dividing cells and to label the growing axons, we assayed various
antibodies as shown in Table 1.
Unspecific sites were routinely blocked with BSA (0.5%), and then sections were incubated
overnight with the primary serum (in PB and 0.3% Triton-X 100). After being washed, the

sections were incubated with the secondary antibodies (1:200–1:1000). Control experiments
were carried out by replacing antibodies with preimmune serum.
Axonal tracers
To identify the origin of the regenerating axons crossing the lesion, we used two technical
procedures involving fixed and living tissues. In some experiments, we applied 1,1′, di-
octadecyl 1–3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylcarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Invitrogen) crystals to fixed
tissues (Godement et al. 1987; Köbbert et al. 2000), specifically to the sensory nerves
entering the cord rostral to the lesion site. At the anterior limit of the third scute (vertebral
segments 11th–12th), the spinal ganglia and sensory nerves are more accessible than at other
levels, and hence spurious labeling would be more difficult to avoid. In other experiments,
the same lipophilic dye was applied to the cut surfaces of the cord 3–4 mm caudal to the
lesion site. Experiments involving living animals were performed by pressure-injecting
neurobiotin (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif., USA; SP-1120-Lot no. 1106) into the caudal
portions of the cord (15th–16th segments) in spinal-transected turtles.
As shown in Fig. 1, the incoming sensory nerves are easily accessible away from their
entrance into the ganglia. To reduce the risk of spurious labeling when applying DiI to the
cut surface of the cord, we carried out experiments in which the sectioned surface was
maintained within the vertebral canal and covered with an ultrathin film of Polyvinyl
Formvar (Polysciences, Warrington, Pa., USA) supported on Sjöstrand-type rings (Sjöstrand
1967); this film remained attached to the cord and formed a continuous coat. The film was
then pierced with a fine glass needle, and DiI crystals were deposited on the perforated spot.
By this means, direct contact of the tracer and tissues was limited to the small area
underlying the opening made in the film coat (Fig. 2a). To avoid the potential spread of DiI
outside the desired target during incubation, the region was covered with a second film that
firmly stuck to the first. Labeled samples were transferred to a 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS
solution and placed in the dark at 37°C for 20 days. After incubation, the film was removed
with a pair of fine tweezers, and the pieces were embedded in a mixture of albumin and
gelatin, hardened with glutaraldehyde, and sectioned with a vibrating microtome.
We also performed “in vivo” experiments to identify retrogradely labeled neurons. A
neurobiotin solution (10 mM in saline; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif., USA) was
pressure injected (Picospritzer III, Parker Instrumentation) with a glass micropipette placed
within the caudal stumps of the spinal cord 20–30 days following injury (Fig. 2b). At 4 days
after injection, the animals were fixed by perfusion, and the spinal cord was sectioned with a
vibrating microtome. To reveal the presence of retrogradely labeled neurons in segments
cephalic to the lesion site, the sections were incubated in a 0.5% BSA solution for 1 h,
washed in PBS several times, and transferred to a 1/400 solution of streptavidin conjugated
with Alexa Fluor 633 (Invitrogen, cat. no. S21375) for 2 h. For the tracer experiments, we
employed 5 turtles.
Fluorescent signals were detected by using epifluorescence or confocal microscopy
(Olympus VF 300). The images were imported into Fluoview 5 (Olympus) and then
exported to PhotoShop (Adobe Systems, San José, Calif., USA) or CorelDraw (Corel
Corporation, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) for cropping and the creation of figure montages.
When considered pertinent, the preparations were also viewed under Nomarsky optics. The
images recorded with the confocal microscope were single optical sections and stacks
resulting from the superposition of multiple optical sections. Transverse images of the stacks
following the x-z and y-z planes were obtained with FluoView 5 (Olympus). When making
stacks, we followed the data provided by the software to adjust spacing along the z axis and
the diameter of the pinhole.

TEM procedures
For TEM studies (n=3), the spinal cords of anesthetized turtles were fixed by perfusion in an
aldehyde mixture containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde dissolved in 0.1
M PB (pH 7.4). Small spinal cord portions were washed several times in PB and post-fixed
in 1% OsO4 dissolved in the same buffer. The pieces were dehydrated and embedded in
Durcupan ACM. Series of ultrathin sections were mounted on Formvar-coated slot grids
(2×1 mm) and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The material was examined
with a Jeol CX electron microscope equipped with a 4000 AM DVC digital camera. All 3D
representations were obtained with the BioVis program (www@biovos3d.com) based on
images obtained from continuous series of ultrathin sections.
Quantification and statistical analysis
For a comparison of cell proliferation in control, sham-injured, and injured spinal cords as
shown by FC, a non-parametric one-sided Wilcoxon test was used. A value of P< 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
To estimate the number of BrdU-tagged nuclei, we followed the guidelines proposed by
Guillery and Herrup (1997). We counted the labeled nuclei enclosed within a circle (150 μm
radius) centered on the central canal (CC). Counts were further processed by applying the
Abercrombie correction (Abercrombie 1946). The same protocol was employed to estimate
the number of BrdU-tagged nuclei in control experiments. In these cases, we identified, as
topologically equivalent to LEPI, the spinal cord region (4 mm long) underlying the third
scute. Distribution profiles of both injured and control animals were generated by plotting
the Abercrombie-corrected data obtained from each section level (y axes) versus distances
(measured in micrometers) from the lesion site (x axes). The significance of the differences
between injured and control animals was estimated by applying the Kruskal-Wallis and the
Wilcoxon pair-wise non-parametric tests (for details, see Results).
Results
Regenerating axons “bridge” injured site
To confirm that the amputated axons were able to regenerate and to cross the lesion site, we
employed immunocytochemical and axon-labeling procedures. As shown in Fig. 3a, at 20
days after spinal cord transection, nerve fibers positive for Neurofilament M (NF-M) had
crossed the injured site. At the tips of some of these fibers, we found the typical growth
cones described by Ramón y Cajal (1913–1914) in the injured spinal cord of the different
mammals. As in the regenerating spinal cord of cyclostomes (Shifman et al. 2007) and
tadpoles (Lorente de Nó 1921), these growth cones adopted the form of cylindroconical
masses or lanceolated endings without conspicuous filopodia (Fig. 3bc). The morphology of
these growth cones was less elaborate than that reported for growth cones in the developing
spinal cord of Xenopus tadpoles (Nordlander 1987). We also observed small terminal
“rings” (Fig. 3c, d) reported to occur during axonal sprouting in the injured central nervous
system (Ramón y Cajal 1913–1914) or in some synaptic contacts (Gray and Guillery 1961;
Novotny 1979). To confirm the occurrence of growth cones, we performed TEM studies.
Consistent with previous work (Tennyson 1970; Landis 1983; Williams et al. 1988), our
images revealed that the bulbous tips of sprouting axons contained numerous clear-core
vesicles together with a small number of “coated vesicles”. The vesicular material was
intermingled with fine disorganized thin fibrils (Fig. 3d–f).
The zone that contained growing axons also exhibited some of the classical “retraction
balls” of Ramón y Cajal (1913–1914) or dystrophic nerve bulbs. This other kind of axonal
compartment was larger than growth cones and tended to exhibit a spherical shape (Fig. 3g).

When examined with TEM (Fig. 3h), these end bulbs were recognized not only by their
larger size, but also by fine structural details such as the presence of a neurofibrillar core,
sparse dispersed dense-core vesicles, and large electron-dense phagosomes (Williams et al.
1988). More recent investigations support the view that these enlarged terminals are
metabolically active axons in the stand-by mode (Li and Raisman 1995; Houle and Jin 2001)
and not decaying nerve fibers as originally proposed by Ramón y Cajal (1913–1914).
Axon-labeling experiments employing DiI and neurobiotin (Huang et al. 1992) provided
information about the origin of some of the crossing fibers (Fig. 4a). When DiI crystals were
applied to the tips of sectioned sensory nerves close to dorsal ganglia that lay rostral to the
injured zone, sensory neurons in the ganglia (Fig. 4b) and the entering axons (Fig. 4c)
appeared stained at various levels of the cord. Labeled axons were recognized at the bridge
region and also within the caudal stump (Fig. 4d). Double-labeling experiments with NF-M
antibody revealed DiI-stained axons running between neurons caudal to the lesion site (Fig.
4e). In a previous paper, we have described synaptic-like contacts between regenerated
sensory fibers and spinal cord neurons (Rehermann et al. 2009). These results are consistent
with the recognized regeneration overcapabilities of the dorsal root axons (Ramón y Cajal
1913–1914; Davies et al. 1999). We obtained robust staining of crossing axons when DiI
crystals were applied to the cut surface of the cord in regions caudal to the injured site (Fig.
4f, g). Moreover, some of the parent perikarya were depicted in regions rostral to the lesion
site by retrograde diffusion of the dye along the axonal membranes (Fig. 4h). As reported
previously (Rehermann et al. 2009), DiI-stained neurons were commonly of a small size and
appeared to form assemblies distributed at various levels of the rostral stump. Thorough low
power exploration of the mesenchymal sheaths covering the regenerating bridge showed no
evidence of “dye bleeding” toward the regenerating axon bundles. In addition, high
magnification confocal images revealed the specific staining of axons of diverse diameters
without evidence of dye transport via the extracellular space (Fig. 4g). Low power images
covering several cord segments also indicated that the meninges were free from dye
labeling, thus making spurious stain originating from this source unlikely. These
experiments indicated that some of the regenerating axons originated from sensory
collaterals running along the dorsal funiculi and also from medium-sized interneurons lying
close to the injured region. Additional evidence resulted from “in vivo” experiments
involving the retrograde transport of neurobiotin. These experiments confirmed that small
and medium-sized neurons, located close to the injured site, were one of the sources of
regenerating axons. Using this technical approach (Huang et al. 1992), we found Golgi-like
and granular stained neurons (Fig. 5a). Abundant Golgi-like labeled processes occurred near
the stained neuron pools (Fig. 5b, arrows).
Newborn cells for repairing injured spinal cord
In the spinal cord of the turtle, substantial cell proliferation occurs in the ground state
(Fernández et al. 2002; Russo et al. 2008). To investigate whether the number of cycling
cells was affected by spinal injury, the cell cycle profile was examined by measuring the
DNA content of PI-stained cells by FC. Typical examples comparing normal uninjured
turtles, sham experiments, and spinal-transected animals are illustrated in Fig. 6, Table 2.
The distribution of cells in the three cycle phases showed a significant increment of cycling
cells in the injured animals. The increment was statistically significant (P<0.05, one-sided
Wilcoxon rank-sum test) at LEPI without statistically significant differences at more rostral
or caudal levels.
To study the spatial extension of the increased cell proliferation, we performed “fine grain”
experiments in which S-phase cells were BrdU-stained, and the number of BrdU-tagged
nuclei were estimated at various spinal cord levels. This technical approach with various
fluorophores allowed double-labeling experiments for the identification of the nature of the

cycling cells and their relationships with the regenerating axons. As in the FC experiments,
we found, at the LEPI level, a statistically significant increase in the number of BrdU-
positive nuclei in the injured animals compared with control animals (Fig. 7a). The Kruskal-
Wallis test showed that independent samples from three injured turtles (20 samples each
group) came from distributions with equal medians. The same test showed that control
turtles (n=3, 20 samples each group) also had distributions with equal medians. The
Wilcoxon test between injured and control turtles revealed that medians were significantly
different (P<0.000001). However, differences between injured and control animals
attenuated dramatically at more cephalic or caudal portions of the cord. At these levels,
Wilcoxon pair-wise tests (Bonferroni correction) demonstrated that the number of labeled
nuclei in the injured animals was significantly larger than that in controls (P<0.05) only in
seven out of nine pair-wise comparisons (in both rostral and caudal segments).
Analysis in the transverse plane showed BrdU-labeled cells throughout the spinal
parenchyma (Fig. 7b, c) with concentrations of labeled nuclei around the CC (Fig. 7d).
BrdU-tagged nuclei were evenly stained or exhibited dark granules in contrast to the pale
nuclear background (not shown). Examination at the light-microscope level also revealed
typical mitotic figures (Fig. 7e) that were confirmed by employing TEM procedures in
injured but not BrdU-injected turtles (Fig. 7f). To determine the relationship between the
cycling cells and the pathways of regenerating axons, we performed double-labeling
experiments with an axon-marking antibody (NF-M). As shown in Fig. 7g, h, NF-M-
positive axons travelled through the bridge region associated with cells exhibiting BrdU-
positive nuclei. The exploration of orthogonal planes (x-z and y-z axes) obtained from
optical stacks revealed a close association between the nerve fibers crossing the injured
region and cycling cells (Fig. 7h). This intimate relationship between cells in the bridge and
the crossing axons was explored in detail by employing TEM procedures (see below).
Molecular phenotypes of cycling cells
To identify the molecular phenotypes of cycling cells, we performed double-labeling
experiments employing glial and neuronal markers. The use of brain lipid-binding protein
(BLBP) antibody (Feng et al. 1994) indicated robust double-labeling of BrdU-positive cells
(Fig. 8a). In addition, the low power images illustrated the lax organization of the cells
expressing BLBP, a feature consistent with our TEM findings (see below). Analysis of the
tissues at higher magnification confirmed unambiguously that some of the cells expressing
BLBP had incorporated BrdU (Fig. 8b–d).
A different picture resulted from the use of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody.
GFAP expression was mainly restricted to cell processes with few identifiable cell bodies
(Reichenbach and Wolburg 2005). Therefore, reliable assessment of double-labeling was a
difficult task. However, we were able to identify a few cell bodies expressing GFAP and
containing BrdU-labeled nuclei (Fig. 8e–g). In the bridge region, none of the BrdU-positive
cells expressed the neuronal marker, anti-human neuronal protein (not shown). Disregarding
the bias that might have been introduced by difficulties in identifying the cell bodies of
GFAP-positive cells, our prevalent view is that most proliferating cells expressed BLBP.
Cytoarchitecture of the bridge: an embryonic-like environment
In contrast to the usual compact cell organization found in both the gray and white matter of
the spinal cord, the bridge was characterized by a loose arrangement of cells and axons.
Bridge cells formed a scaffold supporting and enveloping bundles of regenerating axons
(Fig. 9a). The more abundant cells shared characteristics of fibril-containing glia and the
axon-ensheathing properties of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. In cross sections, they
exhibited a polymorphic appearance with multiple processes stemming from the perinuclear

cytoplasm. We have previously reported that, in turtles, typical radial glia (RG) are present
with their processes filled with compact bundles of fine fibrils (Trujillo-Cenóz et al. 2007).
Interestingly, cells with characteristics of a “hybrid oligodendrocyte/RG antigenic
phenotype and a RG morphology” have been described in rats (Choi et al. 1983; Choi and
Kim 1985; Hirano and Goldman 1988; Fogarty et al. 2005). The mechanical stability of the
cell scaffold seems to be mediated by multiple intercellular contacts (Fig. 9a, arrows), some
of which exhibit the fine structural characteristics of desmosomes (Fig. 9e). Additional
cytoskeleton strength might be provided by compact bundles of gliofibrils present in most
glial processes.
Small and medium-sized regenerating axons appeared encased within infolds of the cell
plasma membrane or covered by several glial lamellae containing gliofibrils (Fig. 9c, d).
Similarly, neural processes “enclosed with fascicles formed by ependymal processes” have
been described by Michel and Reier (1979) in Xenopus laevis tadpoles during early
regeneration of the transected spinal cord. To examine in detail the anatomical axon-glial
relationships, we generated 3D models based on TEM images obtained from uninterrupted
series of ultrathin sections (Fig. 9f). The models revealed that, at this stage, most of the
regenerating axons were loosely covered by discontinuous glial membranes. Together with
the usual axon-glia spacing (20 nm wide), more intimate axon-glia junctions were present
characterized by an increased electron density and a reduced periaxonal space of 5–7 nm in
width (Fig. 10a, b). The 3D models revealed that these electron-dense junctions were not
continuous but formed irregular helical bands extending along the ensheated axon (Fig. 10c,
arrowheads in 3D models). Serial section analysis also showed that axon-enveloping could
be initiated from a glial cell prolongation containing bundles of gliofilaments (Fig. 11a, b)
similar to those of RG. TEM images and the resulting 3D model (Fig. 11e) revealed the
spatial progress of ensheating. The example illustrated in Fig. 11 shows the starting point of
the enveloping process with a small axon-glial contacting area (Fig. 11a) and the fully
ensheathed axon with the familiar multilamellar myelin organization at the end of the series
(Fig. 11c, d). Notably, the dense helicoidal junctions remained present, even at this more
advanced myelination stage (Fig. 11g).
Discussion
Amputated axons regenerate and bridge the transected cord
The experiments described in this paper are in agreement with previous findings indicating
that freshwater turtles are able to attain the neural reconnection of the severed cord
(Rehermann et al. 2009). We also present compelling evidence that regenerating axons
originate from two main sources: (1) sensory fibers arising from the dorsal root ganglia and
(2) axons from propiospinal interneurons lying close to the lesion site in the rostral stump.
Our results suggest that axons stemming from neurons of higher centers do not make a
major contribution to the early reconnection process. However, the time window used in our
experimental approach cannot exclude the possibility that axons from higher centers might
cross the lesion site at later stages, reconnecting them with spinal neurons. Reactivation of
anatomically circumscribed circuits close to the lesion site by regrowth of sensory axons
seems to play a crucial role during spinal cord reconnection. We have found evidence that
sensory axons originating from cephalic portions of the cord cross the lesion site. However,
the contribution of axonal regrowth from sensory fibers arising from caudal ganglia is also
possible. Application of axonal tracers emitting light at different wavelengths in sensory
nerves caudal and rostral with respect to the lesion site might help to solve this issue.
The regeneration capabilities of turtles appear limited when compared with those of anuran
tadpoles in which mesencephalic and rhombencephalic neurons are retrogradelly labeled
after spinal cord regeneration (Gibbs and Szaro 2006). We should keep in mind, however,

that functional recovery in turtles is incomplete, because injured animals are able to recover
stepping but not normal swimming (Rehermann et al. 2009). Nonetheless, our findings
support the view that the regenerative capacities of the spinal cord are not exclusive to
anamniotes and remain, even though restricted, in some post-natal amniotes.
Injury increases mitotic activity
In the normal uninjured spinal cord of rats, slow basal mitotic activity mainly occurs in
white matter tracts. The majority of BrdU-labeled cells express glial markers (Horner et al.
2000). However, in the same animals, spinal injury induces an increment of proliferating
cells. Under these circumstances, the BrdU-labeled nuclei colocalize with progenitor or glial
cell markers but never with neuronal proteins (Horky et al. 2006). Surprisingly, indirect
damage of the spinal cord (e.g., rhizotomy) induces not only cell proliferation, but also the
generation of new neurons (Vessal et al. 2007). This suggests that different insults might
activate progenitors with various lineage potentials.
A different scenario occurs in turtles. In these reptiles, mitotic activity persists, being mainly
concentrated on the lateral aspects of the CC. In these regions, clusters of electrical- and
dye-coupled RG occur with the molecular and physiological characteristics of cycling
precursor cells (Russo et al. 2008). Our experiments employing both FC and BrdU-labeling
have revealed that spinal cord transection elicits a noticeable increment in the mitotic
activity of some spinal cells and that this peaks at the LEPI and decreases steeply both in the
rostral and in the caudal directions. The observed cell proliferation is consistent with the
formation of a cellular scaffold that supports the navigation of sprouting axonal branches,
which cross the damaged region (Rehermann et al. 2009).
Nature of the cycling cells
Studies carried out on lizards (Egar et al 1970), tailed amphibians (Singer et al. 1979; Zhang
et al. 2000; Mchedlishvili et al. 2007), and immature eels (Dervan and Roberts 2003) have
revealed the role played by ependymal cells in the healing and reconstruction of the injured
spinal cord. Our findings are, in general, coincident with these previous reports. In the turtle,
BLBP-positive RG that flank the CC form clusters of cells that are electrically and
metabolically coupled, incorporate BrdU, express Pax6, and display electrophysiological
properties characteristic of neural progenitors (Russo et al. 2008). A plausible hypothesis is
that neural injury elicits an increment of the intrinsic basal mitotic activity sustained by the
lateral clusters of RG, thereby generating cells that migrate to the injured site. The capability
of RG expressing BLBP to contribute to neural repair has been demonstrated in rodents in
which transplanted embryonic RG “bridge spinal cord lesions and promote functional
recovery” (Hasegawa et al. 2004). However, we cannot exclude as yet an alternative
situation similar to that described in rats. In this rodent, the neuron/glia-type 2 antigen
(NG2)-expressing progenitors appear to be vulnerable to injury, but a separate neural stem
cell population is activated to replace the damaged one (Horky et al. 2006). Therefore, the
cycling cells found in the injured spinal cord of turtles might belong to another non-
vulnerable cell population; this population might be the one that actually initiates mitotic
activity. At present, we cannot exclude the possibility that oligodendrocytes ensheathing the
amputated axons or Schwann cells covering the entering sensory roots can dedifferentiate to
envelope the regenerated axons within the bridge. Additionaly, the expression of RG
markers such as BLBP in cells within the bridge might arise from reactive astrocytes
transformed to an immature state (Shibuya et al. 2003; Iseda et al. 2004). However, the fine
structural evidence indicates a predominance of gliofibrill-containing cells covering the
sprouting axons, thus suggesting a RG origin.

Since turtles exhibit neural reconnection and partial motor recovery, it is pertinent to ask
how the proliferating niches are remodeled after injury. This issue has been investigated in
rats by using retrovirus technology to target NG2-expressing cells (Sellers et al. 2009) but
remains unexplored in turtles. In addition to BLBP-positive cells, some GFAP-positive cells
also appear with BrdU-stained nuclei. However, since the most robust expression of the
protein occurs in their fine processes (Reichenbach and Wolburg 2005), an evaluation of the
contribution of the GFAP-positive cells to the total population of cycling cells is difficult.
Cytoarchitectural remodeling during neural reconnection
The zone bridging the disrupted spinal cord exhibits a peculiar structure with loose
intercellular contacts and an enlarged extracellular space, all of which resemble embryonic
cell organization. In this respect, our TEM images are similar to those published by Singer et
al. (1979) in the regenerating cord of the newt. The cytoarchitecture and the abundance of
finger-like processes and lamellae suggest a highly dynamic scenario. Indeed, recent “in
vivo” studies performed in developing zebrafish have provided compelling evidence that
oligodendrocyte progenitors move actively and send processes back and forth to reach and
recognize their relevant axon targets (Kirby et al. 2006). Moreover, highly motile growth-
cone-like structures have been observed in cultured post-migratory premyelinating
oligodendrocyte (Fox et al. 2006). In turtles, cells belonging to the bridge matrix also behave
as oligodendrocyte precursors and/or premyelinating oligodendrocytes (Levine et al. 2001)
enveloping regenerating axons. Then, analogous dynamic phenomena most probably occur
in the embryonic-like microenvironment supporting neural repair in the turtle spinal cord.
In view of the structural similarities between the regenerating spinal cord and the embryonic
tissues, we can pertinently discuss the regeneration potentialities of the spinal cord at
various developmental stages. For example, during the development of the chick spinal cord,
the effects of spinal injury are known to change from successful to unsuccessful repair and
recovery around embryonic day 13 (E13; Ferretti and Whalley 2008). Taking advantage of
the facilities offered by this classical model, and using fluorescent tracing labels, Hasan et
al. (1993) have established that, following complete transection in the later stages of the
“permissive period” (E10–13; Keirstead et al. 1992), spinal cord repair is increasingly
attributable to true axonal regeneration and not to developmental regulation (for a
discussion, see Ferretti and Whalley 2008).
The end of the permissive period has been associated with the onset of myelination, since its
delay (by injection of a monoclonal antibody against a galactocerebroside) results in
complete neuroanatomical repair and functional recovery. This occurs even if the spinal cord
is severed as late as E15 (Keirstead et al. 1992). In turtles, the permissive period has been
extended to the postnatal period and seems to be independent of the myelination process.
However, an exploration of the possibility that antibodies against myelin might affect the
repairing process in the turtle should be of interest.
In regenerating spinal cords of turtles, the analysis of a series of sections has indicated that
the axon-glial anatomical relationships range from simple small areas of contact to thick
complete cytoplasmic envelopes surrounding the regenerating axons. Two issues are worth
discussing here. The first is concerned with the presence of electron-dense junctions
distributed along the periaxonal space. High magnification images have revealed that, in
these junctions, the extracellular space appears to be dramatically reduced, as occurs in gap
junctions. Nevertheless, the functional significance of these axon-glial junctions is unclear.
Gap junction coupling via Cx43 and Cx26 is important for the regulation of a variety of
cellular events during cortical development (Bittman et al. 1997; Bruzzone and Dermietzel
2006; Elias et al. 2007). If gap-junction-like structures in the bridge are fully functional, they
might represent a key pathway for electrical and metabolic signaling between regenerating

axons and oligodendrocyte-like cells. In turtles, we have previously determined that both
Cx26 and Cx43 are expressed around the CC in which the BLBP domains of precursors are
located (Russo et al. 2008). Interestingly, during development, both Cx26 and Cx43 have
recently been demonstrated to have a role as adhesion molecules critical for the migration of
newborn neurons along RG processes (Elias et al. 2007). Therefore, the dense junctions
might represent points of anchorage for the movement of ensheating processes around
regenerating axons. Our 3D models have shown that these areas of intimate contact are
discontinuous and helically distributed along the axon axis. This may reflect a helicoidal
movement of the glial cell during the ensheating processes. An alternative explanation for
these junctions is that they might be the earliest evidence of the transverse bands that have
been found in paranodal regions of mature myelinated axons and that behave, in peripheral
nerve fibers, as paracellular barriers to solute flow (Hall and Williams 1971). In peripheral
nerves, a major transition in the molecular phenotype of Schwann cells is believed to be
driven by signals from the axons, with these, in turn, being remodeled by signals from the
enveloping glia (Salzer 2003; Simons and Trotter 2007). Immunoelectron microscopy
should help to resolve the nature of these enigmatic gap-junction-like structures between
ensheating cells and regenerating axons.
The second issue deals with the myelination properties exhibited by gliofibril-containing
cells. Our 3D studies indicate that gliofibril-containing processes are able to produce myelin
lamellae like those generated by olygodendrocytes. This is in agreement with previous
evidence from rodents indicating that spinal cord RG can give rise to oligodendrocytes
(Choi et al. 1983; Choi and Kim 1985; Hirano and Goldman 1988).
Concluding remarks
Overall, our findings indicate that spinal cord injury elicits cell proliferation, particularly in
cells expressing BLBP and GFAP. Because BLBP-positive cells on the lateral aspects of the
CC maintain mitotic activity (Russo et al. 2008), they might be the main source of BLBP/
BrdU-positive cells found in the bridge region. Alternatively, the BLBP- and GFAP-
expressing cells in the bridge zone might arise from other types of progenitor, such as those
responsible for the formation of new blood vessels in the regenerating cord (Rehermann et
al. 2009). The emerging picture, when comparing our data with those described for
anamniotes, is that, in the latter, the ependymal layer as a whole has retained some
properties of the embryonic neural tube. For example, in Xenopus tadpoles, a close axonal-
ependymal association exists during the early stages of the regeneration process (Michel and
Reier 1979), and in axolotls, the cells lining the CC regenerate the spinal cord by inducing a
multipotent blastema (Schnapp et al. 2005; Tanaka and Ferretti 2009). In turtles, however,
the bridge region lacks a distinguishable CC. In any case, the BLBP-positive cells of the
ependymal layer appear as the most likely candidates for the abundant pre-myelinating
oligodendrocytes that envelop the incoming axons. The role played by the GFAP-positive
cells is unclear as yet. Nevertheless, contrasting with mammals, they do not interfere with
the transit of regenerating axons but appear aligned with axon bundles. Moreover, we have
not observed, in turtles, the cavitation that occurs normally in traumatized mammalian cords
(particularly in chronically injured human cords; Guest et al. 2005). Therefore, turtles appear
as a unique amniote model system occupying a peculiar intermediate place between the
anamniotes, with complete regenerating capabilities, and mammals, with highly restricted
capabilities for the restoration of damaged spinal circuitry.

Retrograde neuronal labeling. a To apply 1,1′, di-octadecyl 1–3,3,3′,3′-
tetramethylcarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) crystals to the cut surface of the cord but to
reduce the risk of spurious labeling of neighboring tissues, fixed cords and surrounding
tissues were covered with an adhering ultrathin Formvar film supported by Sjöstrand-type
metal rings. Small openings were made in the films, and DiI crystals were applied to the
film-coated cords. Direct contact between the lipophilic dye and tissues was thus reduced to
the area underlying the opening in the film. To avoid dispersion of DiI crystals during
incubation, each preparation was coated with a second layer of undamaged film. For
embedding and sectioning, dye crystals lying outside the central cord region were removed
