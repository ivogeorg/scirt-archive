BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
In the spinal cord injury (SCI) axon regeneration is inhibited by the glial scar, which contains reactive astrocytes that secrete
inhibitory chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG). We previously reported that a novel compound, denosomin, promotes
axonal growth under degenerative conditions in cultured cortical neurons. In this study, we investigated the effects of
denosomin on functional recovery in SCI mice and elucidated the mechanism though which denosomin induces axonal
growth in the injured spinal cord.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Denosomin was administered p.o. for 7 or 14 days to contusion mice. Behavioural evaluations and immunohistochemistry
were done. Primary cultured cortical neurons and astrocytes were treated with denosomin to investigate the mechanism of
axonal growth facilitation.
KEY RESULTS
Denosomin improved hind limb motor dysfunction and axonal growth, especially in the 5-HT-positive tracts across the scar
and increased the density of astrocytes. Denosomin increased astrocyte proliferation, inhibited astrocytic death and increased
the expression and secretion of vimentin in cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, vimentin increased axonal outgrowth in cultured
neurons, even in the presence of inhibitory CSPG. Denosomin increased the number of vimentin-expressing astrocytes inside
glial scars of SCI mice, and 5-HT-positive axonal growth occurred in a vimentin-associated manner.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Denosomin increased the ratio of astrocytes that secrete vimentin as an axonal growth facilitator, which, we propose
enhances axonal growth beyond the glial scar and promotes functional recovery in SCI mice. This study is the first to
demonstrate this novel role of vimentin in SCI and drug-mediated modification of the inhibitory property of reactive
astrocytes.

Introduction
Approximately 270 000 people in U.S. suffer from spinal cord
injury (SCI) (Spinal Cord Injury Facts and Figures at a Glance,
http://www.nscisc.uab.edu/), for which no effective drug
therapy currently exists. SCI causes serious locomotor dys-
function due to the disruption of the descending motor and
ascending sensory tracts at the lesion site. Several studies
have suggested that the CNS has the ability to regenerate and
that the regrowth of injured and/or spared axons may lead to
recovery from locomotor dysfunction (David and Aguayo,
1981). However, the environment of the injured spinal cord
inhibits axonal regeneration (Silver and Miller, 2004).
The formation of a glial scar, which is composed primarily
of reactive astrocytes and with a marked expression of glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Bignami and Dahl, 1974;
Barrett et al., 1981; Eng, 1985), at the lesion site in response to
injury is believed to be a major impediment to axonal regen-
eration after SCI and other forms of CNS injury (Davies et al.,
1997; Silver and Miller, 2004; Yiu and He, 2006). At the lesion
site, not only does the glial scar constitute a physical barrier
to axonal growth, but the reactive astrocytes produce inhibi-
tory extracellular matrix molecules such as chondroitin sul-
phate proteoglycan (CSPG) (McKeon et al., 1991; Jones et al.,
2003). However, several lines of evidence suggest that reactive
astrocytes in glial scars may possess important beneficial
functions for stabilizing fragile CNS tissue after injury includ-
ing the restriction of inflammation and the promotion of
neuronal survival (Faulkner et al., 2004; Okada et al., 2006;
Herrmann et al., 2008; Rolls et al., 2009). Reactive astrocytes,
by producing various neurotrophic factors and cytokines,
also exhibit adaptive plasticity (Aubert et al., 1995; Ridet
et al., 1997) and are able to restore the extracellular ionic
environment (Syková et al., 1992).
We previously synthesized a novel compound, deno-
somin (Figure 1) that is an analogous derivative of sominone
(Matsuya et al., 2009) and is hydrophobic (CLogP = 4.9803).
Sominone is a sapogenin metabolized from withanoside IV,
which is one of the constituents of an ayurvedic tonic medi-
cine Ashwagandha (root of Withania somnifera Dunal)
(Kuboyama et al., 2006), and is itself a constituent of Ashwa-
gandha (Atta-ur-Rahman et al., 1992). Our previous data
showed that denosomin enhances axonal length in cultured
cortical neurons, even after axonal dystrophy had been
induced by amyloid b(1–42) treatment (Matsuya et al., 2009).
Therefore, we expected to find that denosomin induces
axonal growth in the lesion site in SCI.
In the present study, we investigated the in vivo activities
of denosomin in SCI mice and the underlying mechanism for
its effects on axonal growth in the detrimental environment
of injured spinal cord. Our results demonstrated that deno-
somin increases astrocyte density in the injured region of SCI
mice and is able to convert one property of reactive astrocytes
into a stimulant for axonal growth. We also clarified that
denosomin-induced expression and secretion of the interme-
diate filament protein, vimentin, in astrocytes enhanced
axonal growth and functional recovery in SCI mice. Altering
the roles of astrocytes by medication may prove to be a very
effective route for achieving SCI recovery and should be the
focus of new therapeutic intervention strategies.
Methods
All studies involving animals are reported in accordance with
the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving
animals (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath et al., 2010). All
experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide-
lines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at the
Sugitani Campus of the University of Toyama and the NIH
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The
Committee for Animal Care and Use at the Sugitani Campus
of the University of Toyama approved each of the study
protocols. All efforts were made to minimize the number of
animals used.
Animals and SCI model experiments
Seven-week-old male ddY mice (SLC) were used for the SCI
experiments (total number of mice used = 50). The mice were
housed with ad libitum access to food and water and were
maintained under constant environmental conditions (22 
2°C, 50  5% humidity and 12 h light : 12 h dark cycle start-
ing at 07 h 00 min). The mice were anaesthetized by admin-
istration of trichloroacetaldehyde monohydrate (500
mg·kg-1, i.p.). After the mice had completely lost their right-
ing reflex, the surgical operations to produce SCI were per-
formed, as described previously (Krenz and Weaver, 2000)
with slight modifications. Contusion injuries were produced
by twice dropping a 6.5 g weight from a height of 3 cm onto
the exposed dura mater of the lumbar spinal cord L1 level
using a stereotaxic instrument (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). One
hour after surgery, the SCI mice were randomly divided into
the vehicle-treated and denosomin-treated groups, and appli-
cation of the drug was initiated. Denosomin at 10 mmol·kg-1
(Figure 3A–D) or 20 mmol·kg-1 (Figures 2, 3E–H and 8–10) or a
vehicle control was administered p.o. once daily to the
animals for 7 days (Figures 8–10) or 14 days (Figures 2 and 3).
For behavioural scoring, the mice were individually placed in
an open field (23.5 cm ¥ 16.5 cm ¥ 12.5 cm) and observed for
5 min. Open-field locomotion was evaluated using the 0–9-
point Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) locomotion scale and the
0–4-point Body Support Scale (BSS) locomotion scale.

a 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) monoclonal antibody
(clone: Mobu-1, dilution 1:500; Merck Calbiochem, Darm-
stadt, Germany). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa
Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (dilution
1:300), Alexa Fluor 350-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (dilu-
tion 1:300), Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1
(dilution 1:300) and Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:300; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,USA).
Immunohistochemistry
After behavioural scoring, serial spinal cord slices were
obtained as 10 mm sagittal sections to determine the expres-
sion therein of NF-H, GFAP, vimentin, 5-HT, CSPG, laminin
and b-actin; and these samples were also counterstained with
DAPI (Biomol, Farmingdale, NY, USA). The fluorescent images
shown in Figure 3A, C and E were captured at 320 mm ¥
420 mm or 1600 mm ¥ 2100 mm using a fluorescence micro-
scope (BX-61/DP70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The densities of
NF-H-positive axons and GFAP-positive astrocytes were meas-
ured using an ATTO densitography image analyser (ATTO,
Tokyo, Japan). Ten randomly selected 100 mm ¥ 100 mm
squares in the centres of the lesions or adjacent to the lesions
were measured to calculate the average value per slice
(Figure 3B and D). The fluorescent images in Figure 3E–Gwere
captured at distances of 2 mm rostral and caudal from the
injury centre (Figure 3I) at 1600 mm ¥ 2100 mmusing a BX-61/
DP70microscope. The fluorescent images in Figures 8–10were
captured at 106 mm ¥ 142 mm (Figure 8) or at 670 mm ¥ 890 mm
(Figures 9 and 10) using a fluorescence microscopy system
(Axio observer Z1, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The
densities of the 5-HT-, vimentin-, GFAP- and CSPG-positive
areas inside of the scar were determined using the ImageJ
image analyser (NIH). An observer, blind to the different
treatments, determined the threshold values and ROIs
(Figures 3F,G, 9 and 10). The GFAP-positive regions (Figure 3)
and CSPG-positive regions (Figures 9 and 10) of the scar were
then quantified.
Primary culture
Primary cultured spinal cord and cerebral cortical cells were
prepared from the E17-18 embryos of 30 Sprague–Dawley rats
(SLC, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) at a density of 1.45–1.74
¥ 105 cells·cm-2 or E14 embryos of three ddY mice (SLC) at a
density of 1.45–4.35 ¥ 104 cells·cm-2 (Figure 7I–K) as described
previously (Kuboyama et al., 2005) with modifications.
Neurons and astrocytes coexisted in our culture conditions
(data not shown). The cells were cultured in eight-well
chamber slides (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cortical and
spinal cell cultures were given Neurobasal medium (Invitro-
gen) containing 2% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.6%
D-glucose and 2 mM L-glutamine. Axonal densities were ana-
lysed by immunocytochemistry for pNF-H and MAP2 follow-
ing Denosomin (Matsuya et al., 2009) or vimentin (ProSpec,
Rehovot, Israel) treatment.
Rat spinal cord astrocytes were cultured as described pre-
viously (McCarthy anddeVellis, 1980)withmodifications. Rat
spinal cord cells (E17-18) were cultured for 12–14 days with
shaking in T-25 flasks (Falcon) in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium
(Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS. Microglia and oligodendro-
cyte precursor cells were detached by shaking. Immunocyto-
chemistry indicated that the percentage of GFAP-positive
astrocytes was greater than 95% using our procedure, and the
remaining cells weremicroglia. Purified astrocytes were seeded
in eight-well chamber slides coated with 5 mg·mL-1 poly-D-
lysine (PDL) at a density of 0.72–1.45 ¥ 105 cells·cm-2. T-25
flaskswere coatedwith 5 mg·mL-1 PDL. The eight-well chamber
slides were coated with 5 mg·mL-1 PDL following treatment
with 0.5 mg·mL-1 aggrecan (Sigma), which is a CSPG (Figure 7J
and K). Fluorescent images were captured at 670 mm ¥ 890 mm
using the BX61/DP70 microscope. Axons were automatically
detected by the Neurocyte image analyser (Kurabo, Osaka,
Japan), and the densities of axons per neuron were calculated.
An observer, blind to the different treatments, captured and
analysed the images (Figure 7I and K).
BrdU incorporation assay
Cellular proliferation was evaluated using the BrdU incorpo-
ration assay. BrdU (Sigma) was added to the culture medium
for 24 h at a final concentration of 10 mM. The cells were
incubated in 2 M HCl for 20 min at 37°C after fixation and
were washed in 0.1 M borate buffer. The cells were immunos-
tained for BrdU and counterstained with DAPI.
TUNEL assay
H2O2 (at a final concentration of 300 mM) was added to the
astrocyte culture medium for 24 h. The proportion of cells
that exhibited cellular death was determined using the In Situ
Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cell migration assay
Isolated astrocytes were cultured until fully confluent (a state
of growth arrest) for 7 days to avoid the influence of cell
proliferation activity. The central part of the astroglial layer
was then scratched using a 1.5 mL Pipette tip. The scratched
cell-free area was observed for 3 days after the scratch wound
and was recorded with a phase-contrast microscope. Subse-
quently, astrocytes were immunostained for GFAP and coun-
terstained with DAPI.
ELISA for vimentin
Cultured rat astrocytes were treated with vehicle solution or
1 mM denosomin for 5 days in DMEM/F12 (1:1) containing
BJPRecovery from SCI via vimentin secretion

10% FBS, and the astrocytes were treated for 1 day with
denosomin-free and serum-free neurobasal medium. Condi-
tioned medium (ACM) and astrocyte lysates were collected
individually. The cells were lysed using a lysis buffer (pH 7.5,
140 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl, 1% NP-40, 10 mM EDTA,
20 mM NaF, 20 mM b-glycerophosphate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM
DTT, 1 mM sodium vanadate and a protease inhibitor cock-
tail; Roche). The vimentin concentrations in these samples
were quantified using a rat vimentin ELISA kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Cusabio Biotech, Wuhan, Hubei,
China).
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons were performed using a one-way
ANOVA followed by the post hoc Dunnett’s test, or using a
repeated measures two-way ANOVA followed by the post hoc
Bonferroni test and an unpaired (two-tailed) t-test. The Prism
5 (GraphPad software) programme was used for the statistical
analyses. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. The
mean values of the data are presented along with the SEM.
Results
Administration of denosomin, p.o., induced
increases in astrocytes, axonal growth and
functional recovery in SCI mice
Mice with contusion SCI were administered denosomin, p.o.,
for 14 consecutive days following injury. Motor function of
two hind limbs was separately scored using the BMS, which
evaluates ankle movement and walking stability (Basso et al.,
2006) (Figure 2A), along with criteria we developed to assess
the degree of hind limb muscle strength for support of the
body trunk, that is the BSS (see Table 1 and Figure 2B). Most
SCI mice displayed complete bilateral hind limb paralysis the
day after injury. Denosomin-treated SCI mice displayed
improvements in hind limb function during the first week. At
14 days after the SCI, denosomin-treated mice showed high
mobility of their hind limb ankles during walking, but
vehicle-treated mice had little movement in their ankles
(Figure 2C; Supporting Information Movies S1,S2). The BMS
and BSS scores of denosomin-treated mice gradually and sig-
nificantly increased compared with control SCI mice over the
14 day course of administration (Figure 2A and B). We
repeated these experiments were repeated more than three
times and confirmed that a similar degree of motor dysfunc-
tion was reproducibly observed in our contusion model. The
pattern of spontaneous recovery of the motor function,
which reached a plateau (2–3 in BMS score) at 14 days after
the injury, and the effectiveness of denosomin were also
reproducible (data not shown). Denosomin administration
did not affect the body weight or induce abnormal behav-
iours in mice (data not shown).
The injured spinal cords of denosomin-treated (for 14
days) SCI mice were then histologically examined. In vehicle-
treated SCI mice, NF-H (an axonal marker)-positive staining
showed that axons were lost around the centre of the lesion
and its surroundings (Figure 3A). The areas of NF-H-positive
axons were measured in the centre of the lesion and the
adjacent locations (Figure 3I). Axonal density was signifi-
cantly increased in both the lesion centres and the adjacent
sections in the spinal cords of denosomin-treated SCI mice
(Figure 3B). Next, spinal cord slices were immunostained
for 5-HT (Figure 3E–G), which is a marker of the 5-
hydroxytryptaminergic raphespinal tract in the spinal cord,
because the raphespinal tract largely regulates locomotive
function (Jacobs et al., 2002). The 5-HT-positive areas were
measured in the caudal and rostral regions at a distance of
2 mm from the injury centre (Figure 3I). The caudal 5-HT-
positive axonal densities of animals in the denosomin group
were greater than those of the vehicle group (Figure 3G), but
the densities on the rostral sides did not differ notably
(Figure 3F). At 7 days after denosomin administration, 5-HT-
positive axons were increased in the lesion region but were
rarely observed at the caudal site of the injury region
(Figure 9A). These results suggest denosomin induces the
axons in the glial scar (at least those in the raphespinal tracts)
to elongate and towards the caudal site. Immunostaining for
GFAP was performed to identify reactive astrocytes (Figure 3C
and D). GFAP-positive astrocytes in SCI control mice were
localized to the areas adjacent to the lesions. In contrast,
GFAP-positive astrocytes in denosomin-treated SCI mice were
located at the centre of the lesions as well as in areas adjacent
to the lesions (Figure 3C). The sizes of the glial scars were not
different between the control and denosomin-treated SCI
mice (Figure 3H). The marked increment in GFAP-positive
astrocytes in the lesion centre was significantly enhanced by
denosomin administration (Figure 3D).
Denosomin increased astrocyte proliferation
and reduced oxidative stress-induced astrocyte
death but did not increase astrocyte migration
To assess the effect of denosomin treatment on astrocytes
within the scar of SCI mice, astrocyte proliferation was inves-
tigated in pure cultures of astrocytes isolated from rat spinal
cords. The astrocytes were cultured with denosomin. Six days
later, BrdU incorporation, for 24 h, was assessed to evaluate
any increases in astroglial proliferation. The number of BrdU-
positive astrocytes was significantly increased after deno-
somin treatment (Figure 4A and B), and the total number
of astrocytes also increased (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the
growth rate of astrocytes and the ratio of BrdU-positive astro-

cytes to DAPI-positive astrocytes both significantly increased
in response to denosomin (Figure 4D).
The primary mechanical damage associated with SCI is
followed by a secondary injury phase that involves oxidative
stress, inflammation and cell death (Rowland et al., 2008;
Olby, 2010). Thus, the effect of denosomin on astrocyte sur-
vival was investigated. Astrocyte death was induced in vitro by
addition of H2O2 and it was then assessed using the TUNEL
assay (Figure 5). Denosomin treatment was started 24 h
before the addition of H2O2, and the TUNEL assays were
performed at 24 h after the addition of H2O2. In untreated
control astrocytes, almost no TUNEL-positive dead astrocytes
were observed with or without denosomin treatment. In con-
trast, H2O2 treatment resulted in a significant increase in the
number of TUNEL-positive astrocytes. Moreover, denosomin
pretreatment of H2O2-treated astrocytes markedly and signifi-
cantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive astrocytes
(Figure 5A and B). Denosomin significantly decreased the
death rate of H2O2-treated astrocytes and the ratio of TUNEL-
positive astrocytes to DAPI-positive astrocytes (Figure 5C).
The promotion of astrocyte migration from outside of the
scar is another possible explanation for the increase in astro-
cytes within the scar. Thus, an in vitro migration assay was
performed (Figure 6). The number of astrocytes migrating
into the scratched space (scar) did not differ in the presence
or absence of denosomin.
Denosomin enhanced the secretion of
vimentin from astrocytes, leading to
axonal elongation
Reactive astrocytes in the glial scar are a major impediment to
axonal regrowth (Davies et al., 1997; Silver and Miller, 2004;
Tom et al., 2004; Yiu and He, 2006). However, axonal growth
and reactive astrogliosis were enhanced in the lesion centres
of denosomin-treated SCI mice (Figure 3), and similar phe-
nomena were observed in denosomin-treated cultured cells
(Figures 4, 5, Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2).
Therefore, we hypothesized that the denosomin-induced
increase in astrocytes does not inhibit axonal growth but
rather assists in axonal crossing of the lesion scar. To inves-
tigate this hypothesis, spinal cord cells were cultured in
denosomin-free medium and were also co-cultured with iso-
lated denosomin-treated astrocytes (Figure 7C). The axonal
densities of spinal cord neurons layered on denosomin-
treated astrocytes were significantly increased when they

were not given direct denosomin stimulation (Figure 7A and
B). Next, we investigated the dependence of astrocyte-
mediated axonal outgrowth on astrocyte secretion. Cultured
spinal cord cells were treated with astrocyte-conditioned
medium (ACM) from astrocyte cultures that had been treated
with denosomin for 6 days (Figure 7F). The axonal densities
of the cultured spinal cord cells that were treated with
denosomin-untreated, ACM for 6 days increased compared
with those treated with control (non-ACM) medium
(Figure 7D). Furthermore, denosomin-pretreated ACM sig-
nificantly increased the axonal densities compared with the
denosomin-untreated ACM group. The neuron number and
non-neuronal cell number were not changed by the
denosomin-pretreated ACM, (Figure 7E). These results dem-
onstrate that denosomin-treated astrocytes secrete some
factors that stimulate axonal elongation.
To identify the proteins that stimulated axonal elonga-
tion, the levels of astrocyte protein expression were exhaus-
tively compared between the denosomin- and vehicle-treated
astrocytes using two-dimensional (2D) PAGE (Supporting
Information Figure S3) and LC-MS/MS analyses. These analy-
ses revealed that levels of the intermediate filament protein
vimentin notably increased in denosomin-treated astrocytes,
and vimentin was found to produce the most dense band on
the 2D-PAGE. An ELISA analysis further confirmed the
increased vimentin levels in denosomin-treated astrocytes
(Figure 7G). There were also increased vimentin levels in the
ACM of denosomin-treated astrocytes (Figure 7H). The
vimentin content in control astrocytes was 3.99 ng·mL-1
compared with 17.4 ng·mL-1 in denosomin-treated astro-
cytes. Calibration by protein concentrations showed vimen-
tin concentrations were 0.55 ng·mg-1 protein and 1.93 ng·mg-1

protein in cortical ACM and denosomin-treated ACM respec-
tively. This indicates that the ratio of vimentin to total pro-
teins in ACM was increased by denosomin, suggesting that it
induces the secretion of vimentin.
In vivo, the distribution of vimentin primarily overlapped
that of laminin, an extracellular matrix protein, inside the
glial scars of denosomin-treated SCI mice (Figure 8A). The
vimentin-positive areas also appeared to be outside b-actin
(Figure 8B), which is a cytoplasmic protein that is also dis-
tributed at the plasma membrane (Hoock et al., 1991). These
distribution patterns strongly suggest that vimentin was
being secreted in the spinal cord in vivo. Vimentin secretion
from astrocytes (Greco et al., 2010; Cordero-Llana et al., 2011)
and macrophages (Mor-Vaknin et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2004)
has been reported previously. It has been proposed that
vimentin interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membrane and is selectively exported from the ER to the
Golgi complex and then secreted (Mor-Vaknin et al., 2003;
Huet et al., 2006). However, the functional significance of
vimentin secretion with respect to neuronal activity is not
known. The direct application of vimentin resulted in
increase in axonal densities at 10 ng·mL-1 in primary cultured
cortical neurons (Figure 7I), which was consistent with the
concentration of vimentin in the ACM treated with deno-
somin (Figure 7H). Vimentin (10 ng·mL-1) also significantly
increased axonal densities even on inhibitory CSPG-coated
slides (Figure 7J and K). These results are very important,
because CSPG is deposited inside the glial scar and generally
inhibits axonal regeneration in SCIs (Silver and Miller, 2004).
Together, these results indicate that denosomin treatment
increases vimentin expression and secretion by astrocytes,
which then leads to the promotion of axonal growth.

astrocyte frequency and axonal growth along

Denosomin-mediated axonal outgrowth in primary cultures is mediated by vimentin secretion from astrocytes. (A–C) Isolated astrocytes were

denosomin for 7 days after the astrocytes had been treated with denosomin. (D–F) Isolated astrocytes were cultured in the presence or absence
of 1 mM denosomin (Pre-Deno) for 6 days. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh medium without denosomin, and the medium was

been treated with denosomin for 7 days were immunostained
for 5-HT and vimentin (Figure 9). The sizes of CSPG-positive
glial scar areas were not significantly different between SCI
control and denosomin-treated SCI mice (Figure 9C). The
level of CSPG expressed was also not changed by denosomin
(Figure 9D). Denosomin administration significantly in-
creased the frequency of 5-HT-positive (Figure 9E) and
vimentin-positive areas (Figure 9F) within the scar. Addition-
ally, 5-HT axons were elongated along the scar rim where
vimentin was highly expressed (Figure 9A). In control mice,
5-HT-positive axons rarely overlapped with vimentin-positive
regions. In contrast, the majority of 5-HT-positive axons were
co-localized with vimentin in denosomin-treated mice
(Figure 9B). The frequency of 5-HT axons associating with
vimentin significantly increased in the denosomin-treated
group (Figure 9G). These results indicate that denosomin
enhanced the raphespinal tract growth inside the scar, and
this growth was probably due to an association of the raphe-
spinal tracts with secreted vimentin or vimentin-positive
cells.
The promotion and inhibition of axonal growth by reac-
tive astrocytes has previously been well characterized (Silver
and Miller, 2004; Okada et al., 2006; Yiu and He, 2006; Rolls
et al., 2009; White et al., 2011). To clarify that the conversion
of astrocyte function relates to vimentin expression, spinal
cord slices were immunostained for vimentin, CSPG and
GFAP (Figure 10). Regions expressing vimentin mainly over-
lapped with GFAP-positive astrocytes along the scar rim
(Figure 10A). Denosomin treatment significantly increased
the frequency of astrocytes that were positive for GFAP and
vimentin (Figure 10B and C), whereas this treatment did not
significantly increase the frequency of astrocytes that were
positive for CSPG and GFAP (Figure 10B and D). As shown in
Figure 3C and D, denosomin increased the density of astro-
cytes in the scar. These findings suggest that denosomin spe-
cifically increases vimentin-positive astrocytes to promote
axonal growth. However, denosomin did not affect the fre-
quency of CSPG-positive astrocytes, which inhibit axonal
growth.
Discussion and conclusions
We previously demonstrated that a novel compound, deno-
somin, has the potential to promote axonal growth and
attenuate neuronal loss under the amyloid b(1–42)-induced
neurodegenerative condition in primary cultured cortical
neurons coexisting with astrocytes (Matsuya et al., 2009).

Herein, we showed that denosomin can facilitate axonal
elongation in primary cultured cortical neurons (Supporting
Information Figure S1) and spinal cord neurons (Supporting
Information Figure S2), and that denosomin also has in vivo
activities (Figures 2, 3, 9 and 10). Specifically, denosomin
facilitated the growth of axons in the injured region and
improved hind limb dysfunction in SCI mice. Denosomin
treatment for 7 days increased the number of 5-HT-positive
axons in the lesion scar (Figure 9). Further, donosomin treat-
ment for 14 days significantly increased 5-HT-positive axons
in the caudal region, at a distance of 2 mm from the injury
centre (Figure 3E and G). Although the axonal growth

induced by denosomin in the relatively early phase may be
mainly due to axonal sprouting, any extension beyond the
lesion centre might be due to regeneration. Although the
effects of denosomin on the BMS and BSS scores were only
significant in the late phase (11–14 days after SCI), these
scores also tended to be improved in denosomin-treated mice
at early phase. Hence, the possibility that the neuroprotective
effect of denosomin may be involved in the early phase event
needs to be investigated further. We also showed that deno-
somin increases the expression (Figure 7G) and secretion
(Figure 7H) of vimentin from astrocytes and the ratio of astro-
cytes that expressed vimentin (Figure 10C), which functions
as an axon growth facilitator. Hence, our results indicate that
administration of denosomin, p.o., induces secretion of

vimentin from astrocytes, axonal growth beyond the inhibi-
tory glial scar and recovery of hind limb function in SCI mice
(Figure 11). These also suggest a new astroglial function in the
injured spinal cord, as they show that the astrocyte supports
axonal growth via secretion of vimentin.
In the past, reactive astrocytes, by secreting inhibitory
CSPG in the injured region of SCI, were considered to impede
axonal regeneration (Silver and Miller, 2004; Yiu and He,
2006). Recently, however, it has been gradually accepted that
the glial scar also has beneficial effects on CNS repair (Rolls
et al., 2009; White et al., 2011). If the properties of astrocytes
in the scar can be converted into beneficial ones, the scar
would additionally support axonal growth. Vimentin as well
as GFAP is the up-regulated hallmark of reactive gliosis. In
animals in which vimentin has been knocked down, the size
of the glial scar in SCI was found to be reduced (Xia et al.,
2008; Toyooka et al., 2011). However, neurite length and sur-
vival of cultured cortical neurons were not influenced by
vimentin knockout (Menet et al., 2001) or knockdown
(Desclaux et al., 2009) unlike to GFAP. In addition, knockout
of vimentin did not induce axon regeneration in SCI mice
(Menet et al., 2003). Thus, the role of vimentin in the pro-
pensity of astrocytes to induce axonal growth was not
obvious. In our study, we showed that the ratio of vimentin-
positive astrocytes was approximately 30% in control SCI
mice and this was greatly increased by denosomin to ap-
proximately 80% (Figure 10E). Denosomin treatment also
enhanced the vimentin concentration in cultured astrocytes
(Figure 7F). The ratio of 5-HT axons associated with vimentin
was significantly increased in the injured region of
denosomin-treated SCI mice (Figure 9E). We also clarified
that vimentin has an axonal elongation activity even in the
presence of CSPG (Figure 7J and K). These results suggest that
denosomin increases the concentration of vimentin in GFAP-
positive astrocytes and this is associated with the growth of
axons in the injured region of SCI mice. Other groups have
reported that axonal growth is associated with vimentin-
positive cells in the injured region of the spinal cord (Hsu and
Xu, 2005; Busch et al., 2010). Therefore, an increase in the
expression of vimentin would support SCI repair.
Figure 11
Schema for the effects of denosomin. Oral administration of denosomin to SCI mice induces proliferation of astrocytes, inhibits oxidative
stress-induced astrocytic death and increases the vimentin expression in astrocytes. As a result, vimentin-positive astrocytes were increased, then
vimentin secretion is enhanced. Secreted vimentin probably induces elongation of 5HT-positive axons, leading to hind limb motor functional
recovery of SCI mice.

During development, astrocytic vimentin facilitates the
guidance of outgrowing corticospinal tracts (Joosten and
Gribnau, 1989). Vimentin levels are known to increase after
contusive injury in the spinal cord, and this increase was
thought to contribute to axonal growth during spontaneous
recovery (Bareyre and Schwab, 2003). Vimentin is also
secreted from macrophages (Mor-Vaknin et al., 2003; Xu
et al., 2004) as well as astrocytes (Greco et al., 2010; Cordero-
Llana et al., 2011). Also, NG2 cells in the injured spinal cord
have been reported to be positive for vimentin (Busch et al.,
2010). Although we have not investigated whether deno-
somin has an effect on macrophages and NG2 cells, our data
suggest that, at least in astrocytes, denosomin induces the
secretion of vimentin. However, the role and mechanism of
this secreted vimentin are still not known. Although, in an
ongoing study we showed that vimentin, applied to the
extracellular space, elicits the phosphorylation of several sig-
nalling factors in neurons (data not shown) and propose that
vimentin works like a neurotrophic factor or an adhesive
factor.
We synthesized denosomin as a derivative of sominone
(Matsuya et al., 2009) and sominone has been found to phos-
phorylate RET (a receptor for glial cell line-derived neuro-
trophic factor, GDNF) in neurons without increasing the
synthesis and secretion of GDNF (Tohda and Joyashiki, 2009).
Hence, RET should be considered as a candidate for mediat-
ing the effect of denosomin in astrocytes. However, the
expression of RET was not detected in astrocytes in the spinal
cord (Ryu et al., 2011). In addition, we found no expression of
RET in astrocytes in the injured spinal cords or in naïve spinal
cords (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that RET is
responsible for the signalling of denosomin in astrocytes.
Denosomin enhances proliferation, reduces oxidative stress-
induced death and promotes vimentin expression in astro-
cytes, leading to an increase in the number of astrocytes
secreting vimentin. The secreted vimentin then probably
induces axonal growth in the injured spinal cord. Other
groups have reported that STAT3 (Okada et al., 2006) and
TGF-a (White et al., 2011) signalling mediate both astrocyte
proliferation and migration in SCI to enhance the healing
process. However, denosomin did not affect the cellular
migration of isolated astrocytes. Although the ephrin
(EPHA4) receptor-mediated RhoA pathway leads to astrocyte
proliferation and reactivity (Goldshmit et al., 2004), EPHA4
signalling should also enhance astrocyte migration (Goldsh-
mit and Bourne, 2010). Down-regulation experiments have
indicated that vimentin is associated with astrocyte migra-
tion (Desclaux et al., 2009), but the possibility that an
increase in vimentin enhances astrocyte migration has not
been clarified. Therefore, we think that denosomin increases
vimentin without influencing astrocyte migration. We
hypothesize that denosomin signalling affects astrocytes
through a distinct pathway, in which STAT3, TGF-a and
EPHA4 are not possibly involved . In addition to inducing
astrocyte proliferation and vimentin up-regulation, deno-
somin is also neuroprotective (Matsuya et al., 2009) and has
astrocyte-protective effects (Figure 5), which suggests that
denosomin has multiple beneficial effects for SCI repair.
Whether all these effects of denosomin are mediated by
vimentin, and the identity of its signalling pathway, are the
subjects of further investigations.
The increase in reactive astrocytes associated with SCI was
thought to be essentially a physical and functional barrier
inhibiting axonal regeneration. However, the upregulation
and secretion of vimentin converts this burden into a force
for functional SCI recovery. Several pharmacotherapies for
SCI are in clinical trials (Tohda and Kuboyama, 2011), but
drug candidates that utilize the beneficial effects of reactive
astrocytes have not been identified. Thus, denosomin, by
increasing the expression and secretion of vimentin, has the
potential to be used to convert the role of reactive astrocytes
from one of impeding axonal growth to one of stimulating
growth. This study is the first to demonstrate the beneficial
role of vimentin in SCI and drug-mediated regulation of
reactive astrocytes.

Figure S1 Denosomin enhances axonal outgrowth in
primary cerebrocortical cultures. Rat primary cultured cer-
ebrocortical cells were cultured in the presence or absence of
1 mMdenosomin (Deno) for 6 days. Subsequently, the cortical
neurons were immunostained for pNF-H and MAP2 and
counterstained with DAPI (A). The densities of pNF-H-
positive axons per neuron were quantified (B). The distribu-
tion of neurons and non-neuronal cells per 0.1 mm2 was
evaluated by the quantification of MAP2- and DAPI-positive
cells (C). MAP2- and DAPI-positive cells were defined as
neurons. MAP2-negative and DAPI-positive cells were defined
as non-neuronal cells. *P < 0.05, Student’s unpaired t-test
(two-tailed). N.S., not significant. The numbers of photos are
bracketed in columns. The scale bar indicates 100 mm.
Figure S2 Denosomin enhances axonal outgrowth and the
proliferation of non-neuronal cells in primary spinal cord
cultures. (A, B) Rat primary cultured spinal cord cells were
cultured in the presence or absence of 1 mM denosomin
(Deno) for 4 days. Subsequently, the spinal cord neurons were
immunostained for pNF-H (A) and MAP2. The densities of the
pNF-H-positive axons per neuron were quantified (B). (C–F)
Five days after treatment with or without 1 mM denosomin
(Deno), BrdU was applied to the spinal cord cells for 24 h.
Subsequently, the cells were immunostained for MAP2 and
BrdU and counterstained with DAPI (C). Cellular distribu-
tions of neurons and non-neuronal cells per 0.1 mm2 were
evaluated by the quantification of MAP2- and DAPI-positive
cells (D). The proliferation of non-neuronal cells was evalu-
ated by the quantification of BrdU-positive and MAP2-
negative cells (E). The growth rate of non-neuronal cells was
evaluated by the ratio of BrdU-positive cells to MAP2-
negative cells (F). Arrows indicate the proliferating non-
neuronal cells. *P < 0.05, Student’s unpaired t-test (two-
tailed). The numbers of photos are shown in parentheses in
the columns. The scale bar indicates 100 mm.
Figure S3 2D-PAGE analysis reveals a dense spot increased
by denosomin treatment in cultured astrocytes. (A, B) Cul-
tured rat astrocytes were treated with vehicle solution or
1 mM denosomin for 6 days. After the cells were lysed, the
lysates were degenerated and analysed with 2D-PAGE. (B)
Enlarged images were in insets in (A). The spots enclosed in
dashed line in (B) were digested with trypsin and analysed
with LC/MS/MS. The spots were identified as rat vimentin
(NP_112402) by the Mascot Search (protein sequence cover-
age: 43%; Matrix Science).
