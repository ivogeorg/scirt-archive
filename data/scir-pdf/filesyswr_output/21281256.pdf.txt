humans: an overview of current
clinical trials and their potential
effects on intrinsic CNS
macrophages

Introduction: Macrophage activation is a hallmark of spinal cord injury (SCI)
pathology. CNS macrophages, derived from resident microglia and blood
monocytes, are ubiquitous throughout the injured spinal cord, and respond
to signals in the lesion environment by changing their phenotype and func-
tion. Depending on their phenotype and activation status, macrophages
may initiate secondary injury mechanisms and/or promote CNS regeneration
and repair.
Areas covered: This review provides a comprehensive overview of current SCI
clinical trials that are intended to promote neuroprotection, axon regenera-
tion or cell replacement. None of these potential therapies were developed
with the goal of influencing macrophage function; however, it is likely that
each will have direct or indirect effects on CNS macrophages. The potential
impact of each trial is discussed in the context of CNS macrophage biology.
Expert opinion: Activation of CNS macrophages is an inevitable consequence
of traumatic SCI. Given that these cells are exquisitely sensitive to changes in
microenvironment, any intervention that affects tissue integrity and/or the
composition of the cellular milieu will undoubtedly affect CNS macrophages.
Thus, it is important to understand how current clinical trials will affect
intrinsic CNS macrophages.

1. Introduction
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) occurs following mechanical compression or
rupture of the spinal cord. Although protective devices and preventative measures
have helped to reduce the risk of SCI, few options exist for minimizing the cell
death and loss of function caused by trauma-induced ischemia, apoptosis, excitotox-
icity and inflammation [1]. Because most (if not all) of these secondary injury mech-
anisms can be initiated and/or coordinated by cellular and humoral mediators of the
immune system, it is important to understand how current or planned therapies
influence inflammatory cascades, even if inflammation is not the designated thera-
peutic target. Such considerations are perhaps best centered on activated microglia
and monocyte-derived macrophages (collectively referred to as CNS macrophages).
Indeed, CNS macrophages are a pathological hallmark of all forms of mammalian
SCI [1,2].
Once activated, CNS macrophages exert conflicting effects on CNS tissue; they
can facilitate regeneration and repair through the release of trophic cues and/or

growth factors or contribute to secondary cell death by releas-
ing toxins, proteases and cytokines [3-12]. These divergent
effects of CNS macrophages were recently shown to be associ-
ated with unique molecular phenotypes that are regulated
by cues in the lesion environment [13]. Macrophage effector
functions are dynamic and can change in response to new
stimuli in the lesion microenvironment [14,15]. It is therefore
important to consider how different therapies will alter
the microenvironment and influence CNS macrophages
after SCI.
The goal of this review is to highlight current SCI clinical
trials that test therapies designated as neuroprotective, axon
regenerative or cell transplantation/replacement then discuss
how these therapies could influence macrophage activation
and function. Federal and privately-funded double-blinded
clinical trials are the primary focus. Pre-clinical/basic science
interventions will be discussed briefly. For systematic reviews
of current preclinical data for SCI therapies see [16-18]. For a
review of previous clinical trials and ongoing, but not
double-blinded trials, see [19]. ClinicalTrials.gov was used as
the primary source to identify clinical trials. Data gathered
from clinicaltrials.gov are used in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the website and the ClinicalTrials.gov ID
numbers (CTID) are reported when available.
2. Neuroprotective therapies
Neuroprotective therapies attempt to promote the survi-
val of neurons, glia and endothelia that are not immedi-
ately destroyed by mechanical trauma. Many pre-clinical
neuroprotective strategies have emerged as putative
clinical therapies.
2.1 Current neuroprotective therapies
Currently, there are six neuroprotective therapies being
tested in clinical trials for SCI. Five are drug treatments
(methylprednisolone, minocycline, erythropoietin, Riluzole,
and HP-184) and one trial is evaluating the effects of systemic
hypothermia. Methylprednisolone has already been tested in
clinical trials and is currently used as a ‘standard of care’ com-
parator for newer therapies in two clinical trials (see umbilical
cord mononuclear cell and erythropoietin trials below). The
neuroprotective effects of methylprednisolone have been
reviewed previously [19-21].
Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline derivative,
has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects [22]. Several
studies have shown it to be a promising candidate for treating
SCI, especially since minocycline is already used in humans
for other indications and can readily cross the blood--brain
barrier [17]. However, recent studies in rat models of SCI
failed to observe a neuroprotective effect of minocycline [23,24].
Whether benefits will be observed in people is not clear. One
ongoing trial, sponsored by the University of Calgary, is test-
ing the safety and tolerance of minocycline in acute SCI
patients [25] (CTID: NCT00559494).
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hematopoietic growth factor
involved in erythropoiesis and is produced mainly by the
kidney. Independent studies have shown that EPO also acts
as a neurotrophic factor and is important for neural develop-
ment [26]. The neuroprotective potential of EPO could be
attributed to its ability to reduce apoptosis and inflammation
and promote vascular repair (reviewed in [26]). These effects
would presumably benefit the injured spinal cord; however,
the use of EPO in rodent pre-clinical SCI models has pro-
duced conflicting data. Gorio et al. [27] were the first to report
the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of EPO in
preclinical SCI models but since then, a number of indepen-
dent studies, including one that was a formal replication,
failed to show any benefit of EPO or its derivatives [28-30].
An ongoing Phase III clinical trial is comparing acute
EPO administration to methylprednisolone in patients
with spinal shock [31] (Niguarda Hospital, Italy; CTID:
NCT00561067). The estimated completion date was
October 2010, but no updates are available.
The excess accumulation of intra-axonal sodium (Na+) ions
leads to cytotoxic cell edema, intracellular acidosis and reverse
activation of the Na+--Ca2+ exchanger; all have been impli-
cated as Na+-dependent mechanisms of secondary injury of
spinal cord white matter [32-36]. In experimental models of
SCI, selective blockade of Na+ channels is neuroprotec-
tive [33,37,38]. Two ongoing clinical trials will determine
whether blocking Na+ channels can facilitate recovery after
SCI in humans. Sanofi-Aventis sponsored a Phase II trial
examining oral HP184 (a Na+/K+ channel blocker) in patients
with chronic SCI [39] (CTID: NCT00093275). The trial was
completed in 2008 and anecdotal reports by trial participants
suggest that HP184 improves motor and autonomic func-
tion [40] however, no official data have been released or
published. An independent Phase I trial will test the safety
and pharmacokinetics of Riluzole in acute SCI [41] (CTID:
NCT00876889). Preclinical data indicate that Riluzole is
more effective than other Na+ channel blockers at promoting

recovery after SCI [37]. The Riluzole clinical trial started in
April 2010 but no data are currently available.
Experimental and clinical data indicate that mild or
moderate hypothermia may be a promising neuroprotective
therapy for acute SCI (reviewed in [42]). Hypothermia may
work by reducing cellular metabolic demand, excitotoxicity,
vascular permeability, edema and/or inflammation [42].
A recent Phase I trial showed enhanced conversion rates
from American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) A to B, C
or D (~ 43%) without adverse complications in a small cohort
of cervical SCI patients that received moderate endovascular
cooling [43]. Details about the cooling techniques applied
to human SCI were published [44] and a Phase II trial is
pending [45].
2.2 The role of macrophages in neuroprotective
therapies
Pre-clinical data from independent laboratories indicate
that blocking or attenuating intraspinal accumulation of
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) promotes neuropro-
tection and enhances recovery after SCI [46-52]. Intravenous
injection of liposome-encapsulated clodronate selectively
depletes MDMs and macrophages in spleen and liver [46].
When applied to rodent models of SCI, clodronate liposomes
reduce lesion cavitation and axonal retraction at the site of
injury [46,52]. The efficacy of macrophage depletion can be
enhanced using combination therapies. For example, clodro-
nate liposomes were recently shown to synergize with Roli-
pram, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with neuroprotective
and axon growth promoting capabilities [51]. Post-injury
injection of anti-CD11d antibodies, specific for integrins
found on MDMs (and neutrophils), also limits recruitment
of MDMs to the injured spinal cord and improves motor,
sensory and autonomic function [48,53,54]. Because clodronate
liposomes and anti-CD11d antibodies are being tested clini-
cally for other indications, such as psoriasis, cancer and osteo-
porosis (CTIDs: NCT00877097 [55], NCT00009945 [56],
NCT00249808 [57]) it is surprising that neither has been
tested in clinical trials for SCI.
Since limiting the infiltration and activity of MDMs can
dramatically affect the outcome from SCI and because most
neuroprotective therapies can directly affect MDM and tissue
macrophage (e.g., microglia) function, it is important to
consider how existing neuroprotective therapies could affect
post-SCI macrophage responses.
Methylprednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid with
potent anti-inflammatory effects. When applied in pre-
clinical models of SCI, methylprednisolone reduces
neutrophil and MDM influx to sites of injury and limits
inflammatory signaling cascades [58,59]. However, the high
doses of methylprednisolone used in animals and people can
cause adverse systemic reactions that could obscure any
neuroprotective anti-inflammatory effects afforded by methyl-
prednisolone. For example, high dose methylprednisolone
increases the incidence of steroid myopathy and interstitial
pulmonary edema [60-62]. The anti-inflammatory and neuro-
protective effects can be improved and the adverse reactions
avoided by locally administering methylprednisolone to the
spinal cord. This was achieved recently via intraspinal delivery
of nanoparticles loaded with methylprednisolone [63].
In addition to its antibiotic properties, minocycline has
anti-inflammatory effects. When applied to models of SCI,
minocycline significantly reduces microglia and macrophage
activation [64]. These effects are associated with increased sur-
vival of oligodendrocytes, reduced lesion pathology, decreased
pain-like behavior and improved neurological function [64-69].
In vitro, minocycline has been shown to inhibit neurotoxic
nitric oxide release from glutamate-activated microglia [70].
Therefore, the observed effects associated with minocycline
treatment after SCI could be an indirect consequence of min-
ocycline improving neuron and glial survival by limiting the
toxic properties of activated MDMs and microglia [66-68].
This same relationship holds for hypothermia treatment.
After SCI, neutrophil influx and morphological indices of
microglial activation are reduced by systemic or epidural
hypothermia [71-73]. These changes occur in parallel with
improvements in neurological function; however, a direct
cause-effect relationship has not been confirmed.
Voltage gated sodium channels have been detected on mac-
rophages and expression of these channels increases as macro-
phages become activated [74]. In experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE, an experimental autoimmune dis-
ease of the brain and spinal cord) sodium channel blockers
reduce inflammatory cell accumulation in the spinal cord
by 75% and reduce phagocytosis, a functional property of
microglia/macrophages [75]. Future studies should determine
the effects of Riluzole and other sodium channel blockers on
microglia/macrophage function after SCI.
3. Regenerative therapies
Trauma to the spinal cord causes de novo synthesis of axon-
growth-inhibitory molecules at and nearby the site of injury.
When growing axons encounter these molecules, intracellular
signaling cascades are initiated that halt the advance of growth
cones and in most cases, the growth cones collapse and the
axons ‘die-back’ [76,77]. To date, most experimental and clini-
cal research has focused on understanding the growth-
inhibitory role of myelin proteins [e.g., myelin-associated
glycoprotein (MAG), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG) and neurite outgrowth inhibitor (Nogo)] and com-
ponents of extracellular matrix, namely chondroitin sulphate
proteoglycans (CSPGs) [78-80].
The goal of most regenerative therapies is to devise novel
ways to overcome these extrinsic barriers to endogenous
repair in an effort to improve functional recovery. Presently,
two approaches are being tested in clinical trials: i) appli-
cation of monoclonal antibodies to neutralize inhibitory
myelin proteins and ii) pharmacological manipulation of
growth-inhibitory signaling pathways.

3.1 Current regenerative therapies
Two clinical trials are testing the effects of exogenous anti-
myelin antibodies. The first, sponsored by Novartis [81]
(CTID: NCT00406016), is an international multi-center
trial with centers in the USA, Germany, Spain, Canada and
Switzerland. In these centers, the feasibility and safety of pro-
longed intrathecal or bolus injections of ATI355, an anti-
Nogo-A antibody, is being tested. Expected completion of
these trials is July 2011. The second trial, sponsored by
GlaxoSmithKline [82] (CTID: NCT00622609), examined
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of
various doses of intravenous GSK249320, an anti-MAG
monoclonal antibody, in healthy volunteers. The Phase I
safety trial was completed in April 2009 without any serious
adverse effects (for more details see [83]). GSK249320 is being
tested in Phase II trials as a treatment for stroke [84] (CTID:
NCT00833989).
Chondroitinase ABC (chABC) is a bacterial enzyme that
cleaves CSPGs. When applied to experimental models of
SCI, chABC attenuates inhibitory CSPG gradients and
enhances axon regeneration [85]. Although the safety and effi-
cacy of chABC preclinical data in experimental SCI is
compelling [18], especially when combined with other
interventions [86-91], chABC has not been applied to human
SCI. However, other types of chondroitinases have been
tested clinically (and more trials are ongoing) as treatments
for visual disorders without serious side effects [92]. Based on
the therapeutic potential of chABC, we mention it here and
discuss it below in the context of macrophage activation.
Cethrin and lithium are two drugs that have been used to
block signaling pathways that are associated with axon growth
inhibition after SCI. Both drugs may also confer neuropro-
tection [93,94]. Cethrin (BA-210), an antagonist of the
Rho GTPase, has been tested in two clinical trials spon-
sored by Alseres Pharmaceuticals. The first study (CTID:
NCT00500812) was completed in February 2009 [95].
Interim results indicate that Cethrin improved motor recovery
without serious adverse events [96]. A second, larger Phase II
trial was initiated in 2008 [97] (CTID: NCT00610337) but
was prematurely terminated because of insufficient funds [98].
Lithium blocks glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK-3b),
a serine/threonine kinase that inhibits axon growth [99].
Lithium-mediated inhibition of GSK-3b was shown to
increase the regenerative potential of CNS axons in animal
models of SCI [94]; however, recent data indicate that robust
suppression of GSK-3 also can impair axon regeneration [100].
Based on earlier data, oral lithium was (or is currently being)
tested in three clinical trials. A Phase I study [101] was initi-
ated in 2007 by the China Spinal Cord Network (CTID:
NCT00431171) to determine plasma levels of lithium after
oral administration in patients with chronic SCI. Results
from this study helped in the design of two larger Phase II tri-
als, also sponsored by the China Spinal Cord Network. The
first [102] (CTID: NCT00750061), started in 2008, tested
the safety and efficacy of oral lithium in chronic SCI patients.
Results from that study are pending. Because lithium was also
found to promote proliferation and differentiation of trans-
planted stem cells in experimental SCI models [103] a second
trial [104] was started in 2010 (CTID: NCT01046786) with
the goal of combining oral lithium with intraspinal transplan-
tation of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (see below
for review of stem cell trials). That study is in progress.
3.2 The role of macrophages in regenerative
therapies
In response to SCI, macrophages reportedly increase their
expression of MAG and Nogo receptors [105]. Activation of
the Nogo receptor (NgR) regulates immune cell motility
and it has been hypothesized that Nogo or MAG in intact
or newly synthesized myelin repels inflammatory macro-
phages via NgR activation [106,107]. Thus, in the injured spinal
cord, Nogo--NgR interactions could represent an endogenous
anti-inflammatory mechanism for limiting the spread of
potentially injurious macrophages beyond the site of injury.
If so, the efficacy of anti-Nogo antibody trials could be lim-
ited by a concurrent increase in intraspinal migration of mac-
rophages into spared tissue segments [106]. Indeed, de novo
synthesis of NgR expression on macrophages seems to corre-
late with enhanced phagocytosis and clearance of myelin in
injured peripheral nerves -- a presumed prerequisite for suc-
cessful axonal regeneration [108]. Additional research is needed
to determine the functional significance of engaging NgRs on
CNS macrophages.
Enzymatic digestion of CSPGs [e.g., via chondroitinase
ABC (chABC)] or other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteo-
glycans can increase the axon-growth-permissiveness of the
injured CNS microenvironment. However, these enzymatic
therapies may also improve axon plasticity, sprouting or
regeneration through indirect effects on microglia and macro-
phages [109]. Indeed, disaccharides from cleaved CSPGs
promote the activation of an anti-inflammatory microglial
phenotype in vitro [110]. It is not known if this also occurs
in vivo; however, chABC prevents macrophage-mediated
axonal retraction in the injured spinal cord [111]. After SCI,
retraction of injured CNS axons is associated with an
inflammatory ‘M1’ macrophage phenotype whereas anti-
inflammatory ‘M2’ macrophages promote axon growth
through CSPG barriers [13,53]. The interplay between CNS
macrophages and degradation products of the ECM and glial
scar is poorly understood but should be considered given that
clinical trials using chABC or similar enzymes are inevitable.
Cethrin promotes neuroprotection and axon regeneration
in part through the ability of one of its active components,
BA-210, to block Rho GTPase activity [93,112]. In macro-
phages, Rho GTPases affect a number of pro-inflammatory
functions, mostly through the regulation of NF-kB and
downstream signaling intermediates [113]. After SCI, Rho acti-
vation is increased in macrophages throughout the injury
site [114]. Whether intraspinal macrophage Rho GTPase
activity predicts a pro-inflammatory phenotype is not known;

however, pro-inflammatory macrophages contribute to a
range of processes associated with CNS injury and repair
including axonal dieback, sensory afferent sprouting and mye-
lin phagocytosis [13,52,115]. To optimize efficacy and facilitate
the interpretation of future pre-clinical and clinical trials, it
will be important to consider how Cethrin or other Rho
antagonists influence macrophage phenotype and function.
In macrophages, GSK3 regulates the balance of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokine synthesis [116]. When applied to
macrophages, lithium inhibits GSK3 and promotes the differ-
entiation of an M2 macrophage phenotype, even in the pres-
ence of pro-inflammatory stimuli [117,118]. As described above,
M2 macrophages could be neuroprotective and indeed,
GSK3 inhibitors minimize inflammatory toxicity in hippo-
campal slice cultures [118]. In experimental models of SCI,
lithium reduces macrophage accumulation in the injured
spinal cord suggesting that lithium also may influence the
migration and survival of microglia or monocyte-derived
macrophages [103]. Consistent with this hypothesis, long-
term exposure to lithium induces macrophage apoptosis [119].
Collectively, these data suggest that in addition to influencing
axon growth, lithium also may have profound immune
modulatory effects after SCI.
4. Cell replacement therapies
A variety of cell-based clinical trials have been completed or
are underway to test the feasibility and safety of using differ-
ent cell types to repair the injured spinal cord. Specifically,
autologous cells: macrophages and olfactory ensheathing cells;
and stem cells: bone marrow, embryonic or umbilical cord
blood-derived, are being developed as therapeutics for spinal
cord injury.
4.1 Autologous cells: macrophages (ProCord) and
olfactory ensheathing cells
The scientific rationale and design of the ProCord trials,
sponsored by Proneuron Biotechnologies, have been reviewed
in detail previously [120,121]; therefore, only a summary will be
provided here. ProCord is a proprietary procedure whereby
autologous macrophages are isolated from individuals with
SCI then are activated by co-incubating the cells with auto-
logous skin biopsies. Once activated, the macrophages are
surgically introduced into the injured spinal cord. Preclini-
cal data suggest that this approach produces macrophages
that confer neuroprotection and/or improve plasticity/
regeneration in the injured spinal cord [122]. The results of
the Phase I trial indicate that the cell preparation and surgical
technique are feasible and are without adverse effects [120].
A larger Phase II trial [123] was initiated in 2003 (CTID:
NCT00073853); however, the trial was suspended prema-
turely in 2006, reportedly because of financial limitations.
A recent paper documents issues of pragmatics, patient
recruitment and demographics for this trial [124]. It is not
known if or how the transplanted macrophages affected spinal
cord structure or function or if transplanted cells altered the
intrinsic macrophage response. The latter data cannot be
determined from the Phase II trial; however, analyses of safety
and efficacy data are in progress and will be reported
separately [Dr Dan Lammartse, pers. commun.].
Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are myelinating cells
found in close proximity to axons in the olfactory bulbs.
OECs have the functional and phenotypical characteristics
of astrocytes and Schwann cells. In pre-clinical models of
SCI, transplantation of OECs improves functional recovery,
axon growth/regeneration, remyelination and neuroprotec-
tion (for a review see [125]). Although the feasibility of OEC
transplantation in humans with SCI has been reported [126,127],
this approach remains controversial (see below and [125]).
Clinicaltrials.org lists one current clinical trial [128] sponsored
by the Wroclow Medical University (Poland; CTID:
NCT01231893). The purpose of this Phase I study is to assess
the safety and feasibility of autologous OEC transplantation
into individuals with complete SCI. Patients are currently
being recruited for this study.
4.2 Stem cells from bone marrow, umbilical cord
blood or embryonic tissue
Preclinical studies show that transplantation of bone marrow
cells or umbilical cord blood improves anatomical and func-
tional recovery after SCI (for review see [129]). Results of previ-
ous Phase I/II clinical trials indicate that transplantation,
through lumbar puncture, of bone marrow cells is safe and fea-
sible in people with SCI [130]. Clinicaltrials.gov lists four trials
examining the effects of bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) trans-
plantation after SCI. The first (CTID: NCT00816803), spon-
sored by Cairo University, involved transplantation of
autologous BMSCs into chronically injured spinal cord [131].
Studies were completed in December 2008 and preliminary
reports from a small cohort of patients (n = 18) indicate posi-
tive effects without evidence of tumorigenicity [132]. The
second trial, sponsored by the Translational Research Infor-
matics Center in Japan (CTID: NCT00695149) is testing
safety and efficacy of cell delivery via lumbar puncture with
the goal of restoring sensory and motor function after
SCI [133]. Results from a single case study indicate that the
approach is safe and feasible and that modest improvements
were observed [134]. The estimated completion date for this
trial is Dec. 2010. The third trial, sponsored by TCA Cellular
Therapy, LLC (Louisiana, USA; CTID: NCT01162915)
began in July 2010 [135]. The purpose of this Phase I study is
to determine the safety of intrathecal infusion (via lumbar
puncture) of BMSCs in individuals with SCI below C5. The
fourth, conducted by International Stemcell Services Ltd
(India; CTID: NCT01186679), examined the safety and effi-
cacy of autologous bone marrow derived stem cell transplanta-
tion [136]. Cells were either directly transplanted into the spinal
cord of chronically injured individuals or injected intrathecally
into patients with acute and subacute injuries. The study was
completed in August of 2010 and according to the company

website ‘safety (was) established’ [137]; however, the data have
not been peer reviewed and no results have been posted at
clinicaltrials.gov.
Another trial, sponsored by the China Spinal Cord Injury
Network (CTID: NCT01046786), is examining the feasibil-
ity, safety, efficacy and optimal dose of umbilical cord blood
mononuclear cell transplants, used alone or in combination
with methlypredinsolone or oral lithium in patients with
chronic SCI [138]. Details of the trial design have been pub-
lished but no data are available [139]. A case study reports
morphometric and physical improvements without adverse
effects following umbilical cord stem cell transplantation
into a patient with a chronic (20 years) SCI [140].
Transplanted glial-restricted precursor cells promote
neuroprotection, remyelination and functional recovery in a
preclinical model of SCI (reviewed in [141]). Based on those
data, an FDA-approved Phase I clinical trial, sponsored by
Geron Corp. (CA, USA), was initiated to evaluate the safety
of GRNOPC1, a proprietary human embryonic stem cell-
derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line. GRNOPC1 will
be intraspinally injected into people with acute (7 -- 14 days
post injury), neurologically complete spinal cord injuries
(CTID: NCT01217008) [142]. This is the first FDA-approved
trial to test the therapeutic potential of embryonic tissue for
SCI. Patient enrollment is in progress.
Cellular transplantation therapies are becoming big busi-
ness abroad. Beike Biotechnology in China and the XCell-
Center, a private regenerative medicine clinic in Germany,
offer stem cell-based services as a treatment for SCI. Some
individual case reports from groups not associated with
these companies have reported positive effects with trans-
planted stem cells in individuals with SCI [143-145]. These
companies also cite positive results in patients receiving
their cells; however the data have not been peer-
reviewed [19,146]. Accordingly, many members of the inter-
national scientific community remain skeptical about the
safety and efficacy of these and other transplantation
therapies [19,147-150].
4.3 The role of macrophages in stem cell therapies
Stem cell transplants may modulate post-SCI inflammation.
The precise mechanisms by which this occurs have not
been defined but several reports indicate that macrophage
accumulation is reduced along with intraspinal expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokines [151-153]. It is possible that
stem cells (derived from bone marrow or umbilical cord
blood) promote repair in part by changing macrophage
phenotype and function. The same is potentially true for
OECs. Intraspinal transplantation of OECs into injured
rats alters the macrophage response to SCI [154]. Interest-
ingly, indexes of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation
are increased acutely but decreased chronically with OEC
administration [154]. As discussed above, environmental
cues shape the phenotype and function of macrophages [14,15]
and cues that reduce pro-inflammatory macrophage
activation or that increase the prevalence of alternatively
activated (M2) macrophages could promote neuroprotection
and axon regeneration [13].
In human umbilical cord blood, high concentrations of
IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 exist [155]. These anti-inflammatory
cytokines promote alternative (i.e., M2) macrophage activa-
tion. When purified from blood then injected intrave-
nously, umbilical cord blood cells (UCBCs) also increase
plasma levels of IL-10, IL-13 and IL-4 and reduce the
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-a,
IL-12) from splenocytes [155,156]. Intravenous injection of
UCBCs into mice with a chronic form of experimental
Alzheimer’s disease increases anti-inflammatory cytokines
in the brain [156]. This suggests that injecting stem cells
into animals or people with chronic SCI could alter cyto-
kine expression in the CNS and therefore the phenotype
and function of macrophages, even after damage to the
blood--brain barrier has been repaired.
Bone-marrow derived stem cells have similar effects. In a
model of stroke, human BMSC (hBMSC) increase the ratio
of IL-4:INF-g or IL-4:TNF-a creating a lesion environment
in which an alternative microglial phenotype develops [157].
In vitro data indicate that BMSC release various factors
that promote alternative macrophage activation or that
decrease the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by
macrophages [158-160].
The effect of GRNOPC1 cells on macrophages has not
been evaluated; however, other embryonic stem cells have
been shown to affect inflammation after SCI. Specifically,
macrophage infiltration is reduced following intravenous
administration of undifferentiated cells or intraspinal injec-
tion of glial-restricted precursor cells in rodents [161,162]. Fur-
ther work is needed to determine how macrophages are
affected by GRNOPC1 cells.
5. Conclusions
Spinal cord injury elicits a robust inflammatory response
that is comprised predominantly of activated resident
microglia and newly recruited monocyte-derived macro-
phages. These cells persist indefinitely at the site of injury
and change their phenotype and function in response to sig-
nals in the lesion microenvironment. Such changes occur
spontaneously as a consequence of delayed secondary degen-
eration or repair. Additional changes are expected following
therapeutic intervention. Indeed, all neuroprotective, pro-
regenerative or cell replacement therapies that are currently
being tested in clinical trials for SCI are intended to change
the composition and dynamics of the lesion environment.
Therefore, each intervention has the potential to influence
the activation status, phenotype and function of CNS mac-
rophages (Figure 1). To enhance clinical research outcomes
and improve recovery for individuals with SCI, it will be
important to consider how these interventions affect
CNS macrophages.

6. Expert opinion
Macrophages are found throughout the acute and chronically
injured spinal cord. Their proximity to and ability to interact
with and influence all cells in the nervous system confers upon
them priority status when planning and interpreting different
types of therapeutic intervention. Indeed, macrophages
express a diverse repertoire of receptors that signal regenera-
tive and neurotoxic effector functions. Often times, these
seemingly dichotomous functions are elicited in parallel at
sites of injury/inflammation [12] and the signaling pathways
that control injurious or reparative functions are also used
by neurons and glia. This exemplifies the need to understand
the diversity of receptors and signaling pathways that are
activated in macrophages after SCI so that researchers can
anticipate the effects of a given therapy on macrophage func-
tion. For example, lithium affects GSK activity. Suppression
of neuronal GSK3 is associated with increased regenerative
potential; however, suppression of GSK3 in macrophages
may impair their ability to self-regulate proinflammatory
signaling cascades that culminate in the production of
neurotoxic molecules.
The complexity of macrophage functional diversity is
compounded by the fact that spinal cord injury elicits a
CNS macrophage response comprised of at least two
distinct macrophage subsets, that is resident microglia
and blood monocytes (Figure 2). Furthermore, there is tre-
mendous diversity within each of these macrophage pools.
For example, at least two distinct monocyte subsets are
known to infiltrate the injured spinal cord [13,163] and the
temporal sequence of their entry and activation in the tis-
sue is not fully understood (Figure 2). However, as we
grow to understand that functional heterogeneity defines
the macrophage response after SCI, scientists should rely
less on the potential meaning of more or less staining
with generic macrophage phenotypic markers (i.e., Mac1/
OX-42 (anti-CD11b), ionized calcium-binding adapter
molecule 1 (Iba1), ED-1/CD68) in tissue sections. Indeed,
less labeling for CD11b in response to treatment X may
predict less tissue damage, but if the treatment affects sig-
naling pathways that are mostly active in reparative CNS
macrophages (e.g., M2 cells), the reduction in CD11b
could have adverse effects on resolution of inflammation
and tissue repair.
Future studies should begin to define the different macro-
phage subpopulations that occupy sites of injury and nearby
spinal segments, proximal and distal to the lesion. Within
these regions, we also need to know which ligands and
receptor cascades elicit macrophage activation after SCI. The
ligands may exist in the tissue, blood or cerebrospinal fluid.

Figure 1. Therapies being tested in clinical trials of spinal cord injury (SCI) undoubtedly affect different aspects of CNS
macrophage function. Proliferation/recruitment/migration: Traumatic SCI causes endogenous CNS microglia to proliferate
then migrate to the site of injury. After a few days, monocytes infiltrate the injury site from the blood where they
differentiate into macrophages. A variety of pre-clinical therapies that have proven efficacious may exert their effects in part
by regulating the continuum of microglia/monocyte migration and/or activation. Listed are examples of different
manipulations and their presumed effects on microglia/macrophages (up/down arrow implies activation or suppression)
Activation/heterogeneity/function: Different environmental cues at the site of injury will cause macrophages to adopt unique
phenotypic and functional properties. Macrophages with pro-inflammatory/neurotoxic properties (M1 macrophages) and
those with anti-inflammatory/pro-reparative (M2 macrophages) properties exist early after injury [13]. These functions are
dynamic and can change in response to new stimuli, including various therapeutic interventions that are being tested in
clinical trials. Please see text for description of specific therapeutic approaches.

Currently, the identity and hierarchical regulation of the
endogenous ligands that control the phenotypic and func-
tional diversity of macrophages is unknown. Drugs, cell-based
therapies or rehabilitation therapies may influence many of
these ligands.
At least one ongoing pilot clinical study [164] will determine
how SCI influences circulating levels of an endogenous pro-
tein that can affect microglia/macrophage activation. Specifi-
cally, scientists and clinicians at the North Shore Long
Island Jewish Health System (NY) are measuring circulating
levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) after
SCI [164]. Should this trial identify MIF as a biomarker that
predicts changes in macrophage activation after SCI, it could
serve as an important diagnostic tool for correlating the effects
of therapies with the dynamics of macrophage phenotype
and function.
As we learn more about macrophage heterogeneity and
hierarchical signaling cascades and develop bioassays to assess
macrophage function after injury, designer drugs may be
developed that can affect CNS cells without affecting macro-
phages. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to selectively
manipulate macrophages prior to, in parallel with or after
delivery of a neuroprotective, regenerative or cell-based
therapy. The more we understand about CNS macrophages
and how current therapies affect these cells, the greater the
potential for improving function after spinal cord injury.

Figure 2. Macrophage functional heterogeneity after spinal cord injury (SCI). Microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages
comprise the bulk of CNS macrophages after SCI. The temporal progression of activation and distribution of these different
cell populations is unique with microglia dominant early after SCI. Monocyte-derived macrophages infiltrate after a period of
days then persist indefinitely after SCI. The mechanisms underlying the continuum of activation of each of these cell
populations creates unique challenges for interpreting the effects of therapeutics. Indeed, drugs, cell-based therapies and
rehabilitation can affect the progression of activation, migration and/or differentiation of CNS macrophages.
