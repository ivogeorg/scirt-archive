. BasedIn mammals, the central nervous system (CNS) is sensitive to
mechanical injuries that cause permanent functional deficits.
Mechanical forces imparted to the spinal cord can produce an
immediate disruption of the tissue, with direct axonal and neuro-
nal injury leading to neuronal death. Neuronal death may occur
until hours or days after spinal cord injury (SCI) as a result of ensu-
ing secondary pathological processes. Although a number of strat-
egies have been applied to protect injured spinal cords from
for optimizing regenerative neurogenesis in mammals.
The Sox family of transcription factors is well-established regu-
lators of cell fate decisions and are expressed in a tissue-specific
manner during development [5,6]. In specific, Sox11 is mainly in-
volved in neural development and organogenesis during fetal life
and functions in neural progenitor cells that have already been
committed to neuronal differentiation during neural development
[7,8]. With development, Sox11 expression decreases and is absent
from most normal adult tissues [9]. However, it has been reportedKeywords:

1. Introductionthe therapeutic potential of Sox11 in spinal cord injury. Sox11 markedly improved locomotor recovery
after spinal cord injury and this recovery was accompanied by an up-regulation of Nestin/Doublecortin
expression in the injured spinal cord. Sox11 was mainly located in endogenous neural stem cells lining
the central canal and in newly-generated neurons in the spinal cord. In addition, Sox 11 significantly
induced expressions of BDNF in the spinal cords of LV-Sox11-treated mice. We concluded that Sox11
induced activation of endogenous neural stem cells into neuronal determination and migration within
the injured spinal cord. The resultant increase of BDNF at the injured site might form a distinct neuro-
genic niche which induces a final neuronal differentiation of these neural stem cells. Enhancing Sox11
expression to induce neurogenic differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a
promising strategy in restorative therapy after SCI in mammals.

the degree of motor dysfunction after SCI [17]. All mice were gently
handled and allowed to walk in an open-field to acclimatize them
to the apparatus for several days before induction of SCI. The mice
were tested before injury, to ensure that they demonstrated equiv-or LV-GFP 8.68  105 transducing units in 1 ll) were injected into
the lesion site [16].
The thirty-six mice were divided into two subgroups, an LV-GFP
and LV-Sox11 group. At 1, 2 and 3 weeks after spinal cord hemisec-
tion, three mice for immunohistochemical staining and three mice
for Western blot. The animals were assessed for motor function at
specific time points post-SCI, and subsequently sacrificed for histo-
logical or biochemical measurements.
2.4. Behavioral tests2.3. Spinal cord injury
Spinal cord hemisection was performed as described previously
[14,15]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate.
Dorsal laminectomy was performed to expose segments T9–T11
of the spinal cord using a superficial vein at T5–T6 as a landmark.
The dura was slit (1 mm) at the midline at the T10 level. A com-
plete hemisection of the right hemicord at T10 was performed with
the tip of iridectomy scissors. After surgery, the muscles and skin
were sutured in layers and an antibiotic (Gentamicin, 1000u) was
administered. Paralysis of right hind limb, as observed at 1d after
spinal cord hemisection, indicated that the model was successful.
Each mouse received manual bladder manipulation twice daily un-2.1. Animals
Thirty-six female Kunming mice, weighing 30 ± 5 g, were ob-
tained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Shandong University.
Mice were bred and housed under standard laboratory conditions
at 23 C with an alternating 12 h light and dark cycle and free ac-
cess to a commercial diet. All animal experiments were approved
by the Shandong University Animal Care Committee.
2.2. Lentiviral vectors (LV) vector production
A CD511B (System Biosciences, San Francisco, USA) lentivirus
vector expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) was
constructed to express Sox11 in mice spinal cord. The genome of
the recombinant viral vector consisted of the short version
(530 bp) of the murine cytomegalovirus early promoter (CMV pro-
moter). As a control, an empty CD511B lentivirus vector expressing
enhanced GFP was constructed. Vectors were transfected into

mid Mix (System Biosciences) and purified by ultracentrifugation.

ing cells such as neurons [13]. Therefore, in the present study, we
introduced a lentiviral vector containing the Sox11 gene into in-
jured spinal cords of mice to evaluate their therapeutic potential
for the treatment of SCI.

served for 4 min by 2 independent observers who were blind as
to the treatment group. Scores were assigned for each hindlimband averaged for each day. The data analyses were performed on
these means.
2.5. Tissue processing
Mice were perfused transcardially with ice-cold 4% paraformal-
dehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7.2) at 1, 2 and 3 weeks
after spinal cord hemisection. The spinal cords were removed
and post-fixed in the same fixative. Fifteen-micrometer sections
were prepared on a cryostat. Longitudinal section was made in or-
der to show the structure of injured spinal cord well.
2.6. Immunofluorescence staining and double immunofluorescence
staining
To examine the expression of Sox11 in the injured spinal cord,
immunofluorescence staining was performed. Immunofluores-
cence staining was performed following standard methods. The
sections were subjected to normal goat serum (10% in PBS, pH
7.3) with 0.2% Triton-X 100 applied for 30 min at room temperature
for blocking the sections. The sections were then incubated over-
night at 4 C with rabbit anti-Sox11 (1:100, Millipore, Billerica,
MA) and followed by stainingwith TRITC -conjugated goat anti-rab-
bit IgG (1:100, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at 37 C. Nuclei
were counterstained with DAPI (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
To examine the localization of Sox11 in the spinal cord, double
immunofluorescence staining was performed following standard
methods. Briefly, the sections were subjected to normal goat serum
(10% in PBS, pH 7.3) with 0.2% Triton-X 100 applied for 30 min at
room temperature for blocking the sections. The sections were
then incubated overnight at 4 C with rabbit anti-Sox11 (1:100,
Millipore) and mouse anti-Nestin (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, MA)
or mouse anti-Doublecortin (1:100, Abcam) or mouse anti-MAP2
(1:200, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and followed by staining with
FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, Sigma–Aldrich) and
TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Sigma–Aldrich) for
1 h at 37 C. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:1000,
Invitrogen).
2.7. Western blot analysis
Spinal cord samples used for Western blot analysis were quickly
frozen in liquid nitrogen after surgical resection and maintained at
80 C. Tissues were washed with cold PBS and lysed in cold lysis
buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 240 mM NaCl, 5 mM
EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium vanadate, and 1 g/ml of leupeptin,
pepstatin and aprotinin. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for
30 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C.
The supernatant was then collected and protein content was as-
sayed colorimetrically. Ten micrograms of total proteins were
loaded onto a 10% gradient polyacrylamide gel, electrophoretically
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed
with rabbit anti-Sox11 (1:1000, Millipore, Billerica, MA), or mouse
anti-Nestin (1:1000, Abcam) or mouse anti-Doublecortin (1:1000,
Abcam). Monoclonal anti-b-actin (1:1000, Sigma–Aldrich) was
used as an internal control. Secondary antibodies were horseradish
peroxidase conjugated to rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:5000, Sigma–Aldrich). The membranes were developed using an
ECL detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The intensity of bands
was determined using the Gel pro 4.0 software.
2.8. Statistical analysis
rch Communications 446 (2014) 830–835 831Data in the text and figures were expressed as the mean ± S.D.
of at least three experiments. The data were analyzed using the
Student’s t test. The differences were considered statistically signif-
icant when the P-value was <0.05.
3. Results
3.1. The expression of Sox11 is increased in the injured spinal cord
We established mouse spinal cord hemisection model. Check
whether the right hemicord was thoroughly transected under the
stereo microscope (Fig. 1A). We used thirty-six mice with success-
ful hemi-section for subsequent experiments. Expression of Sox11
in the injured spinal cord was assessed using immunohistochemi-
cal staining at 3 week after spinal cord hemisection. Sox11 expres-
sion was more robust on the injured versus contralateral side and
diminished as a function of distance from the site of injury
(Fig. 1B). On the contralateral side, the expression of Sox11 was
very weak (Fig. 1B).
3.2. Sox11 expression is located in ependymal cells lining the central
canal and in newly-generated neurons in the injured spinal cord
To identify Sox11-positive cells in the injured spinal cord, tis-
sues were double stained with Sox11 and Nestin/Doublecortin/
MAP2 at 3 week after spinal cord hemisection. In the ependymal
cells lining the central canal, immunofluorescence signals for
Sox11 co-localized with the immunofluorescence signal for Nestin
(Fig. 1C), suggesting that Sox11 was expressed in endogenous
NSCs. Whereas, in the gray matter, immunofluorescence signals
for Sox11 co-localized with the immunofluorescence signals for
3.3. LV-mediated expression of exogenous genes in the injured spinal
cord
We first examined whether lentiviral vector stably transduced
spinal cord tissue by injecting the lentiviral vector encoding Sox11
into the lesion site immediately after spinal cord hemi-section.
GFP was detectable within 1 week after spinal cord hemi-section
and this expression increased further thereafter. At 3 weeks, a strong
GFP signal, extending into the cervical and lumbar spinal cord over
distances of at least 4 mm from the center of the lesion site was
found (Fig. 2A and B). Of all GFP-positive cells, 45% were Nestin-
positive NSCs and located along the central canal (Fig. 2C), while
25.3% were Doublecortin-positive cells and located in the gray
matter (Fig. 2D). Thus, for at least a 3-week period, LV-Sox11 was
capable of transducing NSCs and immature neurons within the
injured spinal cord.
Quantitative Western Blot analysis confirmed the immunohis-
tochemical results regarding Sox11 expression. At 1 week after in-
jury, Sox11 expression was increased in both LV-Sox11 and LV-GFP
injected spinal cords as compared with that of intact spinal cords
(data not shown). Sox11 expression was significantly increased
in LV-Sox11-treated mice compared with LV-GFP-treated mice at
2–3 weeks after injury (Fig. 2E) indicating transgene Sox11 over-
expression.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a pleiotropic
growth factor that affects neuronal survival, differentiation and
regeneration. To assess the possible influence of Sox11 on expres-
sion of BDNF, double immunofluorescence staining and Western

4. Discussion
In the present study, we reported that the expression of Sox11
was increased after SCI and mainly located in ependymal cells lin-
ing the central canal and in newly-generated neurons in the spinal
cord. There exists evidence from several sources indicating that the
ependymal zone of the central canal may serve as a stem cell niche
[18]. It had been reported that Sox11 expression is strictly confined
to Doublecortin-expressing neuronally committed precursors/
immature neurons in the adult brain and regulates adult neurogen-
esis [8,10,19,20]. These facts suggests that Sox11 played an impor-
tant role in inducing endogenous stem cell neuronal determination
after injury and initiating intrinsic repair mechanisms. Another
noteworthy feature of Sox11 expression profile was that Sox11
was expressed in the cytoplasm of newly-generated neurons,
whereas it was expressed in the nuclei of ependymal cells. Similar
phenomenon was found in the study of the subcellular Sox11 dis-
tribution in mantal cell lymphoma [21]. For some Sox proteinsFig. 4. Recovery of motor function after spinal cord hemi-section in mice. The
degree of motor impairment was assessed in a blinded manner using the BMS
protocol. Scores range from 0 (complete paralysis) to 9 (normal movement of the
hindlimbs). Scores were assigned, for each of the right hindlimbs and the scores
resulting from the two observers were then averaged for each mouse. Mice treated
with LV-Sox11 demonstrated marked improvements from weeks 1 to 3. A
statistically significant difference was found in a comparison with LV-GFP group
at 2–3 weeks (⁄P < 0.05). Data are means ± S.D. of 6 mice/group.mechanism, of relevance for all Sox proteins including sox11, is
unknown. Further studies are needed to establish the importance
of Sox11 nuclear export.
A lentiviral vector expressing GFP containing the Sox11 gene
was introduced into the injured spinal cords to evaluate the ther-
apeutic potential of Sox11 in mice with SCI. Sox11 markedly
improved locomotor recovery and this recovery was accompanied
by a up-regulation of Nestin/Doublecortin expression in the
injured spinal cord. Moreover, some GFP-positive cells along the
central canal expressed Nestin, a neural stem cell marker and some
GFP-positive cells in the gray matter of injured spinal cords ex-
pressed Doublecortin, an immature neuronal cell marker. Data
from previous studies using embryonic spinal cords revealed that
Nestin expression occurs in cells expressing group B1 Sox located
in the ventricular zone and in those expressing Sox11 (and possibly
other group C Sox) located in the subventricular zone [24,25]. Re-
cently, it has been shown that human glioma-initiating cells lose
Sox11 expression and over-expression of Sox11 prevents tumori-
genesis of glioma-initiating cells by inducing neuronal differentia-
tion [12]. In the present study, we also found that Sox11 promoted
Doublecortin expression and was co-localized with Doublecortin,
suggesting that Sox11might promote neurogenesis after SCI. Based
on the information presented above, we hypothesized that Sox11-
dependent Nestin positive cells might represent activated NSCs,
and that Sox11 induced these activated NSCs in the subventricular
unofluorescence staining of BDNF and Sox11 within the injured spinal cord. Yellow

of self-repair after injury.
One possibility mechanism of Sox11 effect on endogenous NSCs
is that Sox11 may function as a regulator of Nestin expression. It is
believed that Sox proteins cooperate with partner factors by bind-
ing to a nearby site of target DNA sequences and thus selectively
regulate a cell-specific group of genes [7]. The identity of a partner
factor that cooperates with Sox11 to activate Nestin expression is
not known. It has been shown that a potential Sox protein binding
site is present in the 258 bp mouse Nestin enhancer, immediately
upstream of the POU binding site [25]. These findings raised the
possibility that Sox11 could promote the expression of Nestin by
interacting with POU domain transcription factors. However, more
studies are needed to establish the specific partner factor of Sox11
that regulating neuronal fate.
In the present study, we also found that Sox11 promoted BDNF
expression and Sox11 was co-localized with BDNF in the gray mat-
ter. It has been shown that Sox11 plays an important role in regu-
lating injury-induced BDNF expression in an exon promoter-
specific manner [26]. BDNF is known to support differentiation of
NSCs to neurons as revealed under both in vitro and in vivo condi-
tions [27,28]. High concentrations of BDNF in the injured spinal
cord have the potential to form a distinct neurogenic niche, which
could then induce neuronal differentiation of endogenous NSCs.
Thus, an elevation in Sox11 expression in response to SCI could
lead to long-term activation of BDNF transcription and contribute
to neuronal determination of endogenous NSCs.
In the adult spinal cord, endogenous NSCs exist in a quiescent
state. Their capacity for constitutive proliferation and neurogenesis
is limited, correlating with their ability to regenerate after injury.
Enhancing Sox11 expression to induce neurogenic differentiation
of endogenous NSCs after injury may be a promising strategy in
restorative therapy after SCI in mammals.
