Neurons in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) cannot regenerate axons after injury. in contrast, 
neurons in the mammalian peripheral nervous system and in some non-mammalian models, such as C. elegans 
and Drosophila, are able to regrow axons. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these neurons 
support axon regeneration will help us find ways to enhance mammalian CNS axon regeneration. Here, recent 
studies in which signaling pathways regulating naturally-occurring axon regeneration that have been identified 
are reviewed, focusing on how these pathways control gene expression and growth-cone function during axon 
regeneration.
Keywords: axon regeneration; axonal growth; signal transduction
Introduction
Damage to the central nervous system (CNS), such as 
spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury, often results 
in damage to axons. Unfortunately, mature neurons in 
the mammalian CNS cannot regenerate axons after 
injury, leading to irreversible motor, sensory, or cognitive 
dysfunctions. Therefore, promoting axon regeneration 
is a major approach to treating these symptoms. one 
important reason for CNS regeneration failure is the 
irreversible loss of the intrinsic axon growth capacity of 
CNS neurons after maturation. To address this issue, 
recent attempts to augment the growth potential by 
regulating transcriptional or translational machinery have 
provided promising results[1-5]. However, the degree of axon 
regeneration promoted by these molecular interventions 
is still rudimentary compared with the regeneration that 
occurs after injury to the mammalian peripheral nervous 
system (PNS) or in non-mammals. This fact indicates 
that understanding the molecular mechanisms by which 
naturally-occurring axon regeneration is regulated should 
be a major focus of investigation. The first step would be to 
elucidate the underlying signaling pathways that regulate 
naturally-occurring axon regeneration. 
Many mature CNS neurons in non-mammals, such 
as C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish, are able to 
regenerate after injuries. The powerful genetic approaches 
available in these species have made them attractive model 
systems for dissecting the signaling pathways controlling 
axon regeneration. indeed, recent studies using these 
systems, in particular C. elegans, have revealed several 
regeneration signaling pathways in vivo[6-8]. The mammalian 
PNS also mounts a robust regenerative response after 
nerve injury. However, in mice it is difficult to perform similar 
genetic analysis, which often involves genetic targeting of 
multiple signaling molecules at the same time, specifically 
in adult neurons. As a result, we know much less about 
the signaling pathways that regulate naturally-occurring 
mammalian axon regeneration in vivo. 
Axon extension, during either development or 
regeneration, comprises several highly-coordinated 
processes, including gene transcription/expression in 
the soma, transport of synthesized molecules along the 
axon, and axon assembly at the growth cone (Fig. 1). 
Each process is regulated by spatially-controlled signaling 
pathways that target distinct effectors. For instance, 
pathways regulating axon assembly at the growth cone 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 411–420412
mainly target cytoskeletal proteins, especially microtubules, 
to control axon extension, whereas pathways regulating 
gene expression in the soma mainly target transcription 
factors. Recently, several signaling pathways that regulate 
naturally-occurring axon regeneration have been identified 
in non-mammalian and mammalian PNS models. Here, 
we review these pathways, focusing on where they act 
(soma or growth cone) to regulate axon regeneration. 
Pathways that are ectopically manipulated to enhance axon 
regeneration are not discussed.
Signaling Pathways That Regulate Axon Regene-
ration in Non-mammalian Models
Non-mammalian organisms, including C. elegans , 
Drosophila, and zebrafish, are invaluable model systems 
for studying neuronal morphogenesis during development. 
The powerful genetic tools available in C. elegans 
and Drosophila have made them particularly useful for 
delineating upstream/downstream signaling pathways via 
epistatic analysis. Recent efforts have been made to induce 
axotomy and assess axon regeneration in adult neurons of 
C. elegans and Drosophila[6], thus making them attractive 
new model systems for dissecting axon regeneration 
pathways. To induce axotomy in C. elegans, Hammarlund 
et al. used a loss-of-function mutant of the unc-70 gene 
(homolog of β-spectrin). In such mutants, the adult axons 
become fragile and break when the animals move, which 
initiates a regenerative response[9]. Another approach 
for injury in live C. elegans is to use a femtosecond 
laser to perform acute axotomy of fluorescence-labeled 
neurons[10,11]. Similar laser axotomy has also been 
established in Drosophila[12] and zebrafish[13]. Using such 
in vivo axotomy approaches combined with large-scale 
genetic screening, recent studies have identified several 
signaling pathways that control axon regeneration in vivo 
either at the growth cone or at the soma (Fig. 2).
Signaling at the Growth Cone
Growth cones are highly specialized structures at the distal 
tips of axons that control the rate and direction of axon 
growth during development. Assembly of the cytoskeletal 
elements and membrane components at the growth 
cone drives its advancement and the subsequent axon 
extension. Formation of a growth cone after axotomy, 
which is achieved via reorganization of the cytoskeleton 
at the proximal axonal stump, is the f irst step for 
successful regeneration. Both growth-cone formation and 
advancement are tightly regulated by extracellular factors 
and intracellular signaling molecules[14,15].
Currently, there is no experimental approach in C. 
elegans to spatially distinguish signaling events during 
axon growth. However, based on downstream effectors 
and the time-courses in observed phenotypes, it seems 
that the regeneration pathways identified in C. elegans 
to date act mostly in the axon to control growth-cone 
formation after axotomy (Fig. 2). A large-scale RNAi-based 
genetic screen has identified dual leucine zipper-bearing 
kinase 1 (DLK-1) as a key regulator of axon regeneration[9]. 
Genetic interaction experiments have identified MKK-4 
(MAP kinase kinase 4, MAP2K4) and PMK-3 (p38 MAP 
Fig. 1. Axon growth is achieved by coordinated regulation of gene expression in the soma, axonal transport along the shaft, and axon 
assembly at the growth cone.
Saijilafu, et al.    Signaling pathways that regulate axon regeneration 413
kinase) as downstream mediators of DLK-1 to control axon 
regeneration. How does the DLK-1/MKK-4/PMK-3 MAP 
kinase pathway regulate axon regeneration? Because 
the major phenotype of the DLK-1 mutant is a defect in 
growth-cone formation after axotomy[9] and the temporal 
requirement of DLK-1 function for regeneration is very 
soon after the axotomy, it has been suggested that DLK-1 
mainly functions locally at the growth cone to control axon 
regeneration. in support, a different study has shown that 
MAK-2 (MAP kinase activated kinase, MAPKAP) acts 
downstream of DLK-1 to control axon regeneration via 
controlling the local translation of CEBP-1 in the axon[16]. 
To further support the role of DLK-1 in the growth cone, a 
later study showed that KLP-7 (kinesin-13) and CCPP-6 
(cytosolic carboxipeptidase), two proteins directly involved 
in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, act downstream 
of DLK-1 to control axon regeneration[17]. Specifically, DLK-1 
inhibits KLP-7, which has microtubule depolymerase activity 
and functions to restrict microtubule assembly. Conversely, 
DLK-1 activates CCPP-6, which deglutamylates tubulin 
Fig. 2. Signaling pathways regulating axon regeneration in non-mammalian models. In the soma, axotomy activates the transcription 
factors KLF6/7 to control the expression of genes supporting axon regeneration, whereas Notch signaling acts as a negative 
regulator. At the growth cone, axotomy triggers Ca2+ influx, which subsequently activates the apoptotic Ced3/4 pathway and/or the 
second messenger AC/cAMP/PKA pathway, both of which converge onto the DLK-1 pathway. Downstream, DLK-1 regulates local 
protein translation through the MKK4/PMK-3/MAK2 pathway and/or promotes axonal microtubule assembly by controlling multiple 
microtubule binding proteins, including CCPP, KLP-7, and EFA-6. Specifically, DLK-1 activates CCPP, which deglutamylates tubulin 
and functions to promote microtubule stabilization. Conversely, both KLP-7, which depolymerizes microtubules, and EFA-6, which 
destabilizes them, are inhibited by DLK-1. Another MAP kinase pathway, MLK-1/MEK-1/KGB-1, acts in parallel with the DLK-1 
pathway to control growth-cone formation after axotomy. SVH-1, a homolog of the mammalian hepatocyte growth factor and its 
receptor SVH-2 function upstream of the MLK-1 pathway to promote axon regeneration, whereas SVH-3, a homolog of mammalian 
fatty-acid amide hydrolase, inhibits axon regeneration by antagonizing the MLK-1 pathway. Lastly, the expression of the tubulin 
isoform Tuba1a regulated by KLF6/7 may contribute to the control of growth-cone remodeling during axon regeneration. 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 411–420414
and promotes microtubule stabilization. Moreover, another 
genetic screen study has identified EFA-6, an Arf guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor, as a negative regulator of 
axon regeneration via destabilizing axonal microtubules[18]. 
Because the loss-of-function mutant of EFA-6 partially 
bypasses the requirement of DLK-1 for axon regeneration, 
it is likely that EFA-6 is also a downstream mediator of 
DLK-1. What are the upstream regulators of the DLK-1 
pathway? First, an axotomy-induced Ca2+ increase through 
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or internal Ca2+ stores is 
necessary for axon regeneration in C. elegans[19]. The 
promoting effect of Ca2+ signaling on axon regeneration 
is mediated by activation of adenyl cyclase (AC) and the 
subsequent elevation of cAMP, which in turn activates 
PKA[19]. importantly, the Ca2+/AC/cAMP/PKA pathway acts 
upstream of DLK-1 to promote axon regeneration. Second, 
a very recent study[20] has shown that the core apoptotic 
executioner protein CED-3 (caspase) and its activator 
CED-4 (Apaf-1) play surprising roles in controlling axon 
regeneration by acting upstream of DLK-1. interestingly, 
in the same study, the CED-4/CED-3 pathway was also 
placed downstream of axotomy-induced local Ca2+ influx.
In the same RNAi screen using a β-spectrin mutant that 
identified DLK-1[9], another MAPKKK, MLK-1, was shown 
to control axon regeneration in parallel with the DLK-1 
pathway[21] (Fig. 2). Downstream mediators of MLK-1 are 
MEK-1 and KGB-1 (JNK). JNK signaling is also upregulated 
in Drosophila upon axonal injury in a brain needle-injury 
model[22] and a crushed larval ventral nerve cord model[23]. 
in a Drosophila whole-brain culture model, expression of 
dominant-negative JNK blocks axon regeneration, whereas 
expression of the constitutively active form of Drosophila 
JNK kinase induces robust regrowth of the severed axons, 
one-third of which even extend to re-enter the target area[24]. 
Because JNK is well known to regulate axonal microtubules 
in mammalian neurons during axon growth[25-28], it is likely 
that the MLK-1/MEK-1/KGB-1 pathway in C. elegans also 
targets microtubules for controlling axon regeneration. 
Additional studies in C. elegans have shown that SVH-1, 
a homolog of mammalian hepatocyte growth factor and its 
receptor SVH-2 function upstream of the MLK-1 pathway to 
promote axon regeneration[29], whereas SVH-3, a homolog 
of mammalian fatty acid amide hydrolase, inhibits axon 
regeneration through antagonizing the MLK-1 pathway[30].
in summary, two MAP kinase pathways function in C. 
elegans to regulate naturally-occurring axon regeneration, 
and both pathways mainly act locally at the axon to control 
microtubule reorganization and growth-cone remodeling 
upon axotomy (Fig. 2).
Signaling at the Neuronal Soma
The large-scale genetic screen in C. elegans[18] has also 
identified several transcription factors that may regulate 
axon regeneration by modulating gene expression in the 
soma. However, no detailed study of these molecules 
has been reported yet. one unexpected player that may 
function to control gene expression during C. elegans axon 
regeneration is the protein Notch[31]. Specifically, Notch acts 
as a negative regulator of axon regeneration independent 
of extracellular Notch ligands. Downstream of Notch, ADAM 
metalloprotease and γ-secretase in the canonical pathway 
cleave the Notch to generate the Notch intracellular domain 
(NCiD), which translocates into the nucleus to control 
gene expression. importantly, direct ectopic expression 
of GFP-NCiD is sufficient to allow entry into the nucleus 
and inhibit axon regeneration, confirming the role of Notch 
signaling in the regulation of gene expression. Axons in the 
zebrafish optic nerve are able to regenerate after injury. 
By comparing gene expression in injured and uninjured 
neurons, Krüeppel-like factors (KLFs) 6/7 have been shown 
to regulate the axon regeneration of zebrafish retinal 
ganglion cells[32]. A subsequent study showed that KLF6/7 
regulate axon regeneration by controlling the transcription 
of the tubulin isoform Tuba1a[33]. How Notch signaling and 
KLF6/7 are regulated by upstream signaling pathways is 
not known.
in sum, very few signaling pathways have been shown 
to control gene expression during axon regeneration. 
Future studies using these non-mammalian models should 
focus on somatic signaling to expand our knowledge of 
how gene expression is regulated during successful axon 
regeneration.
Signaling Pathways That Regulate Mammalian 
Axon Regeneration
Adult Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) as a Model 
System for Mammalian Axon Regeneration
Among adult PNS neurons, DRG neurons provide 
Saijilafu, et al.    Signaling pathways that regulate axon regeneration 415
a favorable model  for  studying mammal ian axon 
regeneration. Each DRG neuron extends a unipolar axon 
that splits into two branches: one innervates peripheral 
targets (peripheral branch) and the other enters the spinal 
cord (central branch). The peripheral branch regenerates 
robustly after peripheral nerve injury, whereas the central 
branch in the spinal cord fails to regenerate after spinal cord 
injury. However, if axotomy of the peripheral branch occurs 
prior to central branch axotomy (a pre-conditioning lesion), 
regeneration of the central axons is greatly enhanced[34]. 
Recent studies found that this effect could be achieved if 
the peripheral axotomy was performed at the same time[35] 
or even after the central axotomy[36]. These results indicate 
that peripheral axotomy increases the intrinsic ability of 
DRG neurons to support axon regeneration by activation 
of a transcription-dependent regeneration program and 
the subsequent expression of a group of regeneration-
associated genes in the soma[37]. Because the central 
branches of the DRG neurons share the same environment 
as corticospinal axons, it is believed that activation of a 
similar regeneration program in adult CNS neurons would 
enhance CNS axon regeneration. Unfortunately, the 
signaling pathways underlying this peripheral axotomy-
induced transcriptional program remain elusive. As noted, 
it is very difficult to dissect signaling pathways in vivo in 
the adult mouse model because the genetic modulation 
of multiple genes specifically in adult tissues is required. 
Therefore, to date no signaling pathways (consisting of 
multiple upstream/downstream signaling molecules) that 
regulate naturally-occurring mammalian axon regeneration 
have been delineated in vivo. A novel in vivo electroporation 
technique has recently been developed that allows specific 
manipulation of multiple gene expression in adult DRG 
neurons simultaneously[38], providing a potentially useful 
tool for the in vivo dissection of pathways regulating 
mammalian axon regeneration. 
in contrast to the in vivo model, adult DRG neurons 
can readily be cultured and therefore have been widely 
used to study axon growth from mature neurons in 
vitro[39]. Depending on the experimental procedure or the 
culture conditions, in vitro axon growth from adult DRG 
neurons can be stimulated and regulated by distinct 
mechanisms and signaling pathways[40, 41]. Therefore, to 
study regeneration pathways, it is important to use an in 
vitro model that mimics in vivo peripheral axotomy-induced 
axon regeneration. if an in vivo peripheral nerve injury 
is performed prior to culture, the cultured DRG neurons 
are able to extend long axons overnight. Such peripheral 
axotomy-induced regenerative axon growth often starts 
within a few hours after cell plating and the axons extend 
with few branches (elongation mode)[41]. in contrast, naïve 
(uninjured) DRG neurons cultured at low density grow few 
axons in the first 24 h in the absence of growth factors. 
Addition of growth factors (e.g. NGF or GDNF) induces 
robust axon growth. However, such NGF-induced growth 
is regulated by a different pathway from that of peripheral 
axotomy-induced axon growth (see below) and the 
processes show a highly-branched morphology (sprouting 
mode)[39, 41].  Together, this evidence suggests that 
peripheral axotomy-induced regenerative axon growth and 
a culture condition without axon-promoting growth factors 
should be the model of choice for studying regeneration 
signaling pathways in vitro. Signaling pathways regulating 
mammalian axon regeneration in the PNS are summarized 
in Fig. 3.
Signaling at the Growth Cone
one way to spatially dissect signaling pathways in neurons 
is the two-compartmental culture system that separates 
somata from axons both physically and chemically, such 
as the traditional Campenot chamber[42, 43] and the recently-
developed microfluidic-based chambers[44, 45]. Using such 
approaches, previous studies have shown that Pi3K and 
ERK, two major signaling molecules mediating NGF-
induced axon growth[46], are both required locally at the 
axon to control axon growth from developing sensory 
neurons[47]. To our knowledge, no similar study has been 
reported for regenerative axon growth from adult neurons. 
However, an interesting observation of peripheral axotomy-
induced regenerative axon growth from adult DRG 
neurons is that active gene transcription is not required 
for axon growth in the first 24 h[41, 48]. Such a property 
therefore provides a unique opportunity for investigating 
transcription-independent signaling mechanisms that 
specifically regulate local axon assembly. In contrast to that 
of developing DRG neurons, regenerative axon growth from 
adult DRG neurons does not require Pi3K and ERK activity 
for local axon assembly[40, 41], indicating growth factor-
independent pathways for PNS axon regeneration. indeed, 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 411–420416
application of a function-blocking antibody to NGF is unable 
to inhibit peripheral nerve regeneration[49], providing solid 
evidence that in vivo peripheral axon regeneration does 
not require NGF. Consistent with this, adult DRG neurons 
undergoing peripheral axotomy are able to extend long 
axons in culture in the absence of growth factors[41]. 
instead, activation of integrin signaling by laminin 
is sufficient to induce robust axon growth from these 
pre-axotomized DRG neurons, suggesting that integrin 
signaling plays a key role in peripheral nerve regeneration. 
indeed, laminin isoforms are highly enriched in peripheral 
nerve pathways[50], and loss of integrin subtype alpha 7 
impedes facial nerve regeneration in vivo after a lesion[51]. 
Downstream of integrin signaling, regenerative axon growth 
is mediated by the inactivation of glycogen synthase 3 
(GSK3)[41], which in turn controls growth-cone microtubule 
assembly via the microtubule-binding protein adenomatous 
polyposis coli (APC) and CLiP-associating proteins 
(CLASPs)[52]. Both APC and CLASPs are microtubule plus-
end tracking proteins that stabilize dynamic microtubules 
without interfering with microtubule polymerization[53]. 
Down-regulation of CLASPs in adult DRG neurons reduces 
tubulin acetylation/microtubule stability and inhibits sensory 
axon regeneration in vivo[52], providing strong evidence that 
regulation of axonal microtubule dynamics is important for 
successful axon regeneration.
in addition to microtubule-binding proteins, microtubule 
dynamics are also regulated by post-translational modification, 
in particular acetylation, which is associated with increased 
microtubule stabilization[54]. A recent study showed that 
Fig. 3. Signaling pathways regulating naturally-occurring mammalian axon regeneration in the peripheral nervous system. In the soma, 
peripheral axotomy upregulates and activates many regeneration-associated transcription factors, such as p53, Stat3, Sox11, 
ATF3, Smad1, and c-Jun, which control gene expression that supports axon regeneration. The PI3K–GSK3 and DLK–JNK pathways 
are potential upstream regulators of these transcription factors. At the growth cone, the integrin–GSK3–CLASP/APC pathway 
stabilizes axonal microtubules, whereas the Ca2+–PKC–HDAC5 pathway maintains microtubule dynamics. The coordination of the 
two pathways controls the balance of microtubule dynamics and stabilization to achieve optimal microtubule assembly and axon 
growth. The DLK–Stat3/JNK pathways may also be involved in the regulation of microtubule assembly during axon regeneration.
Saijilafu, et al.    Signaling pathways that regulate axon regeneration 417
peripheral axotomy induces tubulin deacetylation and 
therefore increases microtubule dynamics in axons at the 
proximal injury site[55]. inhibition of tubulin deacetylation with 
a pharmacological inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
blocks sensory axon regeneration in vivo, suggesting that 
maintaining microtubule dynamics is necessary for axon 
regeneration. importantly, using the Campenot chamber 
culture system, it was shown that inhibition of HDAC 
locally at the axon is sufficient to block axon growth, 
confirming that HDAC acts locally on axonal microtubules 
to control axon growth rather than at the soma to control 
gene transcription. HDAC5 has been identified as the 
deacetylase that mediates peripheral axotomy-induced 
tubulin deacetylation. Further studies showed that axotomy-
induced Ca2+ influx and the subsequent activation of PKC 
act upstream of HDAC5 to regulate tubulin acetylation and 
axon growth. 
Together, these studies highlight the important role 
of axonal microtubule dynamics in the regulation of 
mammalian axon regeneration. Notably, either down-
regulation of CLASPs which reduces tubulin acetylation[52], 
or inhibition of HDAC which increases tubulin acetylation[55], 
blocks sensory axon regeneration, suggesting that a 
balance of microtubule stabilization and dynamics is 
required for optimal axon regeneration. 
Signaling at the Neuronal Soma
Gene expression at the soma, which provides the raw 
materials for axon assembly, is necessary for sustained 
axon growth. The regeneration-associated genes identified 
by genetic profiling include many transcription factors, 
such as c-Jun, Stat3, ATF3, Smad1, p53, and SoX11 
(Fig. 3). it is well recognized that these factors control the 
transcription of genes that support peripheral axotomy-
induced axon regeneration[56, 57]. How upstream signaling 
pathways regulate the expression and/or activation of these 
factors is less clear. 
Genetic delet ion of Pten and the subsequent 
activation of the Pi3K–Akt pathway have recently been 
shown to drastically promote the intrinsic axon growth 
of mature mammalian CNS neurons by controlling the 
mTor pathway[1,2,4]. Does the Pi3K pathway play any role 
in the regulation of intrinsic axon growth during naturally-
occurring PNS axon regeneration? in a mutant mouse 
line, where p110δ, the endogenous catalytic subunit of 
Pi3K, is replaced with an inactive mutation, sensory axon 
regeneration is greatly impaired[58]. Because the Pi3K 
pathway is not required for local axon assembly during 
sensory axon regeneration[40,41], this result suggests that 
Pi3K regulates mammalian sensory axon regeneration by 
controlling gene expression in the soma. indeed, in such 
p110δ mutant mice, the expression level of Sprr1A, a 
well-known regeneration-associated gene, is significantly 
diminished. How Pi3K signaling regulates the expression 
of Sprr1A is not known, but it is most likely through 
controlling transcription factors. For instance, many of the 
regeneration-associated transcription factors are regulated 
by GSK3, which is a major downstream signaling mediator 
of Pi3K[57]. Future study using a compartmentalized 
culture system is required to provide a more definitive 
answer regarding the role of Pi3K in the regulation of gene 
expression during mammalian axon regeneration.
As discussed earlier, in C. elegans, DLK-1 regulates 
axon regeneration mainly by acting at the growth cone (Fig. 
2). in contrast, recent studies of DLK knockout mice have 
shown that mammalian DLK controls axon regeneration 
via the activation of c-Jun and Stat3[59, 60], suggesting a role 
of DLK in controlling gene expression in the soma (Fig. 3). 
Further experiments showed that DLK does not directly 
activate Stat3 but regulates the retrograde transport of 
activated Stat3 from the injury site[59]. Although not tested 
directly, it is likely that DLK regulates c-Jun activation 
through JNK. To date, however, there is no direct evidence 
showing that DLK regulates peripheral axotomy-induced 
gene expression, and future genetic-profiling studies of 
DLK knockout mice may provide an answer. it should 
be noted that besides regulating transcription factors, 
DLK–JNK has also been shown to regulate developmental 
axon growth by controlling microtubule stability at the 
growth cone[61]. Whether DLK–JNK signaling also regulates 
axonal microtubules during mammalian axon regeneration 
awaits further study. Moreover, a new study[62] found 
that Stat3 controls microtubule stability locally in the 
axon independent of its transcriptional activity, raising 
the possibility that DLK–Stat3 activated at the injury site 
after peripheral axotomy may also play a local role in the 
regulation of axon regeneration. Together, the evidence to 
date suggests that DLK signaling regulates mammalian 
axon regeneration by controlling gene expression in the 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 411–420418
neuronal soma and/or microtubule dynamics in the growth 
cone.
Summary and Future Directions
Successful axonal regeneration in the injured nervous 
system is a complex process that involves coordinated 
regulation of gene expression in the soma and cytoskeleton 
assembly at the growth cone. The emergence of non-
mammalian injury and regeneration models has provided 
new opportunities to identify signaling pathways that 
regulate naturally-occurring axon regeneration. Because 
the genetic approaches used in the non-mammalian 
models are not available for mammalian models, it is not 
practical to perform similar large-scale genetic screening in 
mice to identify mammalian axon regeneration pathways. 
Therefore, verifying if signaling pathways identified in 
the non-mammalian models also function in mammalian 
models will be the focus of future studies. The recently-
developed technique of in vivo electroporation of adult 
sensory neurons[38] would make such studies more feasible 
and efficient.
Most of the axon regeneration pathways identified 
to date are located at the growth cone (see Figs. 2 and 
3), and much less is known about signaling pathways 
functioning at the soma to control gene expression. 
Because the manipulation of gene expression (transcription 
or translation) has proven effective in promoting CNS axon 
regeneration[1-5], elucidating the signaling pathways that 
regulate gene expression during naturally-occurring axon 
regeneration in the mammalian PNS should become a 
major focus of axon regeneration research.
