Abstract
An incomplete lesion of the ascending afferents from the hand in the dorsal columns of the spinal
cord in monkeys is followed after weeks of recovery by a reactivation of much of the territory of
the hand representations in primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). However, the relationship
between the extent of the dorsal column lesion and the amount of cortical reactivation has not been
clear. Largely, this is due to the uncertainties about axon sparing after spinal cord lesions. Here,
we unilaterally sectioned dorsal column afferents in the cervical spinal cord (C4-C6) in adult
squirrel monkeys. After weeks of recovery, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the
distal phalanges to label normal and surviving afferents to the cuneate nuclei representing the
hands. Days later, the responsiveness of neurons in cortical areas 3b and 1 to tactile stimulation on
the hand was evaluated in a microelectrode mapping session. The sizes and densities of CTB-
labeled patches in the cuneate nuclei of both sides were quantified and compared. The results
indicate that extensive reactivations of the hand representations in cortical areas 3b and 1 occur
contralateral to the spinal cord lesion, even when less than 1% of labeled dorsal column
terminations in the cuneate nucleus remained. These results raise the possibilities that secondary
afferents from innervated neurons in the spinal cord contribute to the reactivation, and that the
reactivation of area 1 is not completely dependent on inputs from area 3b.
INTRODUCTION
After partial or nearly complete damage to the nervous system, mature humans and other
mammals typically demonstrate some behavioral recovery over a period of days to months
(Almli and Finger, 1988; Nudo et al., 2000; Muellbacher and Hallett, 2006; Kaas et al.,
2008). The reasons for these recoveries are not completely clear, but there is evidence that
the potentiation of existing neuronal connections, as well as the growth of new synaptic
connections, play important roles in the process (e.g., Garraghty et al., 1991; Florence and
Kaas, 1995; Jain et al., 2000; Darian-Smith and Ciferri, 2005; Qi et al., 2010). One approach
to studying recovery after damage to the nervous system in monkeys is to evaluate the
responsiveness of somatosensory cortex to tactile stimuli after weeks of recovery from a
sensory loss. A useful way of providing an incomplete sensory loss is sectioning the

ascending branches of peripheral afferents as they ascend in the dorsal columns of the
cervical spinal cord. Other branches of the afferents terminate in the dorsal horn of the
spinal cord, and these neurons provide sensory information to spinal cord circuits, as well as
contribute to other ascending sensory pathways (Willis and Coggeshall, 2004). Thus,
locomotion and other motor behaviors largely appear to be normal after such lesions, while
grasping and food retrieval behavior are impaired initially, but often recover over a few
post-lesion weeks (Leonard et al., 1992; Cooper et al., 1993; Jain et al., 1997). After
unilateral dorsal column lesions at a high cervical spinal cord level, the contralateral primary
somatosensory cortex (area 3b) can become completely unresponsive to tactile stimuli on
the hand and other parts of the lower body, or islands of cortex can remain responsive to
preserved dorsal columns afferents after incomplete lesions (Jain et al., 1997, 2000, 2008).
After months of recovery, most or all of the cortex in area 3b can recover responsiveness to
preserved sensory inputs. This suggests that preserved inputs from the hand becomes
potentiated by reduced inhibition (Jones, 1993; Garraghty et al., 1991, 2006) and the
formation of new connections (e.g., Florence and Kaas, 1995; Jain et al., 2000; Churchill et
al., 2004). Another possibility is that neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord with
inputs from the hand project to the cuneate nucleus and contribute to the recovery (Rustioni
et al., 1979; Bennett et al., 1983; Willis and Coggeshall, 2004). Although these second order
afferents are thought to join the dorsal columns before they reach the cuneate nucleus, some
of them possibly avoid the lesion zone and reach the cuneate nucleus. Finally, spinothalamic
neurons may contribute to cortical reactivations.
Here, we relate the extents of afferent loss to the extents and types of cortical reactivations
by afferents from the hand after seven to nine weeks of recovery from large to nearly
complete dorsal column lesions in squirrel monkeys. The results indicate that extensive
amounts of deprived cortex can be reactivated, even when very few dorsal columns afferents
from the hand remain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The somatotopic organization of the hand representations in somatosensory areas 3b and 1
were studied in four adult male squirrel monkeys (Saimiri bolivians). Three monkeys
received a unilateral section of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord at a C4-C6 cervical
level. The fourth monkey received a unilateral small lesion in the white matter near the
lateroventral fasciculus of the spinal cord at cervical C5 level without damaging the dorsal
columns. The hand regions of areas 3b and 1 contralateral to the spinal cord lesion were
mapped with microelectrodes. Areas 3b and 1 ipsilateral to the spinal cord lesions were also
mapped to serve as controls.
Before surgery, the monkeys were trained and tested on reaching for food to evaluate hand
use. In addition, the somatotopy of the hand representations in cortical areas 3b and 1 were
evaluated non-invasively with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before, and
several times after, sectioning the contralateral dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Seven to
nine weeks after the effective spinal cord lesions, the digits of both hands were injected with
a tracer (cholera toxin subunit B, CTB) so that transport of the tracer to the cuneate nuclei of
both sides could be evaluated as a measure of the effectiveness of the spinal cord lesion in
sectioning ascending afferents to the dorsal column nuclei. Six days later, the monkeys were
anesthetized, and the responsiveness and somatotopy of the hand representations in cortical
areas 3b and 1 were determined by recording from neurons with single microelectrodes.
This microelectrode mapping was followed by an optical imaging session to further evaluate
the responsiveness and somatotopy of the hand region of areas 3b and 1. Upon the
completion of these procedures, the monkeys were given a lethal dose of anesthetic and
perfused with fixative. The brains and spinal cords were histologically processed, and the

results were analyzed. All experimental procedures were approved by the Vanderbilt
University Animal Care and Use Committee, and followed the guidelines of the National
Institute of Health Guides for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Dorsal column section
In preparation for the dorsal column section of the spinal cord, each monkey was initially
anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (15mg/kg, i.m.) and then maintained in a
stereotaxic head holder at a surgical level of anesthesia with 1-3% isoflurane. The depth of
anesthesia was monitored by recording the heart and respiration rates, and testing for
withdrawal reflexes. Rectal body temperature was maintained at 37-38°C. Under aseptic
conditions, a portion of the cervical spinal cord was exposed, and the dorsal columns were
sectioned on one side with a pair of fine surgical scissors at cervical level C4-C6. Dura was
replaced with Gelfilm and covered with Gelfoam. The opening was closed, and the skin
sutured. The monkeys were carefully monitored until they were fully recovered from
anesthesia and then returned to their home cage. Monkeys received antibiotics and
analgesics for 2-3 days after surgery. Animals’ cage behavior and food intake typically
returned to normal shortly after surgery. Further details about surgical procedures can be
found in previous publications from the laboratory (Jain et al., 1997; 2008).
Tracer injection in digits
In order to determine the levels of the spinal cord where the sensory inputs from the digits
terminated in the dorsal horn, and the amounts of inputs from the digits to the cuneate
nuclei, 10-20 μl of 1% cholera toxin subunit B (CTB, Sigma) was subcutaneously injected
into digits 1, 3, and 5 of both hands of these experimental monkeys while they were
anesthetized with 1-3% isoflurane. Procedures followed those described previously
(Florence et al., 1991; Qi and Kaas, 2006).
Microelectrode recording and mapping
The responsiveness of somatosensory cortical areas 3b and 1 was determined seven to nine
weeks after the extensive contralateral spinal cord lesions by recording neuronal responses
with low impedance microelectrodes (1 – 3 MΩ at 1 kHz) from large numbers of recording
sites across the hand representations in areas 3b and 1. Cortex ipsilateral to the dorsal
column lesion was also partially mapped in order to directly compare the responsiveness and
the receptive field sizes of neurons in normal and deprived areas 3b and 1 in the same
animals. Additionally, we mapped the somatosensory cortex of a surgical control monkey
that received a laminectomy at a cervical level, but the dorsal column was untouched.
The monkeys were first tranquilized with ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.m.) and xylazine (0.4 mg/
kg, i.m.), and then anesthetized and maintained at the surgical level with isoflurane (0.8 –
1.1%) delivered in a 70:30 NO2/O2 mixture. Somatosensory areas 3b and 1 were exposed
and covered with warm agar or silicone oil to prevent desiccation. The cortical surface was
photographed, and the blood vessel pattern was used to guide electrode penetrations, which
were marked on the photograph. Within and near the hand representations of areas 3b and 1
(Sur et al., 1982), the microelectrode penetrations were placed densely in ~300 μm spacing
with allowances for blood vessels. An effort was made to cover most or all of the hand
representations in areas 3b and 1 during the recording session. Magnitudes of neuronal
responses to the tapping and manipulation of the hand, as indicated by the acoustic strength
of neuron firing audio output, were constantly evaluated as the microelectrode passed
through the superficial to the middle layers of cortex (up to 1000 μm depth). For each
penetration, we characterized neurons’ receptive field location, size, and stimulus preference
to light touch, tapping, and joint movement stimuli, at the site where the strongest evoked
response occurred. Neurons were classified as cutaneous if they responded to light contact

on the skin or hair movement, high threshold if they required taps to the skin, and non-
cutaneous or “deep” if they responded only to the manipulation of joints and muscles. The
minimum receptive field was determined by the area of skin where light touches with a
cotton tipped probe activated the recorded neurons (Merzenich et al., 1978). When a
receptive field was defined, it was outlined on a drawing of the hand or other relevant body
part. At the end of the recording sessions, electrolytic marking lesions were placed at
selected sites by passing current (10 μA, 10 sec) via the microelectrode. These marking
lesions were used to relate the recording results to cortical architecture.
Tissue processing and histology
At the end of the terminal microelectrode mapping session, each monkey was given a lethal
dose of anesthetic (sodium pentobarbital), and when areflexive, perfused transcardially with
phosphate buffered 0.9% saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by 2-4 % paraformaldehyde in PB,
followed by 2-4% paraformaldehyde with 10% sucrose in PB. The brain and spinal cord
were removed separately. Cortex was separated from subcortical structures, manually
flattened, and kept flat between glass slides (see Gharbawie et al, 2011 for progressive steps
in flattening squirrel monkey cortex). The cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord were stored
overnight in 30% sucrose in PB for cryoprotection. The cortex was cut parallel to the surface
into 40 μm sections on a freezing microtome, and the sections were stained for myelin
(Gallyas, 1979) to reveal the cortical locations of the lesions tracks along electrode
penetrations. The brainstem was sectioned in the coronal plane and the spinal cord in the
horizontal plane, both at 40 μm. Every fourth section of the brainstem and every second
section of the spinal cord was processed with immunohistochemistry to reveal CTB (Qi and
Kaas, 2006). Another series of brainstem and spinal cord sections was processed for
cytochrome oxidase (Wong-Riley, 1979) to reveal brainstem and spinal cord architecture
(Qi and Kaas, 2006).
Data analysis
In order to reconstruct spinal cord lesions, images of spinal cord sections were acquired
using a Nikon E800 microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) and a Nikon DXM1200 camera.
All horizontally cut spinal cord sections were aligned along the midline and a pinhole made
by a penetration perpendicular to the plane of section. The maximal extent of the lesion, the
white matter, and the grey matter were measured, and a coronal view of the lesion site was
reconstructed from the sections with Adobe Illustrator software (see Jain et al., 1997 for
details).
Representations of the hand and adjoining parts of the face and arm in cortical areas 3b and
1 were reconstructed by relating receptive field locations to cortical recording sites
transposed from their marked locations on photographs of the brain to cortical brain sections
which were cut parallel to the brain surface. The electrode penetrations and recording sites
were located relative to electrolytic lesions used to mark recording sites and blood vessels
and other tissue landmarks that were apparent in both the brain section and the brain surface
photographs. The known distances between microlesions were used to correct for the slight
shrinkage of brain sections due to processing.
In order to quantitatively measure the distribution (areal size) and density (lightness) of
CTB-labeled terminal fields in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the cuneate nuclei of
the brainstem, we used NIH Image J v.144 software (available as freeware from
http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) (see Tang et al., 2010 for similar methods). For areal measurement
of foci of labeled terminals, digital photomicrographs of CTB-immunoreacted brainstem
sections were acquired with a Sony digital camera attached to a Nikon E-800 microscope.
Each image was then loaded into Image J and converted into an 8-bit image. Then, a

threshold was set to a value of 133 for all three CTB injected cases by moving the bottom
slider in the drop-down window (Image\Adjust\Threshold) in Image J software. The magic
wand tool was used to outline the zones above threshold. The area and number of labeled
pixels were obtained through the measure function. The set scale function in Image J was
used to convert pixel numbers to standard measurement units. In one case (SM-D), we also
measured label density. This procedure was carried out by loading the RGB color image into
Image J software. The labeled zones were outlined with the freehand selection tool, and the
value of density (reflectance) was automatically calculated by the software with a plugin
written by Wayne Rasband (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/rgb-measure.html). This plugin
separately measures the red, green, and blue channels of an RGB image. The values
obtained for all three channels were then averaged (Average Reflectance = (red+green
+blue)/3). The inversed Average Reflectance was used as the measure of label density in this
study.
To statistically compare the extents (areal size) and densities of CTB label between the
intact side and lesioned side in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the cuneate nuclei of
the brainstem, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was applied using GraphPad
InStat software (GraphPad software Inc.). All data are reported as Mean ± SD.
RESULTS
Cortical recording results are based on a total of 569 microelectrode penetrations from 3
deprived cortices (168, 166, 235), with an average of 190 penetrations per animal. For non-
deprived cortex, the territories of only 2-3 digits were densely mapped, as our goal was to
characterize the neuronal response properties, stimulus preference, and receptive field sizes.
For the dorsal column section, we intended to make a lesion at the middle cervical level (C5)
that would spare some ascending inputs from digit 1, while potentially sectioning most or all
inputs from digits 2-5. As the lesions were large, but incomplete, and varied somewhat in
extent and spinal cord level, the results are described for each case, starting with the one
with the most extensive spinal cord lesion. We describe the histological evaluation of the
extents of lesions first, followed by electrophysiological recording and mapping results from
areas 3b and 1. The results indicate that extensive but incomplete lesions of the ascending
branches of peripheral nerve afferents of the spinal cord were followed after weeks of
recovery by major reactivations of the hand representations in primary somatosensory cortex
(area 3b) and adjoining area 1. These observations demonstrate the importance of a few
remaining first order afferents, as well as possible second order afferents, in the reactivation
of somatosensory cortex and likely the behavioral recovery of the animal.
The extent and spinal cord levels of the unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns
As our interpretations of the recording results from somatosensory cortex critically depend
on independent estimations of the extents of the dorsal columns lesions, we determined the
effectiveness of these lesions in two ways. First, the extents of the lesions were determined
in the traditional way by outlining the locations of missing tissue and adjoining scar tissue
on sections through the spinal cord. For the present cases with dorsal column lesions, this
was done in sections cut in the horizontal plane along the length of the spinal cord. This
proved to be the most useful plane for such reconstructions. Second, we compared the
amounts and locations of patches of labeled axon terminals from both hands in the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord, indicating the spinal cord levels where digit inputs enter, and in the
cuneate nuclei, where dorsal column lesions would alter the amounts and locations of
labeled axon terminals. These axons had been labeled by injections of CTB into digits 1, 3,
and 5 of both hands.

Squirrel monkey SM-O—In this animal, CTB-immunoreacted horizontally cut spinal
cord sections revealed that the dorsal column lesion at the C4 level on the right side of the
spinal cord was rostral to the sites where afferents from the digits enter the spinal cord. Foci
of CTB-labeled axon terminals for D1, D3, and D5 digits were present in the dorsal horns of
both sides below the lesion level (Fig. 1A). As shown in reconstructed transverse views of
spinal cord in Figure 1B, the lesion was almost complete in the dorsal columns except for
minor sparing on the dorsolateral corner near the dorsal root entrance zone. The ipsilateral
dorsal horn and a portion of the intermediate zone were also damaged. In the cuneate nuclei,
the pattern of the labeled axon terminals on the lesioned side (the right side of sections) was
very different from that of the intact side (the left side). As shown in Figure 1C, three
patches of labeled axon terminal fields from the three CTB-injected digits can be identified
across many sections on the intact side, but there are only a few sparse patches of label
apparent on the lesioned side (pointed out with arrows), indicating that the lesion was
extensive and almost complete. By their locations, those sparse patches likely reflected
preserved inputs from digits 3 and 5, as the normal locations of terminations from digits 1, 3,
and 5 in the dorsal horn and cuneate nucleus are known from previous studies (Florence et
al., 1989). We conclude that the extensive lesion in SM-O was rostral to inputs from all of
the digits, and it cut nearly all of the ascending branches of afferents from the hand in the
cuneate fasciculus. A sparse focus of label in a few sections of the cuneate nucleus indicated
that some afferents from digits 3 and 5, and perhaps other parts of hand remained. Yet the
deafferentation of the cuneate nucleus was extensive. A quantitative evaluation of the
effectiveness of the lesion in this and other cases is presented in a following section of the
Results.
Squirrel monkey SM-C—In SM-C, two lesions of the dorsal columns were made in order
to achieve an extensive but incomplete sectioning of the afferents of the cuneate fasciculus.
The first lesion was placed at the C4 level, which was rostral to the entrance zone where
most of the afferents from the digits terminate in the dorsal horn. After the lesion, the
monkey failed to demonstrate the expected impairment of reaching and grasping behavior.
As a result, nearly ten weeks after the first lesion, a second lesion was placed at the C4-C5
junction approximately 1 mm caudal to the first lesion. A lesion at this level would spare
some of the afferents from digit 1. Postmortem examination of the spinal cord sections
confirmed that the first lesion was small and involved only a portion of the lateral part of the
cuneate fasciculus. The second lesion was more extensive and the majority of the ascending
afferents from the hand were cut (Fig. 2A, B, C). The reconstructed transverse view of the
spinal cord after both lesions indicated that a lateral portion of the cuneate fasciculus was
spared (Fig. 2C). Consistent with this observation, CTB-labeled foci from three digits
(shown as three patches) on the lesioned side (right side) could be identified in expected
locations on a few brainstem sections (Fig. 2D), but the density of the label was greatly
reduced. In contrast, labeled foci from the three digits in the normal cuneate nuclei (left side)
were very strong and topographically organized (dark patches). We concluded that in this
animal, the lesions greatly reduced the quantity of inputs from the hand, but sparse inputs
from digits 1, 3, and 5, and possibly other parts of the hand remained.
Squirrel monkey SM-D—Afferents to the cuneate fasciculus were less extensively
sectioned in SM-D, where a lesion was placed at the C5-C6 junction (Fig. 3A, B). The
lesion was placed caudal to most of the inputs from digit 1, as the labeled inputs from digit 1
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord were clearly rostral to the lesion (Fig. 3B). As the lesion
was in the middle of the expected dorsal horn territory of inputs from digit 2, some inputs
from digit 2 were likely spared. Two levels of horizontal sections through the spinal cord are
included (Fig. 3B) to show the lesion at a more superficial level (section 17, left), and a
deeper level (section 23, right). The reconstruction of the lesion, based on a series of

sections, showed that the lesion was fairly complete, except for a superficial region of the
cuneate fasciculus and much of the more medial gracile fasciculus. The lesion extended well
into the central grey of the spinal cord without resulting in obvious behavioral consequences
in addition to those expected from the location of dorsal column damage. Injections of CTB
into the distal phalanges of digits 1, 3, and 5 resulted in densely labeled foci in the expected
locations in the cuneate nucleus of the intact side. However, labeled foci corresponding to
digits 3 and 5 were less densely labeled, and the level of label for digit 1 was reduced. We
conclude that the lesion in SM-D had limited impact on the inputs from digit 1, and only
moderately reduced the inputs from digits 3 and 5 and possibly other parts of the hand.
Quantification of labeled inputs to the cuneate nucleus and the correlation to cortical
responsiveness
To evaluate the effectiveness of the dorsal column lesion in each animal, we further
quantified the differences in CTB label transported to terminal axon arbors in the cuneate
nucleus on both the lesioned and non-lesioned sides of the brainstem by determining the
cross-sectional area of the labeled foci in individual brainstem sections from caudal to
rostral through the nuclei (Fig. 4). The measured foci were those areas that exceeded a
threshold of optical density measured with NIH Image J software (see methods). These
procedures allowed us to quantitatively compare estimates of the proportions of sparse
dorsal column afferents for three cases. While these estimates are based on afferents from
digits 1, 3, and 5 only, they likely apply to all dorsal column afferents from the hand, and the
results of recordings from cortex do not suggest that the lesions selectively avoided afferents
from digits 2 and 4 and from the palm.
SM-O had a nearly complete lesion of the dorsal columns when serial sections through the
cuneate nuclei were examined. Sections through the length of the cuneate nucleus had foci
of label from the three injected fingers on the intact side, but only two sections had
measurable label in the lesion side (blue bars in Fig. 4A). Across sections, the areal extent of
the measurable label on the lesioned side was less than 1% of that intact side, and this
difference was highly significant (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test).
Moreover, the density of the few labeled axon patches was much less on the lesion side than
matching patches on the normal side (see Fig. 1). Thus the 1% value overestimated the
amount of the remaining measurable first order axons.
With less than 1% spared hand inputs, a large number of electrode penetrations (black x) in
areas 3b and 1 recorded no responses to hand stimulation (Fig. 4a). . However, within the
hand representation regions of areas 3b and 1, some recording sites were activated by tactile
stimuli. Although no label in the cuneate nucleus was attributed to the injection in the
glabrous tip of digit 1, three sites in area 3b had neurons that responded well to touch on the
dorsal surface of digit 1. This suggests that the injection of tracer into the glabrous skin of
digit 1 did not spread to involve the dorsal skin. Other regions of area 3b responded well to
digits 2 and 4, and weakly to digit 3, while none were activated by stimulating digit 5.
Similarly in area 1, a small number of penetration sites responded to tactile stimulation of
digits 3, 4, and 5 as well as palm or forearm. Given the completeness of the spinal cord
lesion, the overall responsiveness of the hand regions in both areas 3b and 1 to inputs from
the hand was greater than expected. However, compared to other animals with less extensive
of lesions (Fig. 4Bb & Cc), the proportion of recording sites that were responsive to the
hand was much smaller.
SM-C appeared to have some sparing of axons in the cuneate fasciculus. The labeling of the
cuneate nucleus after injections in digits 1, 3, and 5 was very sparse (scattered blue bars in
Fig. 4B) compared to the intact side (grey bars in Fig. 4B), but was more than that of the
lesion side in case SM-O (Fig. 4A). Sparsely labeled locations in the cuneate nucleus likely

reflected inputs from digits 1, 3, and 5, but the overall extent of the measured patches of
label on the lesion side was only 2.2% of that on the intact side. The difference of labeled
terminal areas in the cuneate nuclei between the two sides was highly significant (p <
0.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test). The density of the labeled patches was
also reduced on the lesion side compared to that on the normal side (Fig. 2), suggesting that
even fewer of the afferents from digits 1, 3, and 5 remained. Contralateral to the lesion, large
extents of both areas 3b and 1 were unresponsive to tactile stimuli (black “x” in Fig. 4b).
Compared to SM-O, however, more penetration sites were responsive to tactile stimulation
of digits 1 to 5 (Fig. 4b), suggesting that the sparse patches of label from these digits in the
contralateral cuneate nucleus were effective in reactivating neurons in area 3b. Another
region of area 3b responded to digit 4, suggesting that some digit 4 inputs were preserved as
well. Surprisingly, in area 1, digit stimulation only evoked weak responses in a few
penetration sites and the strongest responses were limited to those evoked by stimulating the
wrist and forearm.
SM-D had the most incomplete lesion of the cuneate fasciculus due to a section at a slightly
lower level (C5-C6, between digits 1 and 2) in the dorsal column of the spinal cord. Foci of
CTB label from digits 1, 3, and 5 in the cuneate nuclei were found in many sections on the
lesioned side, although the labeled patches were smaller and less widely distributed across
sections than on the intact side (Fig. 4C). Quantitative measurement of the sizes of labeled
axon terminal fields in the cuneate nucleus of the brainstem revealed a significant reduction
(p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test) on the lesion side. Overall, the areal
extent of labeled patches from digits 1, 3, and 5 on the lesion side was 23.4% of that on the
intact side. Since most of peripheral afferents from D1 that entered the right side of the
spinal cord were above the lesion, they were largely spared. As the labeled patches from the
D1 injection were distinguishable from those from the D3 and D5 injections in several
brainstem sections (Fig. 3D), we measured the sizes and densities of labeled patches of axon
terminals for D1 territories in the cuneate nuclei on both sides of the brainstem. Both the
total size and densities of labeled patches for D1 were significantly reduced (p < 0.004 for
both measurements) on the lesion side (Areal size: 0.023 ± 0.0126 mm2; Density: 0.007 ±
0.0008) compared to the intact side (Areal size: 0.048 ± 0.0236 mm2; Density: 0.012 ±
0.003). Based on this calculation, the first order afferents from digit 1 were reduced by about
half. For comparison, similar measurements were made from patches of label in horizontally
cut spinal cord sections. The values were used to compare the sizes and densities of CTB-
labeled patches for digit territories 1, 3, and 5 in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The
results indicate that the sizes and the densities of D3 and D5 territories were similar on both
sides on the dorsal horn. However, as shown in Figure 5C and 5D, the labeled axon territory
of D1 in the dorsal horn was slightly larger and density was significantly lower on the lesion
side than on the normal side (p < 0.04). These results suggested that some of the peripheral
afferent inputs from D1 were interrupted by the lesion at cervical segments C5-C6, even
though the section was below the main focus of D1 input in spinal cord.
Recording from somatosensory cortex in this monkey revealed some unresponsive zones,
but also revealed large regions of hand cortex in both areas 3b and 1 that were responsive to
touch on each of the five digits (Fig. 4C). Even though over 75% of the activating inputs
from the hand were lost, the remaining inputs were highly effective in reactivating neurons
in areas 3b and 1.
In summary, across these three animals, less cortical reactivation followed the larger lesions
of the cuneate fasciculus of the spinal cord.

The somatotopic organizations of areas 3b and 1 hand regions contralateral and ipsilateral
to dorsal column lesions
To characterize the changes in digit somatotopy after contralateral dorsal column lesions, we
compared the neuronal responsiveness and receptive field (RF) properties of neurons
between the input-deprived contralateral area 3b and non-deprived ipsilateral area 3b in the
same monkeys. Mapping the ipsilateral hand region also served as a control to assure that
the weak responses encountered in the deprived cortex were not due to longer hours of
recording under isoflurane anesthesia. The recordings from the deprived cortex preceded the
recordings from the intact sides. As an independent control, we also mapped the hand
representations of areas 3b and 1 in one surgical control monkey who received a lateral
spinal cord lesion that did not affect the dorsal columns. Control maps obtained from four
hemispheres are presented in Figure 6.
Topography and neuronal receptive field properties in non-deprived cortex—
Similar to previous findings (e.g., Sur et al., 1982), we observed topographically organized
maps of digit representation maps and strong responses to tactile stimulation in non-
deprived cortex in all four hemispheres (Fig. 6). Somatotopically, the tips of digits 1-5 were
represented in a lateromedial sequence from D1-D5 along the rostral border of area 3b and
the caudal border of area 1, with more proximal phalanges of the digits and pads of the palm
in between (see examples in Fig. 6A-6D). Only an occasional recording site was found
where neurons responded to the dorsal hairy surface of the hand and digits. Overall, the two
hand representations roughly constituted mirror images of each other in somatotopy,
reversing at the area 3b/1 border (e.g., Fig. 6D). It was quite clear that almost 100% of the
mapping sites in the digit region of area 3b produced good or very good responses (indicated
by solid dots in Fig. 6). The depths at which strong responses were first encountered within
the electrode penetrations were usually between 500 – 700 μm below the pial surface. Based
on these findings, we believe that the weak responses or lack of responses in the deprived
hand region of areas 3b and 1 were due to the interruption of peripheral inputs in the dorsal
column of the spinal cord, and not artifacts of long periods of anesthesia.
Topography and neuronal receptive field properties in deprived cortex—After
seven to nine weeks of post-lesion survival time following effective sectioning of the
afferents from the hand in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, the deprived somatosensory
areas 3b and 1 were mapped under isoflurane anesthesia. In general, the deprived cortex was
partly responsive but not fully reactivated, topography was abnormal, the neuronal responses
were sometimes weak, and receptive fields were sometimes discontinuous and relatively
large. In addition, the depths of the most responsive recording sites tended to be deeper
(usually around 700 – 1000 μm below pia surface, and likely within layer 4) than the first
strongly responsive sites on the normal side (usually 500 – 700 μm, and likely within layer 3
and beginning of layer 4). This estimate of depth in relation to architectural cortical layers is
consistent with the laminar activity profile study of area 3b in squirrel monkeys of by
Schroeder et al. (1995). The tendency to find strong responses at more superficial recording
depths in the normal compared to the deprived hemispheres reflects the stronger activations
of normal hemispheres.
SqM-O: Hand regions in areas 3b and 1 of both hemispheres in this monkey were mapped
seven weeks after an extensive unilateral dorsal column lesion at cervical level 4. Peripheral
afferents from all digits entered below the lesion, and less than 1% of the primary afferents
survived (Fig. 4A). The hand representations in deprived areas 3b and 1 were abnormal in
that neurons in most penetrations were unresponsive to somatosensory stimuli (Fig. 7). Only
three sites had neurons responsive to digit 1, and the receptive fields were on the dorsal
surface of the digit, which is normally poorly represented. Only one site responded to digit

2, while several sites had neurons with receptive fields on digit 3, and a few had neurons that
responded to digit 4. The receptive fields for these sites were not unusually large, and they
roughly reflected the somatotopy of a normal representation in areas 3b and 1. However,
unresponsive zones in area 3b were in the locations expected for some representations of the
skin surface including the glabrous skin of digit 1, most of digit 2, and some parts of
glabrous digits 3-5. Sites in area 1 were activated during digit 5 stimulation, but
corresponding sites for digit 5 stimulation in area 3b were not found. In contrast to the weak
responses encountered in the deprived hand representations of areas 3b and 1, all the
mapping sites (marked with blue dots) in the more lateral face representations responded
very well to light tactile stimuli on the face (Fig. 7).
SqM-C: Hand regions in areas 3b and 1 of both hemispheres in this monkey were mapped
nine weeks after a second, more effective unilateral dorsal column lesion of the spinal cord.
We estimated that the two lesions together removed 98% of the terminations of first order
afferents from the hand in the cuneate fasciculus (Fig. 4B). Nevertheless, the five digits were
represented in a normal lateromedial sequence of D1-D5 along the rostral border of area 3b
(Fig. 8). Many of the responses were weak, and much of the area 3b hand representation was
unresponsive. Higher than expected proportions of receptive fields were found on the dorsal
surfaces of digits. Most parts of the glabrous skin were not represented in the deprived area
3b, and there were only a few penetrations where RFs on either the tip or distal phalanges of
glabrous digits could be found (Fig. 8). Even fewer sites were activated in area 1, where
lateral recording sites responded to the forearm and hand or weakly to digit 1. In contrast to
area 3b, none of the receptive fields for neurons in area 1 were on the glabrous surface of
digits 2-5.
SM-D: The deprived cortical areas 3b, 1, 3a, and normally activated area 3b of this monkey
were mapped eight weeks after a unilateral section of the right cuneate fasciculus. The lesion
was at a slightly lower spinal cord level (C5-C6) than the other two cases. This level allowed
most of the inputs from digit 1 to enter the cuneate fasciculus above the lesion, as well as
some of the inputs from digit 2 and perhaps even digit 3. Transported tracer from digits 1, 3,
and 5 on the lesion side revealed that inputs to the cuneate nucleus from digit 1 were
somewhat reduced, and only some inputs from digits 3, possibly 4, and 5 remained (Fig. 3).
Thus, the lesion was extensive, and we estimate that less than 25% of the afferents from the
hand in the cuneate fasciculus remained (Fig. 4C). As a result of an extensive but incomplete
loss of afferents, the lateral parts of the hand representations in area 3b that normally
respond digits 1 and 2 and the thenar pad of the palm continued to respond well to touch on
those parts of the hand (Fig. 9). The more deprived medial parts of the hand territories of
areas 3b and 1 had regions of unresponsive neurons (Fig. 4c). Nevertheless, all five digits
were represented in lateromedial sequence from D1-D5 on both areas 3b and 1 as in normal
monkeys. However, there were a number of abnormal features in the somatotopic patterns.
The representations of digits 1 and 2 in area 3b were unusually large, suggesting that they
had expanded into deprived regions of cortex (Fig. 9). While the representations of digits 1
and 2 in area 3b were quite large, the representations of digits 1 and 2 in area 1 were
surprisingly small, and they were displaced medially from their normal more lateral
locations (Fig. 10). There were only three penetrations in area 1 where neurons responded to
light touch on digit 1, and only 3 penetrations for digit 2. The large representation of the
hand, wrist, and arm in the lateral part of area 1 was also an unusual feature. Inputs from the
thenar pad and palm pad 1 were probably partly spared by the C5-C6 lesion, and they had
expanded territories in areas 3b and 1 (Figs. 9 and 10). The receptive fields of neurons in the
deprived regions of digits 3-5 were relatively large, and usually included multiple digits or
phalanges (Fig. 9). In contrast, the receptive fields of neurons in the less deprived regions of
digit 1 and part of digit 2 were small.

Finally, the rostrocaudal progressions of somatotopy in the highly responsive D1 and D2
territories in area 3b were abnormal. To illustrate this, we subdivided the D1 and D2
territories of area 3b into rostral, middle, and caudal zones on digit 1 (D1r, D1m, D1c,
respectively) and digit 2, (D2r, D2m, D2c). Here, we found that the representations of the
distal parts of these digits were not limited to the rostral part of area 3b as reported in early
studies of normal monkeys (Sur et al., 1982, Jain et al., 1997) and as also found in our
control and normal hemispheres (Fig. 6). Instead, neurons responsive to the distal portion of
the digits were also found in the caudal portions of area 3b, where receptive fields on digit
tips intermingled with those on the proximal part of digits. These results indicated that even
though the inputs from digits 1 and 2 were largely spared, their representations in the
deprived area 3b were not normal.
Comparison of digit somatotopy in area 3b and area 1—In normal monkeys, areas
3b and 1 share many common features in topography, preferred stimulus, and RF properties.
However, we found that the patterns of somatotopy and the extents of reactivation were
different between areas 3b and 1 after dorsal column lesions. Thus, there were larger
unresponsive zones in area 1 compared to area 3b (Figs. 7, 8). Receptive fields for neurons
in area 1 were usually larger and more often involved multiple phalanges (Figs. 7, 8, 10).
While the representations of digits 1 and 2 were over represented in area 3b in monkey SM-
D, their representations in area 1 remained quite small with only a few penetrations where
digit 1 and 2 could be found in area 1. Such results suggest that somatotopic reorganization
of area 1 after peripheral sensory loss is often different and likely more variable than that of
area 3b. Previously, area 1 reorganization after median nerve section in monkeys was
described as different and more variable than area 3b reorganization (Merzenich et al.,
1983a, b).
In summary, the somatosensory areas 3b and 1 underwent reactivation and reorganization
after sectioning the contralateral dorsal columns at a high cervical level. With survival times
up to nine weeks after dorsal column lesions, deprived cortex was partly responsive but not
totally reactivated, topography was not normal, the neuronal responses were sometimes
weak, and the receptive fields of neurons were sometimes discontinuous and relatively large.
The degree of reactivation corresponded to the amount of remaining dorsal column afferents
that terminate in the cuneate nucleus of the brainstem. Considerable reactivation occurred
even when less than 1% of the primary afferent inputs remained in the cuneate nucleus of
the brainstem. We did not encounter face representations in the hand region of area 3b. A
possible explanation for this finding is that the seven to nine weeks recovery time after an
effective dorsal column lesion may not be long enough to produce face representations
expansion in the deprived hand region in primary somatosensory cortex (Jain et al., 1997).
DISCUSSION
We characterized the neuronal responsiveness and somatotopy of the hand representations in
areas 3b and 1 of somatosensory cortex of squirrel monkeys weeks after sectioning of the
dorsal columns of the contralateral spinal cord. Such lesions immediately abolish the
responsiveness of the hand representation to touch on the hand in areas 3b and 1 of
somatosensory cortex, but over weeks of recovery, responsiveness to touch on some parts of
the hand returns to much of the deprived hand cortex, followed by responsiveness to touch
on the lower face after even longer periods of 6-8 months (Jain et al., 1997, 1998, 2008).
The return of such responsiveness has been considered to be due to the preservation of some
dorsal column afferents from the hand, the growth of new connections in the dorsal column
nuclei; and the potentiation of those and other connections. Over longer periods of time, the
growth of afferents from the face to the cuneate nucleus, results in inputs from the face
activating hand cortex and misperceptions of touch on the face being felt on the hand

(Ramachandran et al., 1992; Ramachandran, 1993). Our present study adds to previous
results by making the relationships between extents of cortical reactivation and dorsal
column lesions clear. By using tracers subcutaneously injected into the skin of digits, we
were able to study cortical activation several weeks after lesions disrupted 75% to more than
99% of afferents from the hand in the dorsal columns. In each of three cases, some cortical
reactivation occurred in area 3b, although the somatotopy was incomplete and abnormal. In
addition, the reactivation in area 1 differed in extent and somatotopy from that in area 3b.
The reactivations of somatosensory cortex in our experimental monkeys were confirmed by
optical imaging and high-resolution 9.4T functional MRI. In addition, hand use was
impaired immediately after the larger spinal cord lesions, but greatly improved over weeks
of post-operational testing. These additional imaging and behavioral results will be
presented elsewhere.
The effectiveness of our spinal cord lesions in eliminating first order afferents from the
hand
In the present study, we were able to quantify the extents of preserved first order afferents
by labeling afferents from the digits of the hand with CTB, determining the locations and
magnitudes of these terminations in the spinal cord and cuneate nucleus on the side the
spinal cord lesion in comparison with the intact side. Because afferents from specific skin
locations terminate in specific locations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the
dorsal column nuclei of primates with little if any overlap from adjacent skin locations
(Florence et al., 1988, 1989, 1991, 1994; Strata et al., 2003; Qi and Kaas, 2006), we were
able to measure the remaining axon terminal fields in the cuneate nucleus of the brainstem
and directly compare the extents and locations of axon inputs on the lesioned and intact
sides. Such quantifications have not characterized previous studies of this type. With a
nearly complete lesion with even less than 1% of the afferents from the hand remaining in
the dorsal columns, parts of the hand representation in primary somatosensory cortex were
reactivated, and this likely contributed to the recovery of hand use. In another monkey with
nearly 24% of remaining fibers, more than half of the recording sites in the hand region of
area 3b encountered neurons responsive to stimuli on the hand (Figs. 4c, 9), and the majority
of the responses were to low threshold cutaneous stimulation.
Possible mechanisms of cortical reorganization after sensory loss
In the somatosensory system of monkeys, a nerve cut, digit amputation, or dorsal root or
dorsal column section deactivates a part of the representation of the hand in area 3b of
somatosensory cortex so that neurons are no longer responsive to tactile or other peripheral
stimuli. Over weeks or months of recovery, preserved cutaneous inputs from the hand either
expand their cortical territory of activation or gradually become effective in activating
cortical neurons after an initial complete loss of activation (Merzenich et al., 1983a,b; Pons
et al., 1991; Florence et al., 1996, 1998; Jain et al., 1997, 1998, 2000, 2008; Darian-Smith
and Brown, 2000). The recovery of responsiveness is paralleled by improvements in hand
use (Darian-Smith and Ciferri, 2005). Thus, the reactivation of cortex appears to have
important functional consequences. Although the exact mechanisms of long-term plasticity
after dorsal column lesion are not fully understood (see Jain et al., 2008; Graziano and
Jones, 2009 for discussion), such long-term plasticity appears to involve the creation of new
connections and an increase in the effectiveness of existing connections (see Kaas, 2001;
Kaas et al., 2008).
In the monkeys with more complete dorsal column lesions (e.g., SM-O), it seems unlikely
that all of the cortical reactivation depends on the few (less than 1%) remaining first order
afferents. However, the dorsal column nuclei also receive non-primary inputs from neurons
in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Rustioni et al., 1979; Bennett et al., 1983).

The present results raise the possibility that some of the second order afferents that originate
caudal to the dorsal column lesions avoid the lesion and join the dorsal columns at a more
rostral level. While the paths of these second order afferents to the dorsal column nuclei
have not been fully determined, the lesions of the dorsal columns in the present study likely
interrupted second order afferents as well as first order afferents, but more second order
afferents may have been preserved. Electrophysiological studies suggest that the second
order neurons that contribute to the dorsal columns are excited by both tactile and noxious
stimuli or tactile stimuli alone (see Bennett et al., 1983). Second order afferents to the
cuneate nucleus are thought to activate intrinsic inhibitory neurons and thereby restrain the
receptive field sizes of the cuneate relay neurons (Dykes and Craig, 1998). Possibly some of
second order afferents become capable to activating relay neurons during recoveries
following dorsal column lesions. In addition, the spinothalamic pathway could contribute to
the reactivation of areas 3b and 1, although the results of some studies argue against this
possibility (e.g., Dreyer et al., 1974; Olausson et al., 2008).
Reactivation and reorganization of area 1
Parts of area 1 were also responsive to tactile stimulation of the hand after behavioral
recovery from dorsal column lesions in the present experiments. While area 1 has been
found to be responsive to somatosensory stimuli after dorsal column lesions (Jain et al.,
2008), the distribution and somatotopy of this reactivated representation have not been fully
described. In the present study, we directly compared the responsiveness of the hand
territories in areas 3b and 1, weeks to months after a range of large to nearly complete dorsal
column lesions. We found that fewer locations in area 1 were responsive to touch on the
hand than locations in area 3b. In addition, the types of responses differed in that skin
locations that were highly effective in activating a number of sites in area 3b could be rather
ineffective in area 1, and a few skin locations activated area 1 sites better than area 3b sites.
Thus, the somatotopy in area 1 less effectively mirrored that of area 3b in lesioned compared
to normal monkeys. Similar results were reported after monkeys recovered from a sensory
loss in the hand following median nerve section (Merzenich et al., 1983a, b). As area 3b
projects to layer 4 of area 1 (Vogt and Pandya, 1978), inputs from area 3b are thought to be
the main source of activation in area 1 (Juliano et al., 1990), and lesions of area 3b abolish
evoked responses in area 1 (Garraghty et al., 1990). However, it remains possible that inputs
to layer 3 of area 1 from the ventroposterior nucleus (Cusick et al., 1985) gain synaptic
strength and become capable of activating area 1 during recoveries from dorsal column
lesions in monkeys, so that activation patterns in area 1 become somewhat independent of
those in area 3b. After long-standing but possibly incomplete lesions of the hand
representation in area 3b of macaque monkeys, Randolph and Semmes (1974) reported that
area 1 responded to tactile stimuli.
Overall, the present results, together with previous findings, indicate that nearly complete
lesions of dorsal column afferents do not permanently deactivate somatosensory cortex.
Even a few surviving afferents can have a large role in reactivating cortex. Second order
afferents may also have an important role in reactivation and behavioral recoveries.

A-C, Bar graphs showing the areal size of CTB-labeled axon arbor foci in the cuneate nuclei
of the brainstem from 3 lesioned monkeys. The numbers in the x-axis are the distance (in
μm) measured from the beginning of the obex. The negative values indicate the measured
distances were caudal to the obex. The value in y-axis is the areal size (in mm2) of the
combined foci of CTB label for each section through the cuneate nucleus of the brainstem.
Values from the intact and lesioned sides are compared. a-c, topographical maps of hand
territories in areas 3b and 1 of same 3 monkeys in panels A-C depict regions where neurons
had weak to strong responses to tactile stimulation. X's mark penetrations with unresponsive
neurons. Neuronal response sites for different parts of the hand are grouped and outlined,
and territories for digits from D1 to D5 and palm pads are indicated. Shadings from dark to
white indicate the proportion of good responses for each responding zone of the hand from
high to low. Abbreviations: 3a, area 3a; 3b, area 3b; 1, area 1; CS, central sulcus; Ds, digits;

Bar graphs showing the relative extents and densities of CTB-labeled axon arbors in the
digit 1 territory of rotunda subdivision of the cuneate nuclei (A, B), and the dorsal horn of
the spinal cord (C, D) of squirrel monkey SM-D. The value of label density was defined by
inversed lightness of averaged values of reflected light from red, green, and blue channels
(see methods). Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to compare the difference
between lesioned side with the intact side. P<0.05 is considered significant. A. A
comparison of the areal extent of the foci of label from D1 in the cuneate nucleus of the
lesioned and intact sides. Measurements were taken from the middle-rostral sector of the
cuneate nucleus where the rotunda subdivision is located as this is where CTB labeled foci
from digits 1, 3, and 5 could be distinguished on both sides. B. A comparison of the
densities of the foci of label for digit 1 in the rotunda subdivision of the cuneate nucleus. C.
The areal extent of foci of label from D1, D3, and D5 in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of
the two sides. There are no significant differences in the extents of label in the spinal cord
on the two sides, indicating that the dorsal column lesion did not disrupt most of the
terminations in the dorsal horn. D. However, a comparison of the densities of the labeled
foci in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord after injections in digits 1, 3, and 5 reveal that only
the foci for digit 1 were significantly less dense on the lesioned side compared to the intact
side, suggesting the lesion at the C6 level (Figure 3) may have disrupted some of the D1
afferents terminations in the dorsal horn. The star * indicates a significance level of p < 0.05.
No significant differences were observed for foci for digits 3 and 5. Values in C and D are
reported as Mean ± SD.

The organization of digit representations of area 3b in three squirrel monkeys on the side
ipsilateral to lesions of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. The fourth squirrel monkey
(SM-M) was a surgical control monkey in which a laminectomy was performed at the C4-
C5 level of cervical vertebrae; however, the dorsal columns were not touched. Maps of each
case were reconstructed based on the locations of receptive fields for neurons at each
electrode penetration (see methods). The schematic drawings of hands for each case depict
the examples of the neuronal receptive fields as they progressively shifted from distal to
proximal portions of the digits as electrode penetrations moved from rostral to caudal in
cortical area 3b. The solid dots mark good responses; the open circles mark weak responses;
the open diamonds mark very weak responses to hard taps; the dashed regions mark
responses to hairy or dorsal skin; x's mark microelectrode penetrations with no responses;
stars mark electrolytic lesions. In all cases, the vast majority of responses in areas 3b and 1
were good, and the somatotopic organizations of areas 3b and 1 appeared to be normal.

The somatotopic map of areas 3b and 1 of a squirrel monkey (SM-O) obtained seven weeks
after section of the contralateral dorsal columns. A. The somatotopic map shows the
locations of microelectrode penetrations. Solid dots mark penetrations with good responses;
black open circles mark those with weak responses; black diamonds mark those with very
weak responses to hard taps; x's mark microelectrode penetrations with no responses. Heavy
black dashed lines mark area boundaries based on myelin architecture. Note that the vast
majority of microelectrode penetrations over unaffected face cortex are marked with good
responses. B. Receptive fields obtained with microelectrode recordings are outlined on
drawing of the glabrous and dorsal sides of the hand of SM-O. The dashed lines on the
drawing of hand indicate the exact boundaries of the RFs were hard to define due to very

A somatotopic map obtained eight weeks after a lesion of the contralateral dorsal columns in
squirrel monkey SM-D. On the left, solid dots mark penetrations with good responses; black
open circles mark those with weak responses; black diamonds mark those with very weak
responses to hard taps; x's mark microelectrode penetrations with no responses. On the right,
receptive fields obtained with microelectrode recordings are outlined on drawings of the
glabrous and dorsal side of the hand of a squirrel monkey. Numbers or letters on the
drawings of the hands indicate the receptive fields matching microelectrode penetrations in
the map. The detailed topographical organizations of the most spared digits 1 and 2 are
shown on the left top 2 panels. By dividing the regions representing digits 1 and 2 into three
sectors (rostral, middle, and caudal), we show that the representations of the distal part of
digits are not limited to the rostral portions of digit representations of area 3b as reported in
normal monkeys (e.g., Sur et al., 1982), but they also appear in the middle and caudal
sectors of the area 3b. In the bottom half of the illustration, the digits 3-5 were represented in
partly deprived cortex in an abnormal fashion, reflected by the appearance of silent zones
and abnormal somatotopy. The receptive fields did not progressively shift as the electrode
penetrations moved systematically from rostral to caudal (e.g., digit 3 representation). In
addition, the representations of D3-D5 were fragmented. For conventions, see Figures 4 and
6.
