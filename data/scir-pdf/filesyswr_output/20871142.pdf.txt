Abstract. Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in loss of nervous tissue in the spinal cord and consequently loss of motor and sensory
function. The impairments are permanent because endogenous repair events fail to restore the damaged axonal circuits that are
involved in function. There is no treatment available that restores the injury-induced loss of function. The consequences of
SCI are devastating physically and socially. The assessment of functional loss after SCI has been standardized in the larger part
of the world. For medical care however there are no standards available. During the early phase, treatments that stabilize the
patient’s health and attempt to limit further neurological deterioration need to be implemented. During the later phase of SCI,
the focus needs to be on prevention and/or treatment of secondary complications such as pain, pressure ulcers, and infections.
Neuroprotective, axon growth-promoting and rehabilitative repair approaches are currently being tested but, so far, none of these
has emerged as an effective treatment that reverses the consequences of SCI. Promising new repair approaches have emerged
from the laboratory during the last years and entered the clinical arena including stem cell transplantation and functional electrical
stimulation.

1. Introduction
Each year, many people worldwide suffer from
spinal cord injury (SCI). These injuries cause death of
neural cells, severance and demyelination of descend-
ing and ascending axons, and, consequently, loss of
motor and sensory function. Endogenous repair efforts
fail to repair the spinal cord and, as a result, the func-
tional impairments are permanent. Most people who
experience SCI are destined to spend the remainder of

for SCI are being tested but so far none of these have
emerged as one that reverses the devastating functional
consequences of SCI. Here we review SCI with an em-
phasis on the current status of clinical care and clinical
trials.
2. Epidemiology and etiology of SCI
Inconsistent data reporting makes it difficult to ac-
curately estimate the worldwide incidence of SCI [1,
35,69,77,79,94]. The annual incidence in the United
States is about 40 cases per million population or about
12,000 cases per year [98]. Over 77% of SCI occurred
among males. A number of studies profiling the epi-
demiology of SCI indicated that the population of SCI
people has grown over 255,000 (in 2007) with estimates

between 227,080 and 300,938 patients. In the United
States and most Western European countries, the aver-
age age at injury has increased over the last 3 decades
from 28.7 to 39.5 years. Most injuries occur between
the ages of 16 and 30. The percentage of people older
than 60 that suffered from SCI has increased from 4.7%
in 1980 to 11.5% among injuries since 2000.
In the United States, the main causes of SCI are
motor vehicle crashes (42%), falls (27.1%), violence
(15.3%), unknown (8.1%), sports (7.4%). These num-
bers are similar in other countries although the percent-
age of violence may be smaller [61,98,109]. Over 70%
of injuries are contusive injuries [17,53].
3. Consequences of SCI
3.1. Pathophysiological and anatomical
consequences
A force to the vertebral column causes damage to the
ligaments and vertebrae (Figs 1A, 1B). The torn liga-
ments cause instability of the vertebral column. Dislo-
cated bone fragments of damaged vertebrae may com-
press the spinal cord (Figs 1A, 1B). This causes im-
mediate neural cell death, axon damage and demyeli-
nation (Fig. 2A) [46]. The cellular damage results in
instant loss of motor and sensory function. After the
first destructive events, a sequence of molecular and
cellular pathophysiological events (Fig. 2A) including
an aggressive inflammatory response within the dam-
aged tissue leads to additional tissue loss at the injury
epicenter and at distant sites (secondary injury) [8,9,
20,46,52]. On the other hand, there are also various
cellular events during the early and later stages of SCI
that could be interpreted as attempts to correct for the
inflicted damage (Fig. 2B).
3.2. Functional consequences
The functional consequences of SCI are highly vari-
able and depend on the degree of tissue damage, which
in turn depends on the impact severity. In patients
with SCI with a relatively small amount of tissue dam-
age, some endogenous recovery of function can be ob-
served, which is most likely resulting from plasticity of
the spinal nervous tissue [27,31]. In people with SCI
with large tissue damage the neurological deficits are
generally major and permanent. There are very few
reports of people with a large injury that regain motor
function to a degree that independence can be achieved.
In these few cases the injury was generally inflicted to
the lower (lumbar) level of the spinal cord [54].
3.3. Social consequences
The critical-care medicine practice for people with
SCI has considerably improved during the last decade
and is nowadays more widely available. Accordingly,
more than 95% of SCI patients survive their initial
hospitalization. SCI decreases the lifespan by about 7%
each year [97]. A functionally complete and high level
(cervical) injury impacts the lifespan more dramatically
than a functionally incomplete or low level (thoracic-
lumbar) injury [97]. Together, the relatively young
age when SCI occurs, the improved medical care, and
the lack of effective therapies are responsible for the
continually increasing number of paralyzed people with

events that take place after spinal cord contusion injury. Rostral is to the left. In B, regeneration-supporting events that take place relatively early
after injury and over a limited time period are upregulation of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), axon sprouting, angiogenesis, trophic factor
upregulation, Schwann cell invasion. Other regeneration-supporting events such as debris removal, stem cell birth/proliferation, myelination, and
plasticity may also occur at later time points and over a longer time period.
SCI. This puts a high financial burden on the patient,
his/her family, and society [1,41,87]. SCI is the second
most expensive condition to treat in the United States
after respiratory distress syndrome in infants and is
ranked third in medical conditions requiring the longest
stay in hospitals [104]. The costs of lifetime care for a
SCI patient varies between 1 and 3 million dollars [71,
98]. The Centre for Disease Control in the United
States estimated that about 10 billion dollars are spent
yearly on SCI treatment excluding the management of
pressure ulcers, a common side-effect of SCI, which
adds another billion dollars per year [71].
4. Clinical assessment of function after SCI
The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) im-
pairment scale is often used to assess the level and
the completeness of SCI [2,58,45,68,70]. This scale
grades the preserved dermatome for sensory function
and the strength of 20 “key” muscles in the upper and
lower limbs [68]. It provides clinicians with a standard
for grading sensory and motor function impairment af-
ter SCI. Table 1 provides the 5 ASIA scores and their
implications. Testing the intrinsic foot muscle, could
complement the ASIA score as, in the majority of SCI
patients, it provides an earlier and superior indicator of
supraspinal influence over motoneurons projecting to
lower extremity muscles [18].
Another frequently used scale is the ASIA Lower
Extremity Motor Score (LEMS), an ASIA subscore,
which provides a prediction of the ability to walk. The
LEMS scale is commonly used together with and sup-
plements the ASIA scale. A person without neurolog-
ical deficits scores 50 on the LEMS scale. A score of
30 or more is predicative for community ambulation
1 year after injury and a score of 20 or less predicts
limited ambulation [54,69,70,101].
Classification of SCI can also be achieved by mea-
suring functional ability using the Functional Indepen-
dence Measure (FIM) [29]; a 7-point scale that mea-
sures 18 items concerning mobility, locomotion, self-
care, bowel and/or bladder function, communication,
and social cognition. A score of 1 indicates total depen-
dence on a caregiver and a score of 7 indicates complete
independence [30,72]. Other scales to assess func-
tional ability are the Quadriplegic Index of Function
(QIF), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Walking In-
dex for SCI (WISCI), Capabilities of Upper Extremity
Instrument (CUE), Spinal Cord Independence Measure
(SCIM) and the Canadian Occupational Performance
Measure (COPM).

5. Treatment of SCI
An acute and a chronic phase can be distinguished
after SCI. Since SCI is often a consequence of severe
accidents, clinical care during the acute phase is gen-
erally focused on stabilization of the patient. During
the chronic phase the main attention will need to be
on preventing and, if unsuccessful, treating SCI con-
sequences such as pain, infections, and pressure ulcers
among others.
5.1. Clinical care acutely after SCI
To date there is insufficient evidence that would sup-
port standards of care during the acute phase of SCI. It
is advised to maintain patients in an intensive care unit
for close monitoring of respiratory and hemodynamic
complications. For adequate spinal perfusion, which
is at risk due to injury-induced edema, a mean arterial
pressure of 85–90 mmHg should be maintained [11].
Depending on the type of injury, surgical interventions
should be considered to relieve the spinal cord from
compressing bone fragments [15,38]. The physician
may decide to perform surgery to decompress or sta-
bilize dislocated vertebrae and the vertebral column
(Figs 1C, 1D). Decompression surgeries [15,38] may
accelerate functional improvements and result in short-
er hospitalization and rehabilitation periods [72,80].
However, it does not necessarily result in an improved
final outcome [23].
The lack of standards of care during the acute phase
of SCI is in part due to the large variability among in-
juries and makes its early management complicated. If
bone fragments continue to compress the spinal cord,
early surgery may be vital to prevent exacerbation of
spinal cord tissue destruction. However, in cases with-
out a clear sign of such urgency there is no consensus
on whether and what type of early surgical/clinical in-
terventions must be implemented [38]. The lack of dif-
ferent approaches to treat the same condition is demon-
strated by a case presented in Fig. 1. Due to a fall
this patient had multiple fractures of the cervical spinal
cord, including dislocation fractures of the C5 and C6
vertebrae resulting in compression of the spinal cord.
R.D.S. Nandoe Tewarie et al. / A clinical perspective of SCI 133
Fig. 3. Complications after spinal cord injury. The most common complications that occur during the first years after SCI are listed on the left
and those that occur mostly at later (chronic) stages are listed on the right. Spasticity and pressure sores occur during the first years but are also
common at chronic stages of SCI (UTI = urinary tract infection).
In the acute phase, the patient was admitted at the in-
tensive care unit and monitored. At first, a decom-
pression laminectomy and dorsal spondylodesis from
C2-Th2 was performed. However, the C5 dislocation
fracture was not repositioned sufficiently requiring a
second surgery where a corporectomy C5 and C6 in-
cluding a ventral spondylodesis was performed. The
type of surgical intervention should be considered on a
case-to-case basis, which makes it complicated to study
the efficacy of intervention in the acute phase after SCI
in randomized and controlled clinical trials.
Besides surgical interventions, pharmacological
treatments to limit the secondary injury after SCI are
often considered. The best-known treatment is a high
dose of the glucocorticosteroid, methylprednisolone
sodium succinate (MPSS) within 8 hours after the in-
jury [12–14,20]. Experimentally it was demonstrat-
ed that a high dose of MPSS reduces the inflammato-
ry response and limit tissue loss after damage to the
spinal cord [78]. The effects of MPSS in patients with
SCI were investigated in 3 consecutive National Acute
Spinal Cord Injury Studies (NASCIS) [12–14]. The
results demonstrated that MPSS treatment in the acute
phase of SCI resulted in neurological improvements up
to 6 months after injury. MPSS is the standard of care
in the United States and other countries. After a thor-
ough review of the results from the NASCIS studies
and a more comprehensive assessment of the benefits
and risks involved in high dose MPSS treatment, the
therapeutic benefits are now disputed [20,62,74,75,86,
100]. Especially in patients with complete SCI high
dose steroid treatment can lead to adverse effects such
as myopathy and wound infection that may negatively
influence functional outcome and in some cases may
be life-threatening [86,100]. Currently, many SCI clin-
ics worldwide have discontinued the ‘standard’ acute
administration of MPSS after SCI. The debate on the
use of MPSS should be accompanied by efforts to de-
velop alternative treatments that counteract the early
destructive events occurring during the acute phase of
SCI.
5.2. Clinical care at later stages after SCI:
Preventing complications
Different complications may occur during the lat-
er stages of SCI (Fig. 3) that each demands specific
actions and/or interventions [61]. For instance, SCI
can lead to pain [103,104], decreased fertility [82], and
autonomic dysreflexia with loss of bladder and bow-
el control [102]. It has to be taken into consideration
that many SCI patients get accustomed to the specif-
ic injury-related pain they experience and as a result
reveal their distress to their physician often at a late
stage [66,92]. For some SCI-related conditions, such
as decreased fertility, it is the patient’s personal desire
that should guide the physician’s actions.
134 R.D.S. Nandoe Tewarie et al. / A clinical perspective of SCI
Fig. 4. Different approaches to directly and/or indirectly influence recovery after SCI.
Other common problems that arise after SCI are
septicemia, respiratory insufficiency, and pneumonia
(Fig. 3). These complications may cause clinical de-
terioration and could eventually result in death. They
often occur without typical symptoms. For example,
pyelonefritis can occur without flank pain or a femur
fracture can occur without pain. This may lead to de-
lay or errors in diagnosis and treatment [28,47]. It is
imperative that SCI patients receive annual screenings
and long-term follow-ups to prevent these secondary
complications. It is advised to treat patients on a reg-
ular basis with pneumococcal and influenza vaccine to
prevent opportunistic infections [55,56]. Monitoring
the skin and urinary tract and implementing aggressive
treatments against pressure ulcers and urinary tract in-
fections is needed to reduce the risk of septicemia [55,
56]. Appropriate nutrition and exercise should also
be incorporated in the (new) lifestyle. Rehabilitation
programs should be implemented to reduce the risk of
cardiovascular disease [97].
Generally, the possible medical complications of
SCI patients are known, mostly recognizable, and their
treatment often straightforward. It is different for the
psychological problems that arise after SCI [10,95]. It
may be possible to recognize some of these but treat-
ment and responses to the treatment are depending
greatly on the individual. One can expect an initial
period of denial and/or inability to fully comprehend
the functional consequences caused by the injury. Next
a period of acceptance will have to run its course [10,
95]. The patient needs to learn to live with the dis-
abilities and this may be accompanied by bouts of de-
pression. The mental state of the patient can have its
effect on medical treatments [103]. The psychologi-
cal consequences of SCI should not be underestimated
and appropriate guidance of patient and family should
have an important place in the late care management of
SCI [10,105].
6. Clinically tested approaches to elicit functional
recovery
Continuing medical care after SCI is necessary to
maintain the patient’s health and quality of life. How-
ever, this generally does not result in dramatic improve-
ments in function that would allow the patient to live
an independent life. Repair-promoting pharmaceuti-
cal and/or surgical interventions will be necessary to
significantly change the functional outcome after SCI
(Fig. 4). Here we will review some of the current treat-
ments that are aimed at limiting functional loss and/or
improving outcome after SCI. In addition we discuss
possible future treatments for spinal cord repair. Ta-
ble 2 provides a list of clinical treatments for SCI.
6.1. Neuroprotective approaches
During the last 30 years, many experimental stud-
ies have targeted neuroprotection (i.e., tissue sparing)
early after SCI to improve outcome. Experimental ev-
idence has shown that the functional loss after SCI can
be limited by implementing neuroprotective approach-
es. The best known neuroprotective approach is acute
administration of MPSS. This has been tested clinical-
ly and is still being used around the world [12–14].
MPSS treatment after SCI was first thought to improve
functional outcome, but at present its true therapeutic
potential is intensely debated [62,74,75,86,100]. The
main goal of MPSS treatment after SCI is to decrease
the aggressive inflammatory response normally present
within the damaged tissue. This would limit the contri-

Fig. 5. Axon regeneration after spinal cord injury. Schematic representation of axon regeneration that could contribute to functional recovery after
SCI. There are 3 types of damages that are inflicted to axons after SCI. Axons may be still in contact with their target neurons but demyelinated
(A) due to immediate or delayed death of oligodendrocytes. These axons can become ‘functional’ and contribute to motor recovery when they
are remyelinated (A’) by either endogenous oligodendrocytes derived from local stem cells or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, or by transplanted
stem/precursor cells or Schwann cells. Axons may be severed and thereby devoid of contact with their target neurons and demyelinated (B). In that
case, the axons need to regenerate across/beyond the injury, establish synaptic contacts with target neurons, and be myelinated by endogenous or
transplanted cells (B’). Unmyelinated axons may be severed and without contact with target neurons (C). These need to regenerate and establish
synaptic connections with the original or new target neurons (C’).
bution of macrophages and activated microglia to the
secondary loss of nervous tissue.
Another example of a molecule that could elicit
neuroprotective effects after SCI is the tetracycline
derivative, minocycline [3–5]. Minocycline may ex-
ert its protective effects through mechanisms that de-
crease injury-induced glutamate-mediated excitotoxic-
ity [3,99] and/or immunomodulatory mechanisms such
as blocking microglial activation [4,32]. Moreover,
minocycline may reduce oligodendrocyte and neuronal
apoptosis as well as dieback of damaged axons [40,96].
These experimentally studies have established minocy-
cline as a promising candidate for early treatment af-
ter SCI. Currently, a phase I/II clinical study is under-
way in the United States to assess the efficacy of intra-
venously administered minocycline in the acute phase
after SCI [6].
6.2. Axon growth-promoting approaches
Functional improvements after SCI could be elicit-
ed by axon growth-promoting approaches as this could
result in either restoration of damaged axonal circuits
or elicit plastic events (Fig. 5) [43,49,90]. Examples of
axon growth- or plasticity-promoting treatments are the
administration of BA-210 or NOGO antibodies. BA-
210 is a Rho antagonist that reduces the levels of in-
tracellular GTPase-associated signaling proteins Rho
and Rac to physiological levels [36,107]. Elevated Rho
has axon growth-inhibitory effects through the above
mentioned pathway [76]. NOGO antibodies neutral-
ize axon growth-inhibitory effects of oligodendrocyte
myelin-bound Nogo [6,23]. Thus, both BA-210 and
NOGO antibodies may result in enhanced axon growth
and/or axon plasticity after SCI. Both treatments are
currently tested clinically for their efficacy to repair the
injured spinal cord [6].
After SCI axons may still be intact but not functional
due to injury-induced conduction block. Administra-
tion of the potassium channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine
(4-AP) may restore such a conduction block and this
could restore axon function and thus contribute to im-
proved function. The efficacy of 4-AP in SCI patients
has been tested clinically but so far the outcome has
been modest [26,34,48].
6.3. Cell transplantation-based approaches
Neuroprotection as well as axonal regeneration could
be achieved by transplanting growth-promoting cellular
or a-cellular substrates. Examples of cellular substrates
that are clinically tested are olfactory ensheathing cells,
peripheral nerves, and activated macrophages. Graft-
ing olfactory ensheathing cells into the spinal cord is
being examined in China, Australia, and Portugal [25,
39,64]. Autologous peripheral nerves are being graft-
ed into the injured spinal cord in Taiwan [24,50] and
activated autologous macrophages in Israel [93] and
Belgium [59]. Thus far, there is no clear evidence that
these transplantation strategies elicit major functional
changes.

7. Frontiers in treatment of SCI
A relatively new concept that does not focus on
anatomical and/or functional repair but rather on sup-
porting the patient to achieve some degree of indepen-
dence is the use of robotics to enable execution of spe-
cific motor tasks. Currently, there are concerted efforts
to employ cerebral (cortical) control for steering robot-
ic devices in combination with micro-chip technologies
that would enable fine-tuning of the robotic movements
depending on the tasks [33,63,83].
Other comparatively novel approaches implement
physical and/or electrical activity to elicit spinal cord
repair. Although these approaches are generally de-
signed to improve muscle strength/use, it has been hy-
pothesized that these particular approaches could also
elicit regenerative cellular events that could contribute
to improved outcome [42,51]. Moreover, locomotor
activity [7,21,89,108] and electrical stimulation [16,
85,91] may promote spinal cord repair via stimulation
of plastic mechanism within existing axon circuits in-
volved in motor function.
A relatively new concept within the more conven-
tional field of cell-based approaches to repair the spinal
cord is the transplantation of stem cells to either re-
place lost cells or elicit regenerative cellular events af-
ter SCI. Stem cells have been studied for their potential
to restore degenerative diseases in the central nervous
system, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple scle-
rosis [60,73,81] or in traumatic injuries such as tran-
sient brain trauma [65,88] or SCI [37,57]. The chal-
lenges are to further develop these concepts to increase
our knowledge and, through experimental research, de-
velop strategies in which they could be benefited from
most.
