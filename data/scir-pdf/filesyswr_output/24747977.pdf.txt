Abstract
Unlike mammals, adult zebrafish are capable of regenerating severed axons and regaining locomotor function after spinal
cord injury. A key factor for this regenerative capacity is the innate ability of neurons to re-express growth-associated genes
and regrow their axons after injury in a permissive environment. By microarray analysis, we have previously shown that the
expression of legumain (also known as asparaginyl endopeptidase) is upregulated after complete transection of the spinal
cord. In situ hybridization showed upregulation of legumain expression in neurons of regenerative nuclei during the phase
of axon regrowth/sprouting after spinal cord injury. Upregulation of Legumain protein expression was confirmed by
immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, upregulation of legumain expression was also observed in macrophages/microglia
and neurons in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site after injury. The role of legumain in locomotor function after spinal
cord injury was tested by reducing Legumain expression by application of anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides. Using
two independent anti-sense morpholinos, locomotor recovery and axonal regrowth were impaired when compared with a
standard control morpholino. We conclude that upregulation of legumain expression after spinal cord injury in the adult
zebrafish is an essential component of the capacity of injured neurons to regrow their axons. Another feature contributing
to functional recovery implicates upregulation of legumain expression in the spinal cord caudal to the injury site. In
conclusion, we established for the first time a function for an unusual protease, the asparaginyl endopeptidase, in the
nervous system. This study is also the first to demonstrate the importance of legumain for repair of an injured adult central
nervous system of a spontaneously regenerating vertebrate and is expected to yield insights into its potential in nervous
system regeneration in mammals.

Introduction
In adult mammals, spinal cord injury (SCI) most often causes
permanent disabilities due to failure to regenerate. In contrast to
mammals, adult zebrafish regenerate successfully after SCI.
Features leading to successful regeneration are the innate ability
of neurons to re-express growth-associated genes, regrow their
axons and adjust their synaptic connections in a permissive CNS
tissue environment [1]. Thus, zebrafish have developed into a
powerful model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
not only spinal cord regeneration, but also regeneration of the
adult CNS in general, raising the hope that the findings from
zebrafish may lead to therapeutic approaches in mammals.
To identify novel regeneration-conducive molecules, we have
performed mRNA microarray expression profiling of the nucleus
of the medial longitudinal fascicle (NMLF), a brainstem nucleus
containing neurons capable of axonal regeneration after injury,
hypothesizing that genes that are upregulated in expression after
SCI contribute to successful recovery of locomotor functions. One
of the molecules upregulated in neurons capable of axonal
regeneration after SCI was legumain [2], the function of which
in regeneration and in nervous system functions in general, is
unknown.
Since proteases play important roles in all aspects of nervous
system development, tissue remodeling during learning/memory
and after injury [3–4], we chose to investigate the unusual
proteolytic enzyme legumain among the upregulated molecules.
As a member of the C13 family of cysteine proteases, legumain/
asparaginyl endopeptidase cleaves protein substrates at the C-
terminus of asparagine [5]. Legumain was first observed to be
located in the endosome/lysosome systems [6], has since been
detected in the nucleus [7–8], at the cell surface [9] and in the
extracellular matrix [10–13]. Legumain is involved in many
physiological and pathological processes, such as antigen process-
ing [14], cell migration [9] and proliferation [7], regulation of
biosynthesis of lysosomal proteins [15], extracellular matrix
turnover [12], as well as osteoclast formation and bone resorption
[10]. Upregulation of legumain expression has been reported in
various solid tumors, positively correlating with their invasive and

metastatic potential [9,16–17]. Legumain also functions as a
carboxypeptidase [18].
The role of legumain in nervous system function has yet to be
determined, particularly in recovery after injury. Here we report a
novel function of legumain in the nervous system, and in particular
in regeneration of the adult zebrafish CNS. Legumain expression
is upregulated after SCI not only in regenerative brainstem
neurons, but also in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site.
Inhibition of this expression reduces locomotor recovery, thus
identifying legumain as a novel protease that is an important
contributor to functional recovery after injury in the adult
zebrafish CNS.
Materials and Methods
Spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish
Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio, male, age.6 months) were obtained
from Aquatica Tropicals Inc. (Plant City, FL, USA). The fish were
maintained at 28uC on a 14-h light and 10-h dark cycle. SCI was
performed as described [2,19–23]. Briefly, fish were put in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 0.033%
aminobenzoic acid ethylmethylester (MS222; Sigma, St Louis,
MO, USA) for 5 min. To expose the vertebral column, a
longitudinal incision at the left side of the fish was made. Then,
a complete cut of the spinal cord was performed between the
eighth and ninth vertebrae, 3.5 mm caudal to the brainstem-spinal
cord junction. The sham-injured control fish (CON) received
similar surgical procedures without cutting the spinal cord. The
incision was sealed with Histoacryl (B. Braun, Melsungen,
Germany) and fish were returned to their rearing tank. Fish were
killed by an overdose of MS222 at the appropriate time points. All
animal experiments were approved by the Rutgers University
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (permit number:
10010), which conforms to NIH guidelines.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and
microarray data
Four millimeters of whole spinal cord tissue caudal to the lesion
site was collected at 1 day, 3 days, and 11 days after surgery from
SCI or sham-injured fish. Spinal cords from 6 fish were pooled for
each group. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy
Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and a total of 200 ng RNA
was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using SuperscriptTM II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time poly-
merase chain reaction (qPCR) was carried out with Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) and the comparative cycle threshold Ct method (DDCt
method) was applied for data analysis as described [24]. No
amplified product was observed when the cDNA template was
replaced either by RNA sample without reverse transcription or by
water. Results are expressed relative to sham-injured fish 1 day
after SCI. The primers used were as follows: zebrafish legumain
(forward: 59-GGCGTTCCAGGGTAGCTCTA-39; reverse: 59-
GACACTGGCTCCACTGCCTT-39) and zebrafish ribosomal
protein P0 (forward: 59-TCGGCTACCCAACTCTTGCT-39;
reverse: 59-TGTTTCGACAGTGACAGCCAG-39).
Microarray analysis was performed and analyzed as described
[2]. Please refer to previous publication for detailed information
[2]. Data files for this microarray analysis have been deposited in
the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus repository. The accession
number is GSE28470 and the link is https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc =GSE28470.
In situ hybridization
PCR product for zebrafish legumain (NM_214759, 628–1043 bp
of coding sequence) was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, with
which digoxigenin-labeled RNA sense and antisense probes were
transcribed in vitro using the MegascriptTM system (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In
situ hybridization was carried out as described [2,25–26]. Briefly,
25-mm-thick coronal brain sections or 20-mm-thick sagittal spinal
cord sections were incubated with 0.1 N HCl for 10 min. After
three washes in PBS, pH 7.4, the sections were treated with
10 mg/mL proteinase-K (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for
10 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were hybridized
with sense or antisense probes at 55uC overnight. Alkaline
phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche) was used
to label the hybridized probes and the signal was developed with
NBT/BCIP (nitro-blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-
indolyl phosphate, Roche). The same procedure was used for
sections from fish that were not injured, sham-injured or spinal
cord-injured. In situ hybridization with the sense control probe
and the antisense probe was performed in parallel. No significant
signal was observed for the sense probe. The NMLF (medial
longitudinal fascicle) and IMRF (intermediate reticular formation)
can be located according to the atlas of zebrafish brain [27] and
the neurons with large cell body size (13–23 mm diameter) [20] are
distinguishable from small glial cells [25]. Total positively stained
neurons in the NMLF or the IMRF from each fish were counted.
For profile measurements of spinal cord sections, cells in fifteen
106 fields, 5 from each animal, were counted. The intensity of
each cell, in a total of 60 cells for each treatment, was measured
using ImageJ.
Immunohistochemistry and double staining for in situ
hybridization and immunohistochemistry
Sections from brain (25-mm-thick coronal) or spinal cord (20-
mm-thick, sagittal, 0–4 mm caudal to lesion site) were blocked with
1% bovine serum albumin and 3% donkey serum in PBS
containing 0.2% Triton-X-100 for 1 hour at room temperature,
followed by primary antibody incubation. Primary antibodies used
were: goat anti-human legumain (AF2199, 1:200, R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) (1:500, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), mouse anti-NeuN
(1:150, A-60, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and mouse 4C4
antibody (92092321, 7.4.C4, 1:60, Health Protection Agency
Culture Collection). Legumain protein contains 433 amino acids,
and the legumain antibody used here was raised against the
human Legumain sequence of amino acids 18–433. The identity
of these amino acids between human and zebrafish is 67%. The
specificity of the legumain antibody in recognizing zebrafish
Legumain was verified by Western blot analysis (Figure S1). Alexa
Fluor secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at a
dilution of 1:600. Non-immune mouse or goat IgGs were used in
place of primary antibodies at the same concentrations as isotype
controls.
The immunohistochemical detection of the expression of NeuN
(neuronal marker neuronal nuclei) in legumain mRNA positive cells
(in situ hybridization) was carried out after completion of in situ
hybridization. After three washes in PBS, the sections were treated
with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95uC for 15 min for antigen
retrieval as described [2,28]. After cool down to room tempera-
ture, the sections were washed three times with PBS and blocked
with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% goat
serum. Then, the sections were incubated with mouse anti-NeuN

antibody at 4uC overnight, followed by incubation with secondary
antibody Alexa Fluor 555 (1:600, Invitrogen).
Application of morpholinos and biocytin
Two non-overlapping antisense morpholinos (MOs) for zebra-
fish legumain (NM_214759) (legumain MO1: 59-
GGCTCATTTCTGCAATTTACAGCTA -39; legumain MO2:
59-GTACACGACGCCCGAGCTGCCTGTA -39, Gene Tools,
LLC, Philomath, OR, USA) were used in this study. Both legumain
MOs, tagged with carboxyfluorescein at the 39 end, were designed
to block translation. The specificity and efficacy of these two
legumain MOs to knockdown Legumain expression was demon-
strated by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against
Legumain. The standard control MO (59- CCTCTTACCT-
CAGTTACAATTTATA-39) was also tagged with carboxyfluor-
escein at the 39 end. MOs were prepared in Danieau solution
(58 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM KCl, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 0.6 mM
Ca(NO3)2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, as described [2,19,21–23].
Five hundred nanograms MO (approximately 0.2 mL, carried
by Gelfoam (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI, USA)) was applied at the
lesion site immediately after transection. Then, the fish were
allowed to survive up to 6 weeks. The efficiency of this MO dose
(500 ng per fish) was shown in our publication [19] and was
confirmed thereafter [2,21–23,29–31]. In order to detect the
neurons with regenerated axons, at 6 weeks after the MO
treatment, biocytin (Sigma) (50 mg/mL, approximately 0.2 mL,
absorbed in Gelfoam) was applied to a secondary lesion site, which
was 3.5 mm caudal to the first spinal lesion site for MO treatment,
i.e. 7 mm caudal to the brainstem–spinal cord junction. One day
afterwards, the brains were dissected and biocytin was detected
with the Vectastain ABC-DAB kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlin-
game, CA, USA) as described [2,19,22]. For cell body profile
counting, all positively stained neurons in the NMLF and IMRF of
each animal were counted.
Locomotor analysis
To examine locomotor recovery, the total distance swum by the
MO-treated fish was measured at 6 weeks after MO treatment.
Freely moving fish was tracked as described [2,19,21–23]. Briefly,
each fish was placed in a glass tank (50630 cm) containing
aquarium water (5 cm deep). The moving of the fish was recorded
for 5 min by a camera mounted above the tank. Ethovision XT
software (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands) was used to
track and calculate swim paths.
Statistical analysis
A two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the results
from microarray analysis of legumain mRNA expression in spinal
cord, legumain-positive neuronal profiles in different regenerative
nuclei after SCI, legumain immunostaining intensity in small cells,
and numbers of legumain-immunopositive small cells after SCI.
One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, when
appropriate, was used for analysis of Legumain protein expression
profiles after MO treatment, locomotor recovery after MO
application, evaluation of fluorescein-positive cell profiles after
MO application and of neuronal profiles retrogradely labeled after
MO application in two nuclei with innate capacity for regener-
ation. Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, when
appropriate, was used for evaluation of the qPCR results of
legumain expression in the caudal part of the spinal cord. The level
of significance was set at P,0.05 for all analyses. Data are shown
as mean values 6SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using
R2.12.2 software (http://www.r-project.org).
Results
Legumain expression is upregulated in the nucleus of the
medial longitudinal fascicle after SCI
To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying
successful spinal cord regeneration after SCI in adult zebrafish, we
had performed microarray analysis to detect gene expression
profile changes after SCI, when compared to sham-injured fish
[2]. For the microarray analysis, RNA samples were prepared
from tissue microdissected from the anatomically well defined
NMLF nucleus. This analysis showed that legumain mRNA
expression does not change during early phases after axotomy,
i.e. 4 h (1.03860.067 (SCI) versus 1.00060.118 (CON), two-tailed
t-test, P.0.05) and 12 h (0.95460.120 (SCI) versus 1.00060.089
(CON), two-tailed t-test, P.0.05) when compared to sham-injured
fish, which were generally taken as controls. However, a significant
upregulation of legumain mRNA expression was observed at 11
days (1.74560.171 (SCI) versus 1.00060.089 (CON), two-tailed t-
test, P,0.05), a time point when tissue remodeling begins to lead
to locomotor improvement. The expression of legumain mRNA in
individual neurons in the NMLF and intermediate reticular
formation (IMRF), another nucleus capable of innate regenerating
lesioned axons, was studied by in situ hybridization. With the sense
probe, no significant signal was observed when staining was
performed in parallel using the antisense probe (Fig. 1A). Positive
signal for legumain mRNA was observed in the NMLF neurons,
which can easily be identified by their location and large cell body
size (.13 mm in diameter) (Figs. 1A, 2A). The neuronal cell
identity of these cells expressing legumain mRNA in the NMLF and
IMRF was further validated by double labeling of legumain mRNA
(in situ hybridization) and the neuronal marker NeuN (immuno-
histochemistry) (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our microarray analysis,
the number of legumain-positive neuronal profiles was considerably
increased in the NMLF at 11 days after SCI (Fig.1A, B). In the
IMRF, upregulation of legumain mRNA expression was identified
by increased numbers of positive neurons 11 days after SCI (Fig.
1A, C). Upregulation of legumain mRNA in these regenerative
nuclei after SCI suggests that legumain contributes to successful
regeneration.
In addition to investigating the nuclei with neurons capable of
axonal regrowth, expression of legumain mRNA was also examined
in neurons with no or limited capacity for innate regeneration,
such as Mauthner neurons [20]. Unlike the findings in the NMLF
or IMRF, no significant signal was observed in Mauthner neurons
in sections from fish with or without SCI (data not shown). This
indicates that upregulation of legumain mRNA is characteristic of
neurons with regenerative capacity.
Microarray analysis showed no change for legumain mRNA
expression at 4 h and 12 h after SCI in the NMLF. At 1 day after
SCI, no change in legumain expression was observed in the NMLF
(Fig. 1B) or IMRF (Fig. 1C). However, a slight but significant
increase in legumain mRNA levels was observed at 3 days after SCI
in both the NMLF (Fig. 1B) and IMRF (Fig. 1C), suggesting that
upregulation of legumain expression as measured by in situ
hybridization occurs at an early time point, but not immediately
after axotomy. Upregulation of Legumain expression in the
NMLF and IMRF was also seen at the protein level by
immunohistochemistry using an antibody against human Legu-
main, which detects zebrafish Legumain (Fig. 2B). This upregula-
tion of legumain expression by regenerative supraspinal neurons
during axon regrowth/sprouting suggests that legumain contrib-
utes to regeneration after injury.
Legumain Promotes Spinal Cord Regeneration in Zebrafish

Legumain expression is upregulated in the caudal spinal
cord after SCI
In addition to brainstem neurons which are capable to regrow
their axons after SCI, the caudal part spinal cord is another key
factor for successful regeneration [19,21,29–33]. It is hypothesized
that the caudal spinal cord, into which regenerating axons project,
should be permissive for axonal regeneration, and that the cellular
rearrangements in the caudal spinal cord also contribute
essentially to regeneration. Levels of legumain mRNA in the caudal
spinal cord were studied by qPCR at 1 day, 3 days and 11 days
after SCI, in parallel with cells from the brainstem. Levels of
legumain mRNA in the caudal spinal cord were not changed 1 day
after SCI (Fig. 3A), but considerably increased at 3 days (Fig. 3A).
Upregulation was also seen at 11 days after SCI (Fig. 3A), although
less so than at 3 days after SCI.
To investigate the expression pattern of legumain in the caudal
part of the injured spinal cord, in situ hybridization was performed.
Two regions of the spinal cord were investigated: the tissue
immediately caudal to the lesion site (approximately 50–80 mm in
length) (Fig. 3B) and the remaining caudal spinal cord tissue (Fig.
3B). The reason for this analysis was that the two regions showed
different legumain expression patterns by in situ hybridization after
SCI. In the sham-injured control group, the two spinal cord
regions showed a similar expression pattern of legumain (Fig. 3B).
Figure 1. Legumain mRNA expression is upregulated in brainstem neurons during the axonal regrowth phase after SCI. (A) In situ
hybridization was performed to study the expression of legumain in the NMLF and IMRF. Representative images depict legumain-positive cells in the
NMLF and IMRF 11 days after SCI. More positive cells for legumain mRNA are observed in the NMLF and IMRF after SCI when compared with sham-
injured control. With the sense control probe, no signal is observed. (B, C) Quantification shows that legumain mRNA expression is slightly
upregulated in the NMLF and IMRF at 3 days and highly upregulated at 11 days after SCI. The expression patterns of legumain in the NMLF and IMRF
are similar. Dorsal is up. NMLF, n=6 fish; IMRF, n= 3 fish. * P,0.05, two-tailed t-test; mean values 6SEM are shown. Scale bar, 50 mm.

Legumain Promotes Spinal Cord Regeneration in Zebrafish
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95098
In the non-injured spinal cord, in situ hybridization signals were
mainly observed in a few neurons with large round cell bodies (.
13 mm in diameter) in the gray matter. These cells were identified
as neurons by double immunolabeling with the neuronal marker
NeuN (see below). When compared to non-injured fish, positive
signals in the 1 day sham-injured control spinal cord was also seen
in many small cells with irregular shapes (identified as macro-
phages/microglia by double immunolabeling with 4C4 antibody,
see below) localized in both gray and white matter along the entire
length of the caudal spinal cord, indicating that sham-injury
induces legumain expression. In comparison to the sham-injured
group, more intense signals in these small cells were observed in
the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site after SCI (Fig. 3B, 1d-
CON, 10068.55%; 1d-SCI, 186.1166.24 (normalized to 1d-
CON), n=3 fish, two-tailed t-test, P=0.001). No difference in the
numbers of these small cells was found between the sham-injured
and SCI groups (data not shown), indicating that the increased
expression of legumain 1 day after SCI is due to increased
expression intensity by the small cells. At the lesion site, at 1 day, 3
days and 11 days after SCI, many intensely legumain positive small
cells were observed (Fig. 3B).
Interestingly, the in situ hybridization signal for legumain in the
small cells in 3 days sham-injured control group was no longer
detectable, and a positive signal was only seen in neurons as seen
in the non-injured spinal cord. However, many small cells with
strong signal for legumain were observed at 3 days after SCI.
Furthermore, when compared to the signal at 1 day after SCI,
more small cells were found in the spinal cord caudal to the injury
site at 3 days after SCI (Fig. 3B, 1d-SCI, 10065.02%; 3d-SCI,
149.42612.03% (normalized to 1d-SCI), n=3 fish, two-tailed t-
test, P=0.02), also with a more staining intense signal (Fig. 3B, 1d-
SCI, 10063.354%; 3d-SCI, 124.7161.16% (normalized to 1d-
SCI), n=3 fish, two-tailed t-test, P=0.002). Similar to the findings
at 1 day after SCI, no significant differences of legumain expression
in neurons were found between the sham-injured and SCI groups
at 3 days. Thus, increased expression of legumain at 3 days after
SCI is due to both the increased number of positive cells and
expression intensity of legumain in the small cells compared to 1 day
after SCI.
The expression pattern of legumain in the sham-injured group at
11 days was similar to that of the 3 day sham-injured group, i.e.
only neurons with a large cell body (.13 mm in diameter) express
Figure 2. Upregulation of legumain expression in brainstem neurons at 11 days after SCI. (A) Double staining of legumain mRNA (in situ
hybridization) and NeuN (immunohistochemistry) was performed to determine the identity of legumain-positive cells. The signal for NeuN locates in
the nucleus and legumain mRNA locates in the neuronal cytoplasm in the NMLF and IMRF. (B) Immunohistochemistry for Legumain shows more

legumain under these conditions. Interestingly, at 11 days after SCI,
legumain in the small cells in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site
was no longer detectable, while more neurons showed upregula-
tion of legumain expression after SCI when compared to the sham-
injured control group (Fig. 3B, 11d-CON, 10065.25%; 11d-SCI,
261.44615.26% (normalized to 11d-CON), n=3 fish, two-tailed t-
test, P=0.0006).
The combined observations indicate that upregulation of
legumain expression in the caudal spinal cord is due to its expression
by small cells in the lesion site at all time points tested. At 1 day
and 3 days after SCI, upregulation of legumain is also due to
increased expression by small cells in the spinal cord caudal to the
lesion site. At 11 days after SCI, neurons contribute to this
upregulation.
Identification of legumain positive cells in the spinal cord
Cells expressing legumain in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion
site were identified by immunohistochemistry using NeuN as a
marker for neurons and GFAP for astrocytes. Macrophages/
microglia were identified by antibody 4C4 [34–35]. Since highest
expression of legumain by small cells was observed 3 days after SCI
(Fig. 3B), double immunostaining of GFAP and 4C4 with
Legumain was performed in sections taken from spinal cord
caudal to the lesion site 3 days after SCI. Similarly, double
immunostaining of NeuN with Legumain was performed using
sections from fish 11 days after SCI, showing colocalization of
NeuN with Legumain (Fig. 4 I–L). No colocalization GFAP and
Legumain was observed (Fig. 4 A–D). In the non-injured spinal
Figure 3. Legumain mRNA expression is upregulated in the caudal spinal cord after SCI. (A) Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) shows that
legumain mRNA expression increases from 3 days post-injury and remains upregulated at 11 days after SCI. (B) In situ hybridization for legumain
mRNA in the caudal spinal cord shows different expression patterns in the lesion site (area with stripes) and the caudal part of spinal cord (area with
dots). In the non-injured spinal cord, legumain mRNA is only observed in neurons. In the lesion site, legumainmRNA is observed in many small cells at
all time points tested after SCI. In the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site, legumainmRNA is detectable in small cells in both the sham-injured and SCI
groups at 1 day, with a stronger signal for legumain mRNA after SCI compared to the sham injury group. At 3 days, while the signal for legumain
mRNA in small cells is not detectable anymore in the sham-injured group, strong positive signal for legumain mRNA expression is observed in small
cells in the SCI group. At 11 days, more positive neurons are seen after SCI compared to the sham-injury group. No signal is detectable with the sense
probe. Rostral is left and caudal is right. A, n= 3 experiments; B, n= 4 fish for each group. * P,0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test; mean

cord, only very few cells were positive for 4C4, which are negative
for Legumain. Three days after SCI, almost all 4C4 positive cells
expressed Legumain in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site
(Fig. 4 E–H). In the lesion site, Legumain expressing cells were also
positive for 4C4 (data not shown). Interestingly, at 11 days after
SCI, 4C4 immunopositive macrophages/microglia did not express
detectable levels of Legumain (data not shown), demonstrating
down-regulated expression of legumain in macrophages/microglia
to basal levels as seen in the non-injured spinal cord. These
observations suggest that expression of legumain in macrophages/
microglia is limited to their early activation stages.
Legumain is essential for spinal cord regeneration in
adult zebrafish
As legumain expression is upregulated after SCI, we used anti-
sense morpholinos (MOs) to knockdown expression of Legumain
to investigate whether this molecule is essential in spinal cord
regeneration. Two different MOs used here were labeled with
fluorescein, allowing identification of the cells that had taken up
the MOs. To validate the knockdown of Legumain at the protein
level, immunohistochemistry was performed on brainstem sections
from animals treated with standard control and legumain MOs 11
days after SCI. As shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 5, expression of
Legumain in NMLF neurons was strongly increased after SCI.
Application of legumain MO1 or MO2 (Fig. 5 A, B) dramatically
reduced the numbers of Legumain protein expressing neurons in
the NMLF compared to standard control MO treatment (Fig. 5 A,
B). In the legumain anti-sense MO treated groups, neurons positive
for fluorescein were not positive for Legumain by immunohisto-
chemistry, while in the control MO treated group, neurons
positive for MO also were positive for Legumain.
The locomotor recovery after complete spinal cord transection
in adult zebrafish is measured by their free swimming ability at 6
weeks after SCI. The ability of injured fish to swim reaches
maximal levels at 6 weeks after SCI with no additional
improvement 10 weeks after SCI [19]. Locomotor recovery was
quantified in terms of total distance moved by undisturbed fish
during 5 min at 6 weeks after SCI. Fish treated with legumain MO1
or MO2 showed impaired recovery compared to fish treated with
standard control MO: the total distances moved by fish treated
with legumain MO1 (Fig. 5C) or legumain MO2 (Fig. 5C) were highly
reduced relative to standard control MO treated fish, indicating
that legumain contributes to functional recovery.
To investigate the effect of legumain MOs on axonal regrowth
after SCI, retrograde tracing of brainstem neurons was performed
Figure 4. Neurons and macrophages/microglia express Legumain in the caudal spinal cord after SCI. Spinal cord sections from fish 3
days after SCI were used for double staining of Legumain and GFAP (A–D) or 4C4 (E–H). Spinal cord sections from fish 11 days after SCI were used for
double staining of Legumain and NeuN (I–L). B, F, and J are the magnifications of A, E and I, respectively. No co-localization of Legumain and GFAP is
observed (A–D). Double immunostaining of Legumain with 4C4 antibody identifies the positive small cells as macrophages/microglia (E–H). Double
staining with NeuN shows that neurons express Legumain at 11 days after SCI (I–L). n= 3 experiments. Scale bar, 50 mm.

after analysis of locomotor recovery of the fish. The tracer,
biocytin, was applied 3.5 mm caudal to the first lesion site. Fish
treated with legumain anti-sense MOs showed reduced numbers of
biocytin labeled neurons compared to control MO treated fish.
The numbers of retrogradely labeled neurons were reduced in
legumain anti-sense MO1 or MO2 treated fish in comparison to
control MO treated fish in the NMLF or the IMRF (Fig. 6A, B).
Since the legumain MOs were tagged with fluorescein, we were able
to detect their presence 6 weeks after application as reported
[2,19]. As the standard control MO does not affect cell viability
[19], we compared the numbers of fluorescein-positive cell profiles
from legumain MO1 or MO2-treated fish with those from control
MO-treated fish. No difference was found in the numbers of
fluorescein-positive cells in the NMLF between control and
experimental animals (data not shown), indicating that neurons
are not affected in their survival by MO treatment. Altogether,
observations showed reduced locomotor recovery and reduced
numbers of retrogradely labeled NMLF neurons in animals treated
with legumain MOs, indicating that legumain contributes to
locomotor recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI in adult
zebrafish.
Discussion
In this study, we have identified legumain as an essential
component for successful spinal cord regeneration after complete

spinal cord transection in adult zebrafish. We found that legumain
is one of the upregulated genes in the NMLF during axon
regeneration by microarray analysis, in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry. Moreover, levels of legumain mRNA are
also increased in the caudal part spinal cord, which provides a
permissive environment for regeneration. This upregulation of
legumain expression has a biological function, since knockdown of
Legumain expression strongly impaired locomotor recovery and
axonal regrowth of brainstem neurons.
Microarray analysis had shown that there is no change of
legumain mRNA expression during the early injury response period,
i.e. 4 and 12 hours, suggesting that legumain is not involved in
early responses after injury in neurons capable of axonal
regeneration. At 3 days after SCI, upregulation of legumain
expression becomes detectable and is very prominent at 11 days
after SCI (Fig. 7), a time point of active axonal regrowth. Similar
to our present results, upregulation of legumain expression occurs
also at later phases after injury in retinal ganglion cells [36], optic
nerve [37] and heart [38], suggesting that different organs use
similar molecular mechanisms in regeneration. Similarly, upregu-
lation of legumain is observed not only in the NMLF neurons, but
also the IMRF neurons, indicating similar molecular mechanisms
in neurons capable of axonal regrowth. Mauthner cells with no or
limited capacity for regeneration, do not express legumain neither in
sham-injured nor spinal cord injured fish at any time point after
SCI, suggesting that upregulation of legumain expression is
specifically associated with neurons capable of axonal regrowth.
In addition to the upregulation of legumain in brainstem neurons
capable of axonal regeneration after SCI, cells in the spinal cord
caudal to the lesion site also express higher levels of legumain after
injury at all time points tested, with increased legumain expression
reaching the highest level at 3 days after SCI. At 1 day and 3 days
after SCI (Fig. 7), legumain expression is distinctly upregulated in
macrophages/microglia, not only in the lesion site, but also caudal
to the lesion site. Interestingly, however, legumain expression in
macrophages/microglia is no more detectable at 11 days after SCI
when neurons in spinal cord upregulate legumain expression (Fig.
7). Surprisingly, macrophages/microglia cells also express legumain
in 1 day sham-injured control fish, in contrast to absence of
legumain expression in these cells in non-injured fish. Of note,
legumain expression in macrophages/microglia in sham-injured
spinal cord is no more detectable at 3 days (Fig. 7), which differs
from conditions of SCI under which legumain expression is
upregulated at this time point. Insights into the molecular
mechanisms underlying the transient expression after sham-injury
are difficult to explain at present, but it is conceivable that de-
afferentation of muscle innervation induced by cutting muscles at
the thoracic level could activate macrophages/microglia. It should

be emphasized that this transient legumain expression after sham-
injury is weak in comparison to the reaction after SCI, but shows
the sensitivity of macrophages/microglia to relatively mild
interventions with physiological homeostasis. Similarly, legumain
is detectable in mammalian macrophages [39–43] where its
lysosomal proteolytic activity contributes to protein degradation
and antigen presentation. However, the detailed molecular
mechanisms of legumain’s functions in macrophages/microglia
have remained unclear. To the best of our knowledge, our study is
the first to show that legumain expression is limited to a specifically
transient stage of macrophages/microglia activation after tissue
injury. Thus, legumain may become a useful early activation
marker for macrophages/microglia.
The expression of legumain in macrophages/microglia raises
the question as to the involvement of the immune system in
zebrafish regeneration. In a recent study, acute inflammation
initiates the regenerative response and is required for successful
regeneration in the acutely injured adult zebrafish brain [44].
Similarly, application of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid signif-
icantly reduces heart regenerative capacities in adult zebrafish
[45]. Expression of legumain in macrophages/microglia in the
early responses to injury in the spinal cord suggests that legumain
expression might be supportive to recovery from trauma in
zebrafish. Similarly, we found increased legumain expression at
the lesion site of the mouse spinal cord at 7 days after SCI and this
increase is attributable to accumulation of macrophages/microglia
(unpublished observation). However, we did not observe upregula-
tion of legumain in spinal motor neurons as we did in the
zebrafish. In future experiments, we will test if increased
expression of legumain in spinal cord and projection neurons
can positively affect axon outgrowth after SCI in mammals.
After its discovery as a robust acidic cysteine endopeptidase, a
considerable number of target proteins for legumain were
described, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) component
fibronectin [12]. The expression and functions of legumain in
solid tumors has also been explored. In contrast to its low
expression level in most normal tissues [9,46], legumain is highly
expressed in many solid tumors, being related to a more invasive
and metastatic phenotype [9,16–17,47]. Tumor invasion and
metastasis is a complex process involving interactions between the
invasive cells and the ECM, where proteases are essential for
tumor cell-mediated ECM proteolysis. Notably, legumain is
present extracellularly in the tumor microenviroment and
associated with matrix as well as cell surfaces [9,11,48]. The
Figure 7. Summary scheme of legumain expression patterns in distinct cell types in brain and spinal cord after SCI. No signal for
legumain expression was set as 0. When signal for legumain is detected in sham-injured control at 1 day post-injury, the value for legumain expression
in 1 day sham-injured control is set as 1 and the relative expression in all other groups is normalized to the 1 day sham-injured control. The
expression of legumain in brainstem neurons (NMLF-I, IMRF-I) is increased sharply after 1 day post-SCI. Legumain in spinal cord neurons (SC-N-I) is
increased only at 11 days post-SCI. In the sham-injured control group, legumain expression in macrophages/microglia in the caudal spinal cord (SC-M-
C) is detectable at 1 day and no more detectable thereafter. In the SCI group (SC-M-I), legumain expression in macrophages/microglia is increased 1
day, reaches a peak at 3 days and disappears 11 days after SCI. Abbreviations: Mauthner-I, Mauthner neurons of the SCI group; NMLF-C, NMLF

association of secreted legumain with the extracellular matrix has
been repeatedly described [10–13,16,49], an observation which
has instigated the design legumain-activated anti-cancer prodrugs
[13]. Furthermore, legumain is able to activate the secreted
inactive proenzyme of matrix metalloproteinase-2 [9,50], the role
of which in tumor cell-mediated ECM proteolysis and metastasis
has been well established [51]. Similar to mechanisms in tumor
metastasis, growth cones of regenerating axons degrade ECM
molecules for motility and neurite extension, pointing to share
similar mechanisms in proteolysis [52]. The extracellular activity
of legumain is indicated in our study, where we could show that
legumain is secreted by legumain positive cell types, such as
microglia/macrophages and neurons (Figure S2). It is also possible
that the upregulation of legumain in the caudal spinal cord after
SCI may play a role in remodeling the extracellular environment
to facilitate axon regeneration into the caudal spinal cord. It is
noteworthy in this context that legumain is optimally active under
acidic conditions, which are acutely generated in the spinal cord
after injury and which are present in the microenvironment of
tumors. Unfortunately, the investigation of the mechanisms
underlying the functions of legumain with different cell types in
vitro is hampered by the fact that cultured cells cannot be
maintained under acidic conditions for time periods necessary for
functional studies, thereby preventing the establishment of
conditions that mirror those in vivo after injury.
It is noteworthy that some functions of legumain do not require
its enzyme activity. The expression of legumain in the nucleus is
regulated by nuclear calcium concentration and nuclear legumain
is involved in cell proliferation, independent on its enzyme activity
[7]. Also legumain’s presence in human bone marrow is reported
to inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption without its
enzymatic activity [10]. Moreover, identification of legumain as a
carboxypeptidase may allow novel insights into the functions of
legumain under different physiological conditions [18]. In future
experiments, we plan to examine the mechanism through which
legumain appears to enhance recovery from CNS injury in
zebrafish. Discovery of other target proteins for legumain and
further biochemical studies may be helpful in elucidating
mechanistic features of legumain function to develop potential
therapies to promote CNS repair in mammals.
