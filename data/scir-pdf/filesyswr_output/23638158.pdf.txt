Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a permanent disability in patients. To this day no curative treatment can be proposed to
restore lost functions. Therefore, extensive experimental studies have been conducted to induce recovery after SCI. One of
the most promising therapies is based on the use of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). OECs can be obtained from either
the olfactory bulbs (OB-OECs) or from olfactory mucosa (OM-OECs), involving a less invasive approach for
autotransplantation. However the vast majority of experimental transplantations have been focusing on OB-OECs although
the OM represents a more accessible source of OECs. Importantly, the ability of OM-OECs in comparison to OB-OECs to
induce spinal cord recovery in the same lesion paradigm has never been described. We here present data using a
multiparametric approach, based on electrophysiological, behavioral, histological and magnetic resonance imaging
experiments on the repair potential of OB-OECs and OM-OECs from either primary or purified cultures after a severe model
of SCI. Our data demonstrate that transplantation of OECs obtained from OB or OM induces electrophysiological and
functional recovery, reduces astrocyte reactivity and glial scar formation and improves axonal regrowth. We also show that
the purification step is essential for OM-OECs while not required for OB-OECs. Altogether, our study strongly indicates that
transplantation of OECs from OM represents the best benefit/risk ratio according to the safety of access of OM and the
results induced by transplantations of OM-OECs. Indeed, purified OM-OECs in addition to induce recovery can integrate and
survive up to 60 days into the spinal cord. Therefore, our results provide strong support for these cells as a viable therapy for
SCI.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease leading to a
loss of neural conduction. Sensory and motor pathways are
interrupted resulting to paraplegia or tetraplegia for patients.
After SCI several mechanisms take place such as astrocyte
reactivity, formation of the glial scar, invasion of inflammatory
cells resulting in a lack of axonal regrowth [1,2]. To this day no
curative treatment is available for clinical use. Therefore
extensive experimental studies have been conducted to increase
axonal regrowth and to promote functional recovery after SCI
using various therapies [3,4]. Many of these approaches have
used cellular transplantation, such as Schwann cells (SC), neural
stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells or olfactory ensheath-
ing cells (OECs, ‘‘OECs’’ is used to name all the olfactory
ensheathing cells) with contrasting results [5–12]. OECs have
gained considerable interest for the past decade due to the fact
that OECs have shown a great potential to restore both
functional and anatomical recoveries after SCI [13]. OECs are
neural crest cells which participate to neurogenesis occurring in
the primary olfactory system throughout life in mammals [14].
Following transplantation in lesioned spinal cord, OECs were
shown to enhance axonal regrowth, regulate astrocyte reactivity,
increase angiogenesis and modulate glial scar leading to
functional recovery in various models of SCI in rodents [15–
19]. However, OECs are constituted of several subpopulations
and the role of each of them following transplantation in
injured spinal cord is not well described [20,21]. Specifically,
OECs can be obtained from two different regions: olfactory
mucosa (OM) and olfactory bulbs (OB) and it appears that
OECs obtained from OM (OM-OECs) and OB (OB-OECs)
have not the same properties and effects after transplantation
in vivo [22,23]. Moreover, culture conditions, in particular the
presence of microenvironment, can greatly influence OECs
behaviors in vitro and in vivo [21,24]. OM-OECs are closely
associated with primary olfactory neurons and fibroblasts,
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62860
whereas OB -OECs are in contact with fibroblasts and
astrocytes both in vitro and in vivo [25–28]. For a clinical
purpose these two aspects have some relevant consequences.
Indeed, for clinical use, OECs could be obtained for autotrans-
plantation easily by a simple biopsy of OM or more invasively,
as described by Rubio et al., after an unilateral bulbectomy
from OB [29]. Furthermore, OECs can be transplanted either
as primary cultures or after additional purification steps and it is
well described that time in culture can alter neurogenic
properties of OECs [30,31].
Here we have directly compared the potential of OECs
obtained and purified from the two sources in a severe model of
SCI by a multiparametric approach. We demonstrate that
transplantation of OECs induces electrophysiological and func-
tional recovery, reduces astrocyte reactivity and glial scar
formation and improves axonal regrowth. Moreover, in our
model, transplantation of OECs from OM represents the best
benefit/risk source, providing support for these cells as a new
therapy for SCI in human.
Materials and Methods
General Overview
An overview of the paradigms used in this study is presented in
Figure 1.
Briefly, cellular transplantations were performed after complete
transection of the spinal cord from two sources (OB and OM) and
cultured in two different ways (primary and purified). For OB
(Primary OB) and OM (Primary OM), primary cultures were
transplanted after 5 days in vitro (DIV). For OB (Purified OB),
purified cultures were transplanted after 10 DIV. For OM
(Purified OM), purified cultures were transplanted after 14 DIV.
All different cell types were transplanted immediately after spinal
cord transection. All groups of animals were analyzed 15, 30 and
60 days after surgery for electrophysiological and locomotor
activities. Histological analyses were performed blindly 60 days
after transplantation for all the groups. Then, additional animals
treated with Md, Primary OB and Purified OM, which showed
higher potential to promote recovery, were used for MRI analyses
7 days after transplantation. Finally, OM purified cells, which
constituted the most relevant group for clinical use, were labeled
with GFP to visualize them 30 and 60 days after transplantation.
Animals
Experiments were performed after acceptance by the local
Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments in Normandy: N/02-
11-10/22/11-13 in accordance with the French law on the
protection of animals.
For this study, 95 8-weeks old and 30 3–4 weeks old male inbred
Fischer rats were used (Charles River, L’Arbresle, France).
Individual rats were identified by implantation of glass tag
(Biolog-id, Bernay, France); glass tag numbers have been used to
perform blindly analyses.
Cell Culture
All cultures have been performed in semi-sterile conditions with
autoclaved surgery tools.
Primary cultures. OB and OM primary cultures were
prepared as described previously with slight modifications
[25,26]. Briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized (isofluorane) and
decapitated. OB from one rat were immediately dissected and
placed in 1 ml of Hank’s buffered salt solution (H.B.S.S,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), after removing the meninges.
H.B.S.S containing 0.1% trypsin (Invitrogen) and OB were
incubated for 45 min at 37uC. Trypsinization was stopped by
adding Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s/Ham’s F12 medium
(D.M.E.M/F12, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (F.B.S, Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (In-
vitrogen) (DF-10S). The tissue was centrifugated at 1.000 RPM for
3 min, resuspended in DF-10S and centrifugated again. Tissue
was then triturated in 3 ml DF-10S using a micropipette, until a
homogenous cell suspension was obtained. Prior plating, undi-
gested tissue blocks were removed by pipetting. Then, cells were
plated (1.5–3.106 cells per flask) in DF-10S in 25 cm2 flasks
(Starlab, Bagneux, France), pre-coated with poly-L-Lysine (50 mg/
Figure 1. Experimental paradigm illustrating the timeline of the major experimental manipulations. Cells or medium were transplanted
into sectioned spinal cords (D0). 15, 30 and 60 days after surgery animals were analyzed for electrophysiological and locomotor activities (D15, D30,
D60). Histological analyses were performed 60 days after transplantation for all the groups (D60) (n = 10). On additional animals of OM-purified OECs
tracking of GFP+ cells were performed 30 and 60 after transplantation (D30, D60). Each time point (n = 3) (in green).

ml, Invitrogen). The flasks were incubated at 37uC, 5% CO2. The
medium was changed every two days. Five days after plating, OB
primary cultures were used for transplantation.
In the same rats, the nasal cavity was opened sagittally with a
spatula and OM was cut in small pieces. Care was taken to avoid
to take cartilage. After a short rinse in H.B.S.S, samples from 1 rat
were digested enzymatically in 1 ml of collagenase A (0.5%) for
45 min at 37uC (Roche Diagnostics, Penzbeg, Germany).The OM
is easily identified in the rat by its posterior position on the nasal
septum and by the yellowish appearance of the epithelial surface.
Care was taken to avoid the anterior edge of the OM which could
have been contaminated with respiratory epithelium. Respiratory
mucosa was removed from the dorso-anterior region of the
septum. Then, samples were cultivated with the same protocol that
for OB cultures [25]. Five days after plating, OM primary cultures
were used for transplantation.
Olfactory ensheathing cells purification. OECs purifica-
tion from OB were performed in using method described by Nash
based on the differing rates of attachment of the various harvested
cell types [32]. Briefly, the method of differential adhesion is based
on a very low adhesion rate of OEC to the surface of uncoated
culture flasks [32,33]. The cell suspension obtained from OB was
resuspended in DF-10S, seeded on uncoated flask and cultured at
37uC with 5% CO2. After 18 h, the supernatant was removed and
re-plated on other uncoated flasks and incubated for additional
36 h. The supernatants from these flasks were removed and re-
plated on 25 cm2 poly-L-lysine-coated culture flasks with DF-10S.
Ten days after plating, OB purified cultures were used for
transplantation.
OECs purification from OM was performed by using the
method described by Bianco and modified by Gueye et al. [34,35].
Briefly, after one week in primary culture, cells were split by
trypsinisation and replated in serum-free culture medium supple-
mented with 25 ng/mL of transforming growth factor a (Sigma
Aldrich, St Louis, MO) onto pre-coated flasks (poly-L-Lysine
50 mg/ml). The second passage was performed 1 week after.
Fourteen days after plating, OM purified cultures were used for
transplantation.
Preparation of the cells for grafting. Before transplanta-
tion, cultures were trypsinized to remove them from the dishes,
and the cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Cultures cells
were resuspended in DF-10S immediately before grafting for a
final concentration of 100,000 cells/ml. Samples of the different
cultures were prepared for characterization as described below.
Flow-cytometry analysis of OECs. In order to characterize
cellular preparations, flow-cytometry analysis was conducted. The
cells were washed with PBS and treated with trypsin/EDTA in
conjunction with the use of a cell scraper to remove adherent cells.
Then, cells were washed with PBS/EDTA and immunolabeled,
during 15 min at 4uC, with the the anti-p75LNGFr (1:100)
(Chemicon, Billerica, MA.). At the end of the incubation, 2 ml of
PBS/EDTA was added and the cells were centrifuged (300 g for
5 min). Cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies
conjugated with phycoerythrin (1:200) for p75 (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA). At the end of the incubation, 2 ml of PBS/EDTA
was added and the cells were centrifuged (300 g for 5 min). Then,
cells were resuspended in 500 ml of PBS/EDTA. The total
number of 10,000 events was analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow-
cytometer (BD Biosciences) directly after the staining procedure.
Data were processed using the FACSdiva program (BD Biosci-
ences). Proportion of p75 positive cells in the various samples was
determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity dot plot
compared to the total amount of non-labeled cells.
Flow cytometry analysis allowed to determinate that OB
primary cultures contained approximately 70% of p75 positive
cells (Figure 2A) and OB purified cultures contained approxi-
mately 97% of p75 positive cells (Figure 2B), whereas in the same
time OM cultures contained about 15% of p75 positive cells
(Figure 2C) and OM purified cultures contained approximately
98% of p75 positive cells (Figure 2D).
GFP labeling of transplanted cells. This evaluation was
performed in 6 other rats for Purified OM group, 3 rats were used
at each time point (30 and 60 days).
Briefly, five days before transplantation, OM-OECs purified
cultures were infected with a lentiviral vector harboring
enhanced GFP (multiplicity of infection: 20, time of exposure
overnight). Efficiently of infection was 80% determined by flow
cytometry as previously described in ‘‘materials and methods’’.
After several washing steps, GFP positive cells were injected as
described below.
Experimental Spinal Cord Lesion and Cell Transplantation
Procedure
For experimental groups, adult Fischer inbred rats (225–250 g)
were used.
All the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine hydrochloride (12.5 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine hydro-
chloride (0.625 mg/kg).
Five groups (n = 10) were classified as follows:
Group 1: Medium group (Md). Complete spinal cord transec-
tion was performed and DF-10S was injected.
Group 2: OB-treated group (Primary OB). Complete spinal
cord transection was performed and primary olfactory bulb
cultures were transplanted.
Group 3: OM-treated group (Primary OM). Complete spinal
cord transection was performed and primary olfactory mucosa
cultures were transplanted.
Group 4: OB OECs-treated group (Purified OB). Complete
spinal cord transection was performed and purified olfactory
ensheathing cells from olfactory bulb were transplanted.
Group 5: OM OECs-treated group (Purified OM). Complete
spinal cord transection was performed and purified olfactory
ensheathing cells from olfactory mucosa were transplanted.
Control animals (Ctrl) were also used for histological analyses,
for these no surgery was performed.
For all operated groups surgery was performed by the same
operator as follow:
Through a midline dorsal incision, a standard bilateral Th10
laminectomy was performed with great care, in order to visualize
the spinal cord. The dura was opened longitudinally and laterally
at the level of the Th10 dorsal root. Then, the spinal cord was
completely sectioned with a microscalpel, the cord stumps were
lifted and a needle was passed between the two stumps to ensure
completeness of the lesion.
Immediately after spinal cord transection, cells or medium were
transplanted using a 5 ml Hamilton glass syringe, connected to a
27 gauge needle and attached to a micromanipulator. Md treated
animals received injection of DF-10S, and transplanted animals
received cellular preparations. Medium or cells were injected to
the spinal cord on the site of the lesion. Injections were delivered at
spinal sites 1.5 mm laterally from the midline (2 sites) and 2 mm
depth: 1 mm rostrally and 1 mm caudally. Each animal received a
total of 4 injections (461 ml) which contained cellular suspension
(100,000 cells/ml) or DF-10S. The injection was given at 0.5 ml/
min. The delivery needle was left in the injection site for 2 min to
avoid reflux. No immunosuppressant was used.

All the rats were caged individually under heat lamp during 24
hours after surgery and give antibiotics for the first two weeks
(Ceftriaxone, 80 mg/Kg).
Before and after the experiments, rats were kept on standard
laboratory food and tap water ad libitum, with an artificial 12
hours light/dark cycle and caged by threes.
During all the experiments the bladder was compressed every
day by manual abdominal pressure and rats were washed daily.
Despite all the precautions taken a high morbidity has been
recorded, around 30%, thereby to obtain 10 rats in every group 15
rats per group were operated. 95 rats have been used for this
study.
Evaluation
Evaluations were performed 15, 30 and 60 days after surgery for
electrophysiological and behavioral analyses and at 60 days after
surgery for histological analysis on 10 rats per group.
Tracking of GFP positive OECs was performed at 30 and 60
days after surgery on 6 other rats for Purified OM treated group.
Experimental schedule is described in Figure 1.
Electrophysiological studies. Measurement of cord dorsum
potentials (CDP) was recorded. For this, rats were anaesthetized
with ketamine hydrochloride (30 mg/kg) in order to induce slight
sedation. Then, an electrode was placed sub-cutaneaously in the
abdomen of the rats for electrical isolation and CDP were
recorded using two recording electrodes placed in gastrocnemius
muscles separated by 5 mm. Firstly, spinal cord has been
stimulated in sub-lesional to validate the record. Stimulations
were performed at Th2 level (above the lesion site) using a
magnetic stimulator (Magstrim, Rapid 2H) by 5 stimulations
separated by 30 seconds with an intensity of 90% for supra
maximal response. Then, amplitude was recorded and averaged
for each animal.
Measurement of locomotor activity. Measurement of
locomotor activity was performed as described previously [36].
Animals were placed individually in 40640630 cm compart-
ments, in a lighted and quiet room. Locomotor activity was
assessed automatically in a computerized actimeter (Versamax,
AccuScan Instruments Inc, Ohio, USA), which monitored the
horizontal displacements and vertical movements, including
vertical time and vertical activity. The responses were expressed
as the total number of beams crossed (horizontal and vertical
activity) and as time passed vertically (vertical time) by rats during
six consecutive 10-minutes periods.
CatWalk gait analysis. CatWalk gait analysis was per-
formed as described elsewhere [37]. Briefly, the animals crossed a
horizontal glass runway equipped with a standard CCD camera
connected to a computer with the CatWalk software (Noldus
Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). Animals
were tested for at least three uninterrupted runs per animal.
Coordination and different individual paw parameters were
assessed to quantify functional recovery.
Histological studies. All the histological analyses were
performed blindly.
In order to verify the correlation between electrophysiological,
locomotor and anatomical recovery, we performed immunostain-
ing for axonal regrowth, astrocyte reactivity, glial scar and
inflammatory response. Briefly, anaesthetized rats were transcar-
dially perfused first with ice-cold PBS for 2 min and then 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Spinal cord segments were
collected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at
4uC. After cryopreservation in 30% sucrose at 4uC, spinal cord
tissue was cut into longitudinal sections (20 mm) on a cryostat.
Following two rinses in PBS, sections on slides were permeabilized
using PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Sections
were incubated 30 min at room temperature with the correspond-
ing primary antibody: anti-GFAP (1/200, Chemicon, Billerica,
MA), anti-neurofilament H (1/200, Chemicon), anti-Neurocan (1/
200, Chemicon) and anti-ED1 (1/200, Chemicon). To assess the
specificity of the staining, positive and negative controls have been
used prior to the experiments. In addition for each experiment, to
measure background, slides without primary antibodies were used.
Following primary antibody incubation, sections for ED1 and
neurocan stainings were incubated 30 min at room temperature
with the PE-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1/500 BD Biosci-
ences). GFAP and neurofilament antibodies were conjugated with
Alexa FluorH 488. Images were analyzed and captured with a
fluorescence microscope equipped with apotome (1006; Axio-
scope; Zeiss). Then, immunodensitometry were performed by
outlining areas measuring 1.4106 pixels (2.15 mm2) for GFAP,
neurofilament, neurocan and ED1 stainings using ImageJ software
(NIH software). For this, number of positive pixels was counted
using the measure tool of ImageJ based on the threshold defined
Figure 2. P75 expression of primary OB (A) and OM (C) and purified OB-OECs (B) and OM-OECs (D) cultures. After 5 and 10 days
in vitro, cell surface expression of p75 in primary OB and purified OB cultures was determined by flow cytometry. Primary OB cultures were positive
for p75 at 70% (A), whereas, OB purified cultures were positive for p75 at 97% (B). At the same time, After 5 and 14 days in vitro cell surface
expression of p75, respectively, in primary OM and purified OM cultures was determined by flow cytometry. Primary OM cultures were positive for
p75 at 15% (C), whereas, OM purified cultures were positive for p75 at 98% (D). Numbers indicate the total population and the percentage of cells
present in the indicated gated region.

with control animals (without surgery) as described by Stamegna
et al. [19].
To address the localization of transplanted OM-OECs into the
spinal cord, GFP-Neurofilament co-staining was performed using
anti GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Stainings
were performed as described previously.
MRI. Experiments were performed 7 days after spinal cord
transection in 4 other rats for Md, primary OB and purified OM
treated groups (140–160 g) on a 7 Tesla Pharmascan magnet
(Bruker, Germany) in anesthetized rats (1.5% isoflurane in O2/
N2O 33%/67%). Sagittal T2-weighted images were acquired with
relaxation enhancement (RARE) with an accelerating factor of 4
(TR=, 6000 ms, TE= 40 ms, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, planar
resolution of 100 mm * 100 mm, acquisition time , 35 minutes).
Image analysis was performed using Image J software.
Statistics
Prism software (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA.) was used for
statistics. All data, except for Catwalk analysis, are presented as
means 6 SEM. Nonparametric test was used (Kruskal-Wallis),
followed by a post test (Dunns), to identify differences between the
groups. For CatWalk analyses data are presented as percentage of
runs succeed and failed and a Fisher’s exact test was performed.
Differences were accepted as statistically significant at *p,0.05,
**p,0.01, or, and ***p,0.001.
Results
Electrophysiological Studies
Stimulations were performed above the lesion site and CDP
were measured using electrodes placed in gastrocnemius muscles.
These analyses showed that at D15, all OECs treated groups
presented a significant improvement of the CDP amplitudes in
comparison to the Md group (p,0.05) (Figure 3A). Increase of
CDP amplitudes persisted for the full time duration of the
experiment for all OECs treated groups. In fact, all OECs treated
groups showed at D30 and D60 significantly higher CDP
amplitudes in comparison to the Md group (p,0.05) (Figures 3B
and C). For this analysis no difference could be observed between
the different OECs treated groups (Figure 3). These results
demonstrate that transplantations of different types of OECs
equally induce electrophysiological recovery from early (D15) to
late time points (D60).
Behavioral Studies
Measurement of locomotor activity. Measurement of
horizontal activity revealed that during the full duration of the
experiment all groups presented no significant difference for this
parameter (Figures 4A–C). These results demonstrate that all
groups have the same ability to move and to explore. At D15 and
D30 all the groups showed no significant difference for vertical
activity and vertical time (Figures 4D–E and G–H). However, at
D60, Primary OB and Purified OM treated groups presented a
significant higher vertical activity (p,0.05) in comparison to the
Md treated group (Figure 4F). Similarly, at D60 Primary OB and
Purified OM treated groups presented a significantly higher
vertical time (p,0.05) in comparison to the Md treated group
(Figure 4I). These results indicate that Primary OB and Purified
OM can promote locomotor activity, in particular ability to stand
up and to maintain a standing position, at later time (D60).
CatWalk gait analysis. This analysis revealed that for all
time points analyzed there was no significant differences between
all the groups, due to a high intra-group dispersion (data not
shown). However, contingency analysis was performed. For this,
we have counted all the runs performed by the animals during the
three distinct periods (D15 to D60). Then, we have counted the
number of successes and failures based on the ability of animals to
have walking into the corridor and we have determined the ratio
of successes and failures for each group. This analysis showed that
Primary OB, Purified OB and Purified OM treated groups
displayed a significantly higher rate of runs succeed in comparison
to the Md treated animals. Indeed, 0% of the Md treated group
has been walking during all the runs, in comparison, 21.6% of the
Primary OB (p,0.05), 26% of the Purified OB (0.01,p,0.001)
and 36.7% of the Purified OM treated animals (p,0.001) were
able to walk into the corridor during all the runs (Table 1).
Moreover, Purified OM treated group showed a significantly
higher probability to walk in comparison to the Primary OM
treated animals (p,0.05).These results demonstrate that Primary
OB, Purified OB and Purified OM treated groups, but not
Primary OM treated group can improve ability to walk.
Histological Analysis
All the histological analyses were performed on longitudinal
sections. At D60, histological analyses on an equivalent area
revealed that Primary OB, Purified OB and Purified OM treated
groups presented a significantly higher staining for neurofilament,

to increase potential amplitude from all OECs treated groups at all-time points studied (A–C). Md: Medium, OB: Olfactory Bulb, OM: Olfactory Mucosa.

used as a marker of axonal regrowth, in comparison to Md treated
group (p,0.05) (Figure 5A). Primary OM treated group did not
show difference with Md treated group (Figure 5A). Representa-
tive pictures are presented for each group for neurofilament
staining (Figures 5B–F). Conversely, similar histological analyses
revealed that all OECs treated groups presented a significantly
lower staining for GFAP, used as a marker of astrocyte reactivity,
in comparison to Md treated group (p,0.05) (Figure 5G) [38].
Representative pictures are presented for each group for GFAP
staining (Figures 5H–L). We also performed neurocan staining, an
extracellular matrix (ECM) protein present in the glial scar, and
showed that all OECs treated groups presented a significant
reduction for this staining (0.01,p,0.001for Primary OM and
OB treated groups and p,0.001 for Purified OB and OM treated
groups) in comparison to Md treated group (Figure 5M). Of
interest, Purified OM treated group showed the greatest reduction
of neurocan staining (p,0.05). Representative pictures are
presented for each group for neurocan staining (Figures 5O–S).
At D60, there was no difference in ED1 staining, used as a
marker of activated microglia, monocytes and macrophages,
between all groups. In fact, all groups presented a high ED1+
invasion into the spinal cord parenchyma (Figure 5T). Represen-
tative pictures are presented for each group for ED1 staining
(Figures 5U–Y).Complementary analyses were performed in order

but no difference could be observed between the groups (data not

Figure 5. Histological analyses. Histological analyses on longitudinal sections were performed for neurofilament (A), GFAP (G), Neurocan (M) and

OM or OB-OECs had no effect on macrophage phenotype in
culture (data not shown).
Altogether, these results demonstrate that all OECs treated
groups presented a reduction of GFAP (astrocyte reactivity) and
neurocan (glial scar component) stainings in comparison to Md
treated group and in particular Purified OM treated group
displayed a significantly greater reduction of neurocan expression
in comparison to all the other OECs treated groups. However it
could be demonstrated that Primary OB, Purified OB and Purified
OM treated groups and not Primary OM treated group showed an
increase of the axonal regrowth (neurofilament) in comparison to
Md treated group.
MRI Analysis
To further address the inflammatory infiltrate and formation of
the glial scar at early time point after surgery and/or cellular
transplantation, we performed MRI experiments after 7 days. For
this analysis 4 other rats of Md, Primary OB and Purified OM
treated groups, which showed higher potential to promote
recovery, were used. Transplanted animals (Figures 6C and D)
presented a reduction of the signal intensity (delimited by white
areas) in comparison to the hyperintense sequences of the Md
treated animals (Figure 6B). This result based on T2* IRM
sequences indicates that OEC transplantations reduce inflamma-
tory infiltrate and edema into the spinal cord parenchyma at early
time. Animals without surgery served as control (Figure 6A).
Tracking of GFP+ OM-OECs
For this analysis, 6 other rats for Purified OM treated group,
which constituted the most relevant group for clinical use, were
used. Tracking of GFP+ OM-OECs was performed 30 and 60
days after surgery on 3 rats for each time point. Histological
analyses, based on longitudinal sections, revealed that a similarly
high number of GFP+ cells could be found at the lesion site and
both distally (Figures 7C and F) and proximally (Figures 7A and D)
to the injection site at both time points in all the rats transplanted.
Image analysis demonstrated that OECs were spread on a
distance of 1.5 cm and on a maximal distance of the injection sites
of around 0.35 cm. It should be noted that the lesion site did not
show gap 60 days after transplantation (white arrows) (Figure 7E)
in contrary to 30 days after transplantation (Figure 7B).
To address the localization of OECs into the spinal cord, GFP-
Neurofilament co-staining was performed and shows that OECs
were closely associated to neurofilament 30 and 60 days after
surgery (Figures 7G–I2).
Altogether, these results demonstrate that OM-OECs can
survive up to 60 days, migrate and are associated with regrowing
axons in the lesioned spinal cord.
Discussion
Numerous reports have attempted to address the role of OECs
transplantations after SCI using different experimental paradigms
[13,38–42]. However, none of these studies has directly compared
the therapeutic benefit of OM and OB-OECs, from primary or
purified cultures, by electrophysiological, functional and histolog-
ical analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first report which
described by a multi-parametric approach the effects of OECs
from different sources in a severe SCI model.
For our study we have chosen a complete transection model due
to the fact that this model is easily reproducible and induces a
permanent disability on lesioned animals [43,44]. To ensure of the
completeness and the reproducibility of the section all the surgeries
have been performed by the same operator (A.M) and preliminary
animals have been used in which we have performed immediate
electrophysiology analyses after transection for demonstrating the
abolition of the electrical signal.
Locomotor activity and catwalk tests have been chosen
preferentially to BBB to monitor functional recovery, because
they are computer-assisted analysis and allow to collect quantita-
tive data with a great precision. Indeed, lomomotor activity
analyses revealed that all the lesioned animals have the same
horizontal activity (ability to move), however OECs transplanta-
tions specifically induce stand up ability in Primary OB and
Purified OM treated animals. These results prove that Md animals
were specifically not able to stand up (Figure 4).

Potential of OECs for Spinal Cord Repair
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62860
Our results demonstrate that transplantation of OECs consti-
tutes a very promising therapy for SCI independently of their
source. Indeed, OECs induced electrophysiological and functional
recovery (Figures 3 and 4 and Table 1), reduced astrocyte
reactivity and glial scar (based on neurocan expression) and
improved axonal regrowth (Figure 5). Interestingly, ED1 staining
revealed that OECs seem to have no effect on macrophage/
microglia response 60 days after SCI (Figure 5). To further address
ability of OECs to modulate processes and formation of the glial
scar at early time point after surgery and/or cellular transplan-
tation MRI analyses were performed. Seven days after surgery the
MRI sequences in treated groups showed a reduction of the signal
intensity in comparison to the untreated group. These results could
be interpreted as a reduction of the inflammatory infiltrate and
edema or as a reduction of the cystic cavities. Both of these
hypotheses seem to indicate a decrease of the inflammatory
processes 7 days after surgery in transplanted groups (Primary OB
and Purified OM groups). Our results show equally that electric
recovery (based on measurement of cord dorsum potentials)
appeared early after transplantation (D15) in treated groups.
However, this recovery is followed by later functional recovery in
primary OB and purified OM-OECs treated groups (D60). These
results could be probably explained by the fact that to induce
functional recovery, neurons have not only to regrowth but also to
form connections to constitute neuronal network.
Although no significant difference about functional recovery can
be showed between OB-Primary and OM-Purified groups, our
study highlights that OECs obtained and purified from OM
present the best benefit/risk ratio. This result is a fundamental
point for a future human clinical application, due to the fact that
OM is the more accessible source for OECs.
In our study, as previously reported, purification of primary
cultures has no effect in case of transplantation of OECs obtained
from OB (Figures 3–5 and Table 1) which can be explained in
several ways [24]. First, deprivation of microenvironment induces
a loss of the two distinct subpopulations of OECs present in
primary OB cultures, leading to a decrease in the recovery of the
treated animals [21]. Secondly the rate of OECs is around 70% in
primary OB cultures which might not be a limiting factor for
functional and anatomical recovery in our SCI model. Finally, the
‘‘fibroblast-like’’ cells present in primary OB cultures may play an
important role for the integration of OECs in the spinal cord
[28,45]. Indeed, a recent study has underlined the main role of
fibroblasts on SC for axonal regrowth after Wallerian degenera-
tion in peripheral nerve injury (PNI) [46]. It could be reasonably
envisaged, due to the common origin of SC and OECs, that
‘‘fibroblast-like’’ cells have the same influence on OECs, even in
the case of transplantation in a lesioned spinal cord [14,47].
In contrast, purification of OECs from OM cultures improves
significantly both functional and anatomical recoveries which is
highly relevant for future clinical applications. Several hypotheses
could explain the differences observed between primary and
purified cultures upon transplantation. First, primary OM cultures
have a relatively low content of OECs (15%) which could explain
the poor functional recovery of this group. Nevertheless, several
studies have reported benefic functional effects after transplanta-
tion of low dose of OECs [16,48]. Another hypothesis is that
contaminating cells present in primary OM cultures inhibit axonal
regrowth. In our study, histological analyses revealed that Primary
OM treated group displayed no difference according to neurofil-
ament staining in comparison to Md group, whereas in the same
time Purified OM treated group showed a significant increase for
this parameter (p,0.05) (Figure 5). We previously have reported
that transplantation of primary OM cultures after PNI induces
functional recovery without improvement of axonal regrowth [23].
The microenvironment present in primary OM cultures could also
induce a higher mortality after cellular transplantation. One last
hypothesis is that the purification method used, based on privative
medium, might induce modification or selection of specific cell
subpopulations. A recent study has reported that primary OM
cultures contain distinct populations of cells, assumed to be OECs,
therefore serum deprivation may select specifically one of them
[49]. Complementary studies should be performed to address this
specific point.
Previous studies have compared OM and OB-OECs in both
in vitro cultures and after PNI in vivo [23,50,51]. They have shown
some differences such as distinct ability to induce axonal regrowth,
to modulate ECM and to interact with primary olfactory neurons
[23,50,51]. In our present study, no major differences in functional
recovery after transplantation of OM and OB-OECs were
observed upon SCI (Figures 3–5). However, our histological
analyses revealed a significant difference between these groups. In
fact, neurocan staining showed that Purified OM group presented
a significant reduction of this parameter in comparison to Primary
OB and Purified OB treated groups (p,0.05) (Figure 5). Recently,
it was discovered that ADAMTS-4 could play a major role in
degradation of the glial scar. Indeed, chondroitin sulfate proteo-
glycans (CSPG) are a major component of the glial scar with
axonal growth inhibitory properties. Recently, it was shown that
ADAMTS-4 could degrade CSPG as neurocan, brevican and
phosphacan in vitro and in vivo and that local administration of
ADAMTS-4 can promote functional recovery after SCI [4]. We
have previously shown that ADAMTS-4 is more highly expressed
by OM-OECs than by OB-OECs in vitro [20]. We have further
confirmed this result at the protein level (data not shown). Previous
studies have demonstrated the ability of OM-OECs to modulate
the ECM [35,52]. Therefore, complementary studies on the
capacity of OM-OECs, in particular the potential role of
ADAMTS-4 to regulate glial scar, should be conducted.
Visualization of GFP labeled OM-OECs showed that they were
present and closely associated to neurofilament+ fibers (Figure 6).
We showed that OM-OECs could migrate into the injured spinal
cord and survive for up to 60 days. OM-OECs, in our model,
migrated up to 3.5 mm, a distance close to previously reported
genetically modified SC (4.4 mm) [8]. These results highlight the
potential of OM-OECs to migrate and to integrate into the injured
spinal cord.
Altogether, the accessibility and the recovery properties of
OECs allow to propose them as a future relevant biotherapy for
spinal cord repair. Several types of cellular transplantations have
been tested to promote SCI recovery in rodent models, however
few of these could be proposed for clinical use. In fact for a human
application, the cells must be easily sampled and cultured even
from adult, must present weak risk of teratogenicity and must
induce functional recovery. OECs have all these advantages and
criteria. Specifically, OM-OECs can be obtained from nasal
biopsies and cultured with high purity and present a high benefit/
risk balance due to the fact that OECs are differentiated cells, are
stable even after long term cultures from adult primates and
induce functional and anatomical recoveries [29,34].
We have demonstrated the potential of different OECs sources.
However a better molecular understanding on the culture effect
and subpopulations will further strengthen the clinical potential
and use of OECs for SCI.
