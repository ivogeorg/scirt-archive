In mammals, spinal cord injury results in gliosis and limited
cellular regeneration, leading to devastating conditions
(Thuret et al. 2006). In contrast, larval cyclostomes, some
teleosts, and tailed amphibians keep substantial endogenous
repair capabilities with restoration of locomotion after injury
(Tanaka and Ferretti 2009). It is generally accepted that
urodeles are the most evolved vertebrates with a robust
regenerative potential of the adult spinal cord (Stensaas, 1983).
However, we have shown (Rehermann et al. 2009) that
freshwater turtles are able to reconnect their transected spinal
cords, leading to some degree of recovery of motor functions.
In contrast to mammals, no glial scar is observed in turtles but
instead regenerating axons cross the injured site approximately
20 days after the lesion. These regenerating axons travel on a
scaffold formed by newly generated glial cells that express the
brain lipid binding protein (BLBP) and/or the glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) (Rehermann et al. 2009, 2011).
The endogenous repair of the spinal cord in turtles may be
linked to the existence of domains of progenitor cells lining the
central canal (CC). These cells exhibit proliferative capacity,
are coupled via connexin 43 (Cx43), and express both BLBP
and the transcription factor Pax6 (Russo et al. 2008). It is
believed that connexins play an important role in the regulation
of proliferation, migration, and cell differentiation (Bruzzone
andDermietzel 2006). In particular, Cx43 appears essential for
maintaining neural progenitors in a proliferative state (Duval
et al. 2002; Cheng et al. 2004). BLBP is a member of the large
family of hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins that modulate
transcription through their interactions with nuclear receptors
(Haunerland and Spener 2004) and is required to induce

Abstract
The spinal cord of the freshwater turtle Trachemys dorbignyi
regenerates after complete transection (Rehermann et al.
J. Comp. Neurol. 515, 2009, 197–214). This remarkable ability
may be related to the persistence around the central canal
(CC) of progenitors functionally clustered via connexin 43
(Cx43) that express brain lipid binding protein (BLBP) and the
transcription factor Pax6 (Russo et al. J. Neurosci. 28, 2008,
8510–8516). Indeed, because BLBP+ cells appear in the
bridge joining the rostral and caudal stumps, we speculated
that progenitors contacting the central canal may play a key
part in spinal cord regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we
designed degenerated primers pairing conserved regions for
key proteins synthesized in progenitors (BLBP, Cx43, and
Pax6) and the neuronal protein HuB. Fragments of these
proteins were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Based on
these sequences, we analyzed the changes in the expression
levels using quantitative real-time RT-PCR with specific
primers, comparing the injured spinal cord at different times
after injury (4, 12, 20, and 60 days) with uninjured spinal
cords. We found a transient, early increase of BLBP, Cx43
and HuB mRNA, with Pax6 remaining unchanged. These re-
sults suggest that the selected genes – active in progenitor
cells – play an important part in early mechanisms of spinal
cord regeneration.

morphological changes in radial glial (RG) in response to
neuronal cues (Feng et al. 1994; Anton et al. 1997). Finally,
the transcription factor Pax6 is expressed in RG lining the
ventricle cavities and is an important regulator of the
neurogenic capabilities of progenitors during development
(Heins et al. 2002; Pinto and Götz 2007) and in neurogenic
niches of the adult brain (Kohwi et al. 2005). In the spinal
cord, Pax6 is part of the transcriptional code that determines
subsets of progenitors giving rise to specific neuronal types
(Lee and Pfaff 2001), controlling the tempo of neuronal
differentiation (Bel-Vialar et al. 2007).
Because the persistence of CC-contacting progenitors may
be one of the central features supporting the outstanding
regeneration capability in turtles (Rehermann et al. 2009,
2011), we hypothesized that spinal cord injury may trigger
changes in the expression of key genes that drive protein
synthesis in these cells. To test this idea, we selected the
BLBP, Pax6, and Cx43 genes expressed in CC-contacting
progenitors and HuB, a gene active from the earliest stages of
neuronal differentiation (Marusich et al. 1994). Because
there is no information about the sequence of these genes in
turtles, we first designed degenerate oligonucleotides priming
conserved regions of the genes, together with specific
primers for the putative control genes pyruvate kinase (PK)
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). We next amplified
fragments of these genes, cloned, and sequenced them.
Based on these data, we analyzed the changes in mRNA
expression levels using real-time RT-PCR with specific
primers, comparing injured segments (T10-11) with their
counterparts in control animals at different time points after
spinal cord transection. To analyze the spatial profile of the
change in gene expression, we performed immunohisto-
chemistry in injured and normal animals. Our results
revealed significant increments in the expression of BLBP,
Cx43, and HuB genes 4 days after injury while Pax6
remained unchanged at the same time point. However, BLBP
and Cx43 returned to normal values around day 12, a time
point when anatomical reconnection is still incipient (Reher-
mann et al. 2009). Conversely, Hu remained underexpressed
at 12, 20, and 60 days post injury. The immunohistochemical
data showed that the spatial profile of expression of these
genes was conserved in spinal cord stumps. Our findings
suggest that modulation of BLBP and Cx43 gene expression
is transiently involved in the early plasticity triggered by
spinal cord injury. It remains to be clarified whether this early
response is instrumental for later stages of post-transcrip-
tional mechanisms commanding endogenous neural repair.
Methods
Animals
Fresh-water turtles (Trachemys dorbignyi, 5–12 cm carapace length)
were used (n = 22). These juvenile turtles (2 months to 1 year old)
behave like fully mature animals in terms of their sensory-motor
behavior. The animals were maintained in temperate aquaria (24–
26C) under natural illumination and fed daily with small
earthworms. The ARRIVE guidelines have been followed, and all
experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the
ethical guidelines established by our local Committee for Animal
Care and Research at the Instituto de Investigaciones Biológicas
Clemente Estable. Every precaution was taken to minimize animal
stress and the number of animals used.
Surgical procedures
The detailed surgical procedures to lesion the spinal cord have been
described elsewhere (Rehermann et al. 2009). Briefly, animals were
sedated by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine chlorhydrate
(40 mg/kg b.w.). Then, the legs were secured to a rigid support
by means of rubber bands, and complete anesthesia was achieved by
inhalation of isofluorane (1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluorom-
ethyl ether; Forane, Abbot Laboratories, Berkshire, UK). To prevent
infection, we rubbed the carapace with a cotton pad previously
immersed in an alcohol-iodine solution, and all surgical instruments
were sterilized by using chemical procedures. After the animal was
unresponsive to nociceptive stimuli, we opened a window in the
carapace following the limits of the third dorsal scute to expose the
spinal cord. Complete transection of the spinal cord (T10-11) was
performed with a thin-blade scalpel. After washing the injured site
with sterile saline, we replaced the lifted scute and sealed the injured
carapace with cyanoacrylate adhesive.
Post-operative care
We identified spinalized turtles with indelible marks sculptured on
their carapace. Turtles do not require special post-operative care
because, as described for other non-mammalian vertebrates (Mount-
castle 1980), spinal shock is very short. Because turtles have a
primitive ‘‘allantoic bladder’’ opening into the cloaca (Parker and
Harwell 1949), there is no noticeable urine retention. Despite their
reduced motor capabilities, injured turtles were able to catch living
worms a few days after surgery.
Tissue preparation
For the cloning and sequencing of the genes of interest, the whole
spinal cords (n = 3) were rapidly removed and placed in RNAlater
(Sigma) for storage at )80C. For quantitative real-time PCR
analysis, we studied a total of 12 turtles that were examined using
the following protocol: three turtles were killed 4 days after surgery;
three turtles were killed 12 days after surgery; three turtles were
killed 20 days after surgery; three turtles were killed 60 days after
surgery. In all cases, a 4-mm long spinal cord segment centered on
the lesion epicenter was quickly dissected out, placed in RNAlater
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and stored at )80C. The
corresponding spinal cord segments of control-uninjured and sham-
injured animals were processed in the same way.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription
The tissue was mechanically homogenized using a Cordless motor
and pellet pestle (Sigma-Aldrich). Total RNA from the spinal cord
was extracted and purified using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The
concentrations of RNA samples were quantified using the Nanodrop
(Nano-Drop Inc., Rockland, DE, USA). RNA integrity was
determined using Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,

CA, USA), and only samples with a RNA Integrity Number (RIN)
higher than 7 were used for reverse transcription (Figure S1). For
spinal cord segments of injured and uninjured animals, cDNA
synthesis was performed using the same amount of starting RNA
(0.5 lg). The enzyme Superscript III was used (Invitrogen) primed
with oligo(dT) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cloning and sequencing
Degenerated and specific primers were designed to hybridize highly
conserved regions of the genes of interest coding sequences
(Table 1). The PCR products amplified from spinal cord cDNA
were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. When needed, gel
purification was performed with the kit GenElute gel extraction kit
(Sigma-Aldrich). PCR products were cloned using the pGEMT Easy
Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Colonies were
selected and plasmids purified from 3 ml of liquid media LB. Inserts
were sequenced with Sp6 and T7 universal primers using an
ABI3130 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) DNA
automatic sequencer. Sequences from multiple clones were aligned
to generate consensus sequences, which were then used in
nucleotide basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) searches to
retrieve orthologous ones.
Alignment of amplified gene fragments with orthologs from other
vertebrates was done online with ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/msa/clustalw2/). We used the online ExPASy tool (http://
ca.expasy.org/tools/dna.html) for in silico translation of nucleotide
sequences to examine conservation at the amino acid level.
Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis
Four-millimeter long segments of spinal cord centered on the lesion
epicenter were compared with corresponding segments of control
animals. Injured animals (n = 3 for each time point) were killed at
different times post injury (4, 12, 20, and 60 days). With the cloned
sequences, specific primers were designed for amplifying small
fragments ( 200 pb, Table 2). Using a real-time cycler Rotor Gene
6000 (Corbett Research, Bath, UK) and SYBR Green I, the genes of
interest were amplified. Briefly, each reaction tube contained 5 lL
of 2X SYBR Green Quantimix solution (Biotools), 250 nM of each
forward and reverse primer, 0.5 lL of cDNA and water to bring the
total reaction volume to 10 lL. The thermal profile was 95C for
5 min followed by 40 cycles of three steps (95C for 15 s, 55C for
20 s, and 72C for 20 s). The PCR for each cDNA sample and
plasmid DNA standard was performed in duplicate.
Control reactions were performed to verify the absence of
genomic DNA and cross contamination of any other DNA source. A
melting temperature analysis was added at the end of each real-time
PCR to verify that a single product was amplified for each gene
analyzed.
Standard curve construction
Because the intended housekeeping genes LDH and PK changed
dramatically following spinal cord transection (data not shown), we
used an absolute transcript quantification method. The plasmidic
vectors pGEM-T easy (Promega) containing the sequences of interest
used previously were also used for the construction of the standard
curves which were based on real-time PCR of known quantities of
plasmidic DNA. Each standard curve was generated based on five 10-
fold serial dilutions of a starting concentration of DNA (100 pg/lL)
converted to the number of copies using the molecular mass of the
DNA: Attomoles (amoles) of input plasmid DNA = 1.52 · amount
of input plasmid DNA/plasmid length, according toWu et al. (2005).
A standard curve plotting CT values against the logarithm of input
DNA copy quantity (log amoles) was constructed for each gene. The
number of copies in the experimental samples was calculated from the
equation of the line for the standard curve.
Data analysis
Standard DNAs, negative controls, and cDNA obtained from
uninjured animals and samples obtained at different times after
injury (4, 12, 20, and 60 days) were run simultaneously for each of

the genes analyzed. The data for the uninjured controls were
presented as amole/lg RNA ± SEM, and the relative gene expres-
sion data for the different times after injury were expressed as the
ratio to the amole/lg RNA of the sample divided by the same value
in the control. Statistical significance was evaluated with the
unpaired t-test at p < 0.05.
Immunohistochemistry
The spinal cords of anesthetized turtles (50 mg/kg pentobarbital)
were fixed by intracardiac perfusion. For immunohistochemistry
(n = 6 animals), we used 10% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4). Fixed material was sectioned in the
transverse plane (60–80 lm) with a vibrating-blade microtome. We
used the following primary antibodies: (i) anti-BLBP (rabbit
polyclonal, 1:1000; Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA);
(ii) anti-HuC/D (mouse monoclonal, 1:50; Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR), (iii) anti-Cx43 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:3000; kindly
provided by Dr. J.C. Saez; PUC University, Santiago, Chile), and
(iv) anti-GFAP (mouse monoclonal, 1:500, Sigma). Non-specific
reactive sites were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PB
(1 h) followed by overnight incubation with the primary antibody in
PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After blocking and washing, the
tissues were incubated with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse
secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:1.000, 2 h;
Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). Finally, the sections were thor-
oughly washed and mounted. Control experiments replacing
antibodies with pre-immune serum and negative controls without
primary antibodies were routinely performed.
Since Cx43 immunohistochemistry revealed a dotted pattern, it
was possible to use an automatic counting procedure. The number of
punctae was quantified from four confocal optical sections of control
animals and turtles with the transected spinal cord at 4 and 12 days
post injury (DPI). For this purpose, we used the command Analyze
particles of ImageJ (available at http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), after
setting appropriately the threshold level.
Results
Cloning and sequencing
Because the complete genome of any chelonian has not been
sequenced yet, there is no genetic information available for
performing a BLAST analysis or for the design of specific
primers. To overcome this limitation, we did multiple
alignments of the sequences of interest (PAX6, Cx43, Hu
protein and BLBP) and designed degenerated primers of
highly conserved regions. For the fragments of housekeeping
genes (LDH and PK), we designed specific primers based on
sequences from Trachemys scripta (Table 1). With these
primers, PCR was performed with cDNA under conditions
optimized for each gene obtaining amplified PCR fragments
of the expected size (Fig. 1).
The PCR products were then purified and cloned in the
pGEM-T vector, and multiple clones were sequenced and
aligned to generate consensus sequences, which were then
used in nucleotide BLAST searches to retrieve orthologous
genes. The deduced aminoacidic sequences were aligned
with orthologs from other organisms from different taxa.
Interestingly, all the cloned genes exhibited a very high
degree of conservation at the aminoacidic level. HuB
displayed the highest level of conservation (Fig. 2): 100%
when compared with a bird (Gallus gallus), 98% with two
mammals (Mus musculus and Homo sapiens) and an
amphibian (Xenopus laevis). PAX6 also presented a very
high level of conservation, being more than 93%when
compared with birds (Columba livia and G. gallus), mam-
mals (Rattus norvergicus and H. sapiens), and amphibians
(X. laevis) (Fig. 3). Moreover, Cx43 of T. dorbignyi
exhibited an identity higher than 77% when compared with
G. gallus, M. musculus, H. sapiens, and Danio rerio (Fig. 4).
Finally for BLBP, the identity level was 76% with Salmo
salar, 73% with G. gallus, 71% with X. laevis, 69% with
H. sapiens, and 65% with R. norvergicus (Fig. 5).
LDH and PK also displayed high conservation degrees
when compared with other organisms (data not shown,
accession numbers: JQ356536 and JQ356537, respectively).
Standard curves for quantification and identification of
the amplicons
The standard curves for the genes of interest were appropri-
ate for quantitative analyses (Figure S2). The average slope
of the Ct versus initial template plots was )3.39 ± 0.05 SD
and the mean of the efficiency was 97 ± 2% SD (n = 5).
These values were similar to the predicted ones (slope and
efficiency for the 10-fold dilutions, )3.3 and 100%), being
the average correlation (r2) of all the standard curves
0.993 ± 0.004. The melting curve analysis for each target
gene showed a unique peak not observed in the correspond-
ing negative control.
Gel electrophoresis of real-time PCR products is shown in
Fig. 6. A single band was detected at the expected size for
each target gene, whereas no band was observed in the

negative controls. To confirm that the expected genes were
amplified, we sequenced the real-time PCR products,
obtaining the expected sequences in all cases (data not
shown). Thus, each target molecule was amplified and
detected with the primer sets used.
Gene expression in the uninjured spinal cord
To analyze the possible changes in expression induced by
injury, we first characterized the expression of the genes of
interest in the normal spinal cord. We originally examined
the expression relative to potential reference genes (LDH,
PK), but as they changed dramatically after injury, we chose
to express data as amole/lg RNA to reflect actual alterations
in vivo following a strategy used by Wu et al. (2005).
Figure 7 shows the absolute quantity of the mRNA for target
genes in uninjured spinal cords. Cx43 was the most
expressed gene with 244 ± 30 amole/lg RNA. BLBP
mRNA was the next most abundant gene product with an
expression of 52 ± 6 amole/lg RNA, followed by HuB
(21 ± 2 amole/lg RNA). Finally, the mRNA for PAX6 was
the least abundant: 11 ± 1 amole/lg RNA.
Changes in gene expression levels after injury
Real-time PCR with specific primers based in our sequences
allowed us to identify differences in the expression level of
Cx43, HuB, PAX6, and BLBP when compared with control.
In each case, the data values were presented as the ratio to the
amole/ug RNA of the sample divided by the same value in
control (Fig 8). Cx 43 was the gene that showed the highest
level of over-expression, being 1.7 ± 0.1 folds (p < 0.05)
4 days after injury and decreasing to not significantly
different levels in the other time points analyzed. BLBP
was over-expressed 1.5 ± 0.1 times relative to control
(p < 0.05) at 4 days after injury reaching normal levels from
day 12. The expression of HuB also peaked at 4 days after
injury (1.5 ± 0.1, p < 0.01) and significantly decreased
below control levels in the next time point studied
(0.5 ± 0.2, p < 0.05). This down-regulation was unchanged
during the rest of the time course analyzed (0.6 ± 0.1 at 20
and 60 days post injury, p < 0.05). PAX6 was the only gene
that did not change significantly at any time point after
injury. Gene expression for the explored genes in sham-
injured animals – in which all surgical procedures were

performed but the spinal cord was not transected – was not
significantly different to control animals (n = 3; p > 0.2;
4 days after sham injury; Figure S3). These results rule out
an effect on the expression of these genes by the surgery
itself.
Spatial profile of Hu, BLBP, and Cx43 expression
To test whether the changes in gene expression were
accompanied by a change in the spatial profile of expression
for the translated proteins, we did immunohistochemistry for
Hu antigen, BLBP, and Cx43. Because our quantitative real-
time PCR study did not reveal variations in PAX6 expres-
sion, immunohistochemistry for this transcription factor was
not performed.
The expression pattern of Hu, BLBP, and Cx43 in the
spinal cord of injured animals (4 and 12 days after lesion)
and control animals is shown in Fig. 9. The monoclonal
antibody HuC/D – which recognizes the three neuronal
ribosome-associated Hu proteins HuB, HuC, and HuD
(Marusich et al. 1994) – revealed that Hu was strongly
expressed in the cell body around the nucleus of neurons in
the gray matter, with a similar distribution within the gray

were observed at 4 DPI. (Fig. 9C2). Although 12 days after
injury the Cx43 immunoreactivity decayed (Fig. 9C3), the
number of punctae was still higher than control (Figure S4).
Because reactive astrogliosis may partly account for the
increased expression of Cx43 around the CC, we did
immunohistochemistry for GFAP in control and injured
animals (4 DPI). Although the ependyma remained negative
for GFAP, the expression of this protein in the region
surrounding the CC seemed up-regulated at 4 DPI (Fig-
ure S5A). In line with these findings, the expression of the
GFAP gene at 4 DPI was significantly increased compared
with uninjured animals (Figure S5B).
Discussion
Turtles are amniote vertebrates that – unlike mammals – are
able of a substantial degree of endogenous repair, probably
because they retained multi-potent progenitor cells around
the CC (Trujillo-Cenóz et al. 2007; Russo et al. 2008;
Rehermann et al. 2009, 2011). Understanding the molecular
mechanisms involved in injury induced plasticity in new
model systems with efficient self-repair mechanisms may
give important clues for the design of new therapies for
treatment of spinal cord diseases (Tanaka and Ferretti 2009).
A disadvantage of the turtle spinal cord as a model system to
study regeneration is that no genomic resources from
chelonians are available. In the present study, we used a
cloning and sequencing strategy through gene amplification
by degenerated primers design and described the partial
sequences of genes that our previous studies pointed as
potentially important for spinal cord regeneration in turtles
(Rehermann et al. 2009). Surprisingly, our data show a high
level of conservation of the analyzed genes among evolu-
tionary distant organisms, validating the strategy and the
biological model used in this study.
The analysis of mRNA expression changes after spinal
cord transection has been a valuable approach to elucidate
the underlying mechanisms of neural repair (Wu et al. 2005;
Fujiyoshi et al. 2010; Arocho et al. 2011; Kuo et al. 2011;
Nash et al. 2011). A key difference between spinal cord self-
repair capabilities between mammals and turtles may be
related with the persistence of progenitors functionally
clustered via Cx43 and with a molecular phenotype charac-
terized by the expression of BLBP and Pax6 (Russo et al.
2008). By applying quantitative RT-PCR – a highly sensitive
technique allowing the quantification of small changes in
gene expression (Wu et al. 2005) – we found that BLBP and
Cx43 gene expression increased transiently, whereas Pax6
remained unchanged.
The increase in Cx43 mRNA expression induced by injury
in our study resembles the elevation in Cx43 expression after
a complete transection of the spinal cord of the rat as
evaluated by in situ hybridization (Lee et al. 2005). Unlike
the transient increase observed in turtles, Cx43 up-regulation
in the rat increases progressively up to 4 weeks (Lee et al.
2005). The role played by Cx43 in response to injury of the
nervous system is controversial, with some reports suggest-
ing that increased levels are detrimental (Frantseva et al.
2002a,b), whereas others claim that Cx43 down-regulation
results in an expansion in the lesion size (Siushansian et al.
2001; Nakase et al. 2004). The interference with Cx43
function after spinal cord injury reduces the reactive
astrogliosis and neuronal death (O’Carroll et al. 2008) and
improves functional recovery (Cronin et al. 2008). Our
findings suggest that in turtles, the rapid decline of the initial
up-regulation of Cx43 may minimize the detrimental effects
of Cx43 mentioned above, possibly by avoiding the spread of
injury.
It is not clear whether the increased expression of Cx43
reported here results in an increased number of hemichannels
or functional gap junctions. Hemichannels have been postu-
lated to mediate a component of ATP release (Garré et al.
2010) that acts on P2X7 channels during spinal cord injury
(Peng et al. 2009). A role for hemichannels in early stages of
spinal cord injury is suggested by the fact that low
concentrations of a Cx43 mimetic peptide reduce hemichan-
nel opening and prevent neuronal loss (O’Carroll et al.
2008).
The increased number of Cx43 punctae both in the white
and gray matter suggests that the enhancement of Cx43
mRNA in the turtle spinal cord may be accounted by reactive
astrocytes, as suggested by the increased expression of
GFAP close to the CC at 4 DPI (see Figure S5). Although it
is a reasonable assumption that Cx43 mRNA in CC-
contacting progenitors is increased, a lack of variation or
even a decreased expression in these cells could be masked
by the over-expression in astrocytes. Single cell RT-PCR
would be necessary to test whether CC-contacting progen-
itors react to injury by increasing Cx43 gene expression. In
addition, given the role of electrical coupling in regulating
the biology of progenitor cells (Duval et al. 2002; Bruzzone
and Dermietzel 2006), it will be also important to test
whether the changes in Cx43 mRNA match an increased
electrical and metabolic coupling among BLBP/Pax6 pro-
genitors.
The increased expression of BLBP seems to be an
evolutionary preserved reaction to spinal injury because it
is observed in salamanders (Monaghan et al. 2007), turtles
(Rehermann et al. 2009 and this study), and mammals
(White et al. 2010). In mammals, BLBP is not expressed in
ependymal cells under normal conditions, but is transiently
re-expressed after spinal cord injury (White et al. 2010). This
suggests that when challenged, some cells in the mammalian
ependyma are transformed into a phenotype of progenitors
observed in the normal cord of turtles (Russo et al. 2008).
BLBP expression in the ependyma of the mammalian cord
returns to control levels 7 days after injury (White et al.
2010), paralleling the time course of the increased BLBP

mRNA in the turtle spinal cord. In mammals, however, the
expression of BLBP continues in cells that co-express GFAP
in the spared white matter and the lesion border, suggesting
these cells are progenitors generating reactive astrocytes
(White et al. 2010). Although BLBP+/GFAP+ cells are
components of the cellular bridge that reconnects the severed
spinal cord in turtles, they do not form a scar but provide a
scaffold for regenerating axons (Rehermann et al. 2009).
Thus, although BLBP signaling in mammals and turtles seem
to share some common features, it is possible that the
expression of BLBP after injury in turtles is linked to more
adaptive mechanisms. The actual function of BLBP during
repair is still unknown. BLBP belongs to the family of fatty
acid binding proteins that regulate various metabolic pro-
cesses and ligand trafficking in the CNS (Feng et al. 1994;
Haunerland and Spener 2004). Interestingly, lipid turnover
has been associated with axonal growth and nerve regener-
ation (Vance et al. 2010).
Our immunocytochemical study showed a tissue cytoar-
chitecture within the spinal cord stumps resembling that of the
uninjured spinal cord, with BLBP+ progenitors still restricted
to the lateral aspects of the CC. However, after injury there
were BLBP+ cells at some distance from the CC raising the
possibility they may have detached from the main clusters of
progenitors. Themigration of ependymal cells to the injury site
has been shown in the spinal cord of rats (Mothe and Tator
2005) and mice (Meletis et al. 2008). However, the factors
driving the migration of these cells to the injured zone are not
clear. Reelin is up-regulated in the injured adult brain and has
been proposed to drive subventricular progenitor cells away
from the rostral migratory stream toward the lesion site
(Courtès et al. 2011). The stromal cell derived factor-1 has
been also proposed to attract ependymal cells and macro-
phages to the injury site (Tysseling et al. 2011). It remains to
be demonstrated whether BLBP progenitors respond to these
signals and migrate to the cellular bridge filling the gap
between stumps (Rehermann et al. 2009).
Unlike the other genes explored in this study, Pax6
expression did not change significantly after injury. This is
in striking contrast with the situation reported for the
mammalian spinal cord in which Pax6 is not expressed in
ependymal cells of the normal adult spinal cord but is
transiently expressed in vimentin+/nestin+ ependymal cells
after spinal cord injury (Yamamoto et al. 2001). The tran-
scription factor Pax6 has been shown to regulate the prolif-
eration of progenitors (Maekawa et al. 2005; Buffo 2007) and
is a key neurogenic determinant both during development and
in adult neurogenic niches (Kohwi et al. 2005; Bel-Vialar
et al. 2007). The fact that BLBP up-regulation is not paralleled
with an increase in Pax6 may imply that in the turtle, the
progenitors are biased to generate glial cells during the initial
stages of repair. This possibility is in line with our previous
studies showing that newly generated cells express glial but
not neuronal markers during spinal cord regeneration in the
turtle (Rehermann et al. 2009). In amphibians and fishes,
however, the mechanisms for endogenous repair include the
generation of new neurons (Benraiss et al. 1999; Reimer et al.
2008; Tanaka and Ferretti 2009). Thus, although turtles are
able to achieve some degree of functional regeneration after
spinal cord injury, the reaction of the cord in terms of the
generated cell lineages is more similar to mammals (Meletis
et al. 2008) than to other low vertebrates. It has been proposed
that the inability for neurogenesis after injury in the mamma-
lian cortex arise from the antagonism of the pro-neural factor
Pax6 by Olig2 (Buffo 2007). It remains to be explored the
contribution of other transcription factors to set the lineage
potential of progenitors after injury in the turtle spinal cord.
Hu expression exhibited a slight up-regulation 4 days after
injury to reach half its normal expression levels at 12, 20, and
60 days post injury. The Hu family of neuronal proteins (HuB,
HuC and HuD) exhibit a high degree of sequence homology
(Okano and Darnell 1997) playing important roles in neuronal
differentiation and plasticity by affecting post-transcriptional
aspects of RNA metabolism (Hinman and Lou 2008). For
example, over-expression of HuD increases the neurite
outgrowth (Anderson et al. 2000, 2001) and knockdown of
HuC results in impaired spatial learning in mice (Quattrone
et al. 2001). The increase in HuB mRNA after spinal cord
injury in turtles is because of up-regulation of gene expression
in pre-existent neurons because our previous studies did not
show evidence of neurogenesis induced by injury (Rehermann
et al. 2011). Because Hu proteins are important to stabilize
targetmRNAs, it is possible that the increasedHu transcription
is a homeostatic adjustment to spare neuronal elements
challenged by the insult. Although Hu proteins have been
shown to be transiently over-expressed after injury of periph-
eral nerves (Anderson et al. 2003), their role in healing is not
clear. The late reduction in Hu mRNA levels may reflect the
loss of neurons in the stumps. In mammals (Profyris et al.
2004) and in salamander (Monaghan et al. 2007), neuronal-
related genes also appeared down-regulated after injury. In the
rat, the decline in the expression of neural-specific transcripts
is accompanied by a significant rise in tissue repairing genes
that are remarkably similar to those acting in dermal wound
healing (Velardo et al. 2004).
The time course of the change in gene expression implies
that the genes selected in this study participate mostly of the
early response to injury. It is noteworthy that at this time, the
bridge linking the rostral and caudal stumps is not fully
developed yet, and from a functional point of view, motor
activity is only limited to segmental spinal reflex movements
as stepping patterns appear no less than 60 days after injury
(Rehermann et al. 2009). This implies that the endogenous
repair mechanisms involve a more complex set of genes
turning on and off at different stages of repair. Future studies
should explore the genes involved in later stages of
regeneration of the turtle spinal cord leading to some degree
of functional recovery.

Concluding, our study shows that molecular and bioinfor-
matics tools can be used to associate gene expression changes
with cellular and functional aspects of spinal cord regener-
ation. The high conservation degree found for the selected
genes in this study validates our biological model and
illustrates the utility of T. dorbignyi for identifying the genes
and gene functions that sustain the remarkable self-repair
mechanisms within the spinal cord of some vertebrates.
