1. Introduction
Traumatic spinal cord injury is a complex, progressive event
and the formation of cystic cavities (Sekhon and Fehlings,
2001). There is limited capacity of the human spinal cord to
repair itself, so there is a need for therapeutic strategies tolevel T10 in the athymic rat. Six weeks later the animals receiving the hOEC-derived
transplants had greater functional improvement in their hindlimbs than controls, assessed
using open field (BBB scale) and horizontal rung walking tests. Histological analysis
demonstrated beneficial effects of hOEC-derived cell transplantation: reductions in the
volume of the lesion and the cavities within the lesion. The transplanted cells were located
at the periphery of the lesion where they integrated with GFAP-positive astrocytes resulting
in a significant reduction of GFAP staining intensity adjacent to the lesion. Although their
mechanism of action is unclear we conclude that hOEC-derived cell transplants improved

Numerous reports indicate that rodent olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) assist in spinal
cord repair and clinical trials have been undertaken using autologous transplantation of
human olfactory ensheathing cells (hOECs) as a treatment for spinal cord injury. However,
there are few studies investigating the efficacy of hOECs in animal models of spinal cord
injury. In this study hOECs were derived from biopsies of human olfactory mucosa, purifed
by culture in a serum-free medium containing neurotrophin-3, genetically labelled withNational Centre for Adult Stem Cell R

Fairless and Barnett, 2005; Farbman and Squinto, 1985;
Ramon-Cueto and Valverde, 1995).
Many studies have demonstrated that OECs are therapeutic
when transplanted into the injured spinal cord in rodent
models including restoration of motor function (Keyvan-
Fouladi et al., 2003; Kubasak et al., 2008; Li et al., 2003; Li et
al., 1997; Lopez-Vales et al., 2007), improvement of respiratory
function (Li et al., 2003) and restoration of bladder function
(Pascual et al., 2002). Transplanted OECs induced axon
regeneration (Keyvan-Fouladi et al., 2003; Li et al., 1997, 1998,
2007; Lopez-Vales et al., 2007; Plant et al., 2003; Ramon-Cueto
et al., 1998), remyelination of axons (Barnett et al., 2000;
Imaizumi et al., 1998; Kato et al., 2000), reduced lesion size,
cystic cavitation and astrocytic gliosis (Lopez-Vales et al., 2006;
Ramer et al., 2004; Takami et al., 2002; Verdu et al., 2001) and
ameliorated electrical conduction through the injury site
(Imaizumi et al., 1998, 2000; Lopez-Vales et al., 2006, 2007;
Toft et al., 2007).
Most previous studies have investigated the therapeutic
properties of rat OECs although human OECs remyelinated
spinal cord axons after demyelinating lesions (Barnett et al.,
2000; Kato et al., 2000) and primate OECs induced locomotor
recovery after transection injury in the rat (Guest et al., 2008).
There are no previous studies of human OEC transplantation
into the contused rat spinal cord, a model of injury that
mimics aspects of many common human injuries. Most
previous studies, including the human and primate reports,
obtained OECs from the olfactory bulbs within the cranial
cavity. This is not a clinically favoured site for sourcing
autologous OECs because of the morbidity associated with
surgical access and destruction of the olfactory bulbs to obtain
the cells. OECs can be obtained from the olfactory mucosa in
the nose (Bianco et al., 2004) and OECs from this source were
therapeutic when transplanted into the transected spinal cord
in rat (Lu et al., 2001, 2002). hOECs derived from the olfactory
mucosa were similar to rat nasal OECs in proliferation,
survival and migration after transplantation into the normal
spinal cord of athymic rats (Deng et al., 2006). For autologous
transplants, OECs are relatively easy to obtain from the
human nose by biopsy of the olfactory mucosa, without
affecting olfactory function (Feron et al., 1998). A Phase I
clinical trial demonstrated that transplantation of autologous
OECs was safe in human paraplegia (Feron et al., 2005;
Mackay-Sim et al., 2008).
The aim of this study was to establish whether OECs
obtained from the human mucosa and genetically labelled
with green fluorescent protein are able to produce similar
behavioural outcomes to that reported for rat OECs. While the
remyelination potential of human bulbar OECs has been
documented, this is the first time locomotor improvements
following human mucosal OEC transplants have been inves-
tigated. We used the traumatic contusion model (MASCIS
impactor) which results in a complex central lesion with
damage to spinal cord tissue and blood vessels, and ongoing
secondary injury and cyst formation (Basso et al., 1996) similar
to human spinal injury (Sekhon and Fehlings, 2001). The use of
B R A I N R E S E A R Cathymic rats (Rolstad, 2001) limits xenograft rejection of the
hOECs, and delaying transplantation until a week after injuryum injection there was an increase in BBB scores for both
groups (Fig. 1A) with a significantly greater improvement in
the hOEC transplant group, (two way ANOVA repeatedreduces exposure of the grafted cells to the acute inflamma-
tory phase.
2. Results
2.1. Sample
Twenty animals (9 receiving hOECs and 11 controls) were used
in the final analysis. Three animals were excluded from the
study because the compression rate during spinal cord
contusion and/or the initial BBB score was more than two
standard deviations from the groupmean and one animal was
excluded due to post-operative complications. The mean
compression rate for the hOEC transplanted group was 0.36±
0.02 m/s compared to 0.38±0.04 m/s for the control group.
There was no difference between the groups (t=0.658, df 18,
p=0.52). The lesion locations were comparable for the
transplanted and non-transplanted group lesions. The posi-
tioning of the impactor head between the T9 and T11
vertebrate prevents much variation in lesion location between
animals. There was a small decrease in body weight (<10%) in
the first week after the surgery that then increased during the
6-week post-contusion period to above baseline levels. All rats
were spontaneously voiding urine by 2 weeks post-contusion
surgery. The cell transplantation procedure 1 week after
spinal cord contusion did not cause any noticeable adverse
effects. Despite obvious locomotor deficits, all animals were
alert, healthy and mobile after surgery.
2.2. Phenotyping of cells
Prior to transduction with pFB-hrGFP, cells were identified
immunocytochemically with antibodies against glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP; Dako, Denmark), S100 (Dako, Denmark),
p75NTR (Neubody, AUS) and R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-
HNK1 (Sigma). The percentages of S100-positive and GFAP
positive cells were >95%, nearly all cells were also p75 NTR
immunoreactive and there was no staining of NHK 1 antibody
(Feron et al., 2005) indicating the culture was highly enriched
for OEC. However immunophenotyping of these cells just prior
to transplantation showed no expression of any of these
markers. For reasons addressed in Discussion, we consider the
most likely explanation for this loss of expression is due to
plasticity of the OECs which is well known to occur in vitro
(Barnett et al., 2000; Vincent et al., 2003, 2005; Moreno-Flores et
al., 2003), rather than replacement of all the OECs by another
immunonegative cell type. We therefore have used the term
hOECs to describe these transplants, but acknowledge their
identity is unconfirmed.

consecutive steps completed after the rat had stabilised itself

2.4. Histological analysis
2.4.1. Lesion size
This moderate contusion resulted in a typical “oval” shaped
injury with a large centrally located lesion containing necrotic
tissue, cellular debris, macrophages, cystic cavities and
trabeculae of tissue (Fig. 2A–E). Surrounding the lesion there
was relative sparing of tissue but extensive diffuse axonal
injury in the white matter. The terminal bulbs of axons were
identifiable by their smooth rounded appearance and eosin-
ophilic staining in H&E stained sections (Fig. 2C), and were
clearly identified in the peripheral white matter with NF-200
staining (Fig. 5D). Spinal cords with hOEC transplants had
smaller lesions with less cavitation (Fig. 2B, E). The overall
percentage of lesion area was significantly less for the hOEC
transplanted spinal cords (37.2±6.6%) compared to the con-
trols (51.04±5.4%), (t=5.1, df 18, p<0.001). The dorsal part of the
cord sustained the most injury and there was no difference in
severity for hOEC transplanted animals and controls at this
level. At each of the middle levels through the cord the hOEC
transplanted animals showed consistently smaller lesionsizes (Fig. 3A). Within the lesion, the overall percentage of
cavity area was significantly reduced for hOEC groups (3.1±
2.7%) compared to the controls (15.5±15.3%), (t=2.2, df 18,
p=0.038). Cavitation was highest in the middle sections of the
spinal cord for both groups, with the controls showing
significantly greater cavitation than hOEC transplanted ani-
mals at the central level (Fig. 3B). The highest percentage of
spared tissue was seen toward the ventral part of the spinal
cord for both groups, however overall there was differential
sparing in the hOEC-transplanted animals (35±6.24%) com-
pared to the controls (25.9±1.1 %), (t=-2.1, df 18, p=0.054), most
apparent in the central and ventral parts of the cord (Fig. 3C).
2.4.2. hOEC survival
Six weeks after transplantation into the lesion site the hOECs
were clearly visible within the lesion (Fig. 4A), aligned in a

of the lesion both at the lateral white matter border and near
the rostral and caudal grey matter. Except for a few individual
cells (Fig. 4C) hOECs did not migrate from the lesion into
surrounding spinal cord tissue.
2.4.3. Immunohistochemistry
Six weeks after transplantation, GFAP staining intensity was
increased immediately adjacent to the lesion in controls
(Fig. 5A) and to a lesser extent in hOEC transplanted spinal
cords (Fig. 5B). Quantification of the GFAP staining intensity
showed an overall 17% reduction in GFAP intensity in hOEC
transplanted rats. The control animals showed a 27±9.5%
increase in GFAP staining intensity adjacent to the lesion
compared to an increase of 10±6.6 % in the hOEC transplanted
animals (t=4.5, df 18, p=0.001). This pattern was consistent
throughout the spinal cord, and all but the ventral section
showed significant differences (Fig. 3D). High power exami-
nation at the edge of the lesion showed close association
between some hOECs and GFAP positive astrocytes at the
host-graft interface (Fig. 5C). Occasional single hOECs were
seen migrating short distances towards the white matter, and
astrocytic processes were seen extending towards the centre
H 1B R A I N R E S E A R Cof the lesion. GFAP staining was also seen in trabeculae of
tissue fragments within the lesion centre.
NF200 staining identified large axons and terminal bulbs in
the white matter adjacent to the lesion (Fig. 5D). hOECs were
located in close proximity to axons at the caudal and rostral
ends of the lesion but few of these axons continued into the
epicentre. The hOECs appeared to be aligned in the same
direction as axons and confocal examination confirmed a
close association between some hOECs and NF200-positive
axons (Fig. 5E) but it was not possible to determine if hOECs
were enwrapping axons.
High numbers of large autofluorescent cells with macro-
phage morphology were evident in the lesion centre of hOEC
transplanted (Fig. 4A, D–F) and control spinal cords. Staining
with ED1, a specific marker for rat myeloid cells, confirmed
these were macrophages or microglia (Fig. 5F, G) and

3. Discussion
In this study we show that hOEC-derived cells from the
olfactory mucosa induced significant locomotor and histolog-
ical improvements after transplantation into the contused
spinal cord of the rat. Compared to controls the hOEC
transplanted animals had significantly better hindlimb loco-
motor function in the open field test, fewer stepping errors in
the horizontal ladder task, reduced spinal cord lesion volume
and reduced cavitation within the lesion. There was also
evidence for reduced astrogliosis at the lesion site.

3.1. Human OECs from olfactory mucosa
The cells used in this study are derived from the human
olfactory mucosa. OEC cultures from this source are poten-
tially contaminated by Schwann cells associated with the
trigeminal nerve whose branches innervate olfactory epithe-
lium and olfactory bulb (Schaefer et al., 2002), or other cell
types located in the olfactory mucosa, including precursor
cells and stem cells (Lindsay et al., 2010). A comprehensive
review article by Kawaja et al. (2009) describes the technical
challenges in isolating, purifying and phenotyping OECs from
olfactory bulb and mucosal tissue cultures. Several antigenic
markers, including calponin and smooth muscle actin, have
been reported to identify OECs but not Schwann cells (Boyd et
al., 2006; Jahed et al., 2007) but these have not been verified
independently and at present there is no method to unequiv-
ocally distinguish between OECs and Schwann cells in vitro
We used a serum-free medium containing NT3 to selectively
propagate OECs (Bianco et al., 2004). This medium does not
support long-term culture of Schwann cells (Cheng et al., 1998)
although NT3 supports survival of 50% Schwann cells in the
12 B R A I N R E S E A R C H 1 3 3 7 ( 2 0 1 0 ) 8 – 2 0first 3 h of culture (Meier et al., 1999) and 20-30% in the first
24 h (Lobsiger et al., 2000). Furthermore, no cells stained
positive for HNK 1, a marker that recognises humanmyelinat-
ing Schwann cells (Levi et al., 1994). Throughout our paper we
have referred to the transplanted cells as hOECs and while we
consider these cell preparations to be highly enriched for OECs
it is possible that the transplants contain other, as yet
unidentified, cell types from the olfactory mucosa. The loss
of expression of GFAP, S100 and P75 in these cells during their
preparation (EGFP labelling, frozen storage and subsequent
revival and expansion) is amatter of concern and one that will
be further investigated by phenotyping cells at each step of
their preparation using a more comprehensive panel of
antibodies (Lim et al., 2010; Garcia-Escudero, et al., 2010).
Previously, hOECs grown under the same NT3 culture condi-
tions, but without the subsequent labelling and storage steps
maintained their GFAP+, S100+, p75-NGF+phenotype (Feron et
al., 2005). OECs are very plastic in vitro and the expression of
markers varies with culture conditions (Barnett et al., 2000;
Vincent et al., 2003, 2005) and species (Bock et al., 2007;
Smithson and Kawaja, 2009). p75-NGF can be reduced
following incubation in 10% fetal calf serum without loss of
regenerative capacity (Moreno-Flores et al., 2003). It is possible
that the hOECs have lost their immunological phenotype due
to the particular protocol we used. The less likely possibility
also exists that OECs (and Schwann cells) are completely
absent from the cell culture immediately prior to transplan-
tation, and it is made up entirely of a different cell population.
A recent review (Lindsay et al., 2010) outlines the complexity
and heterogenicity of cells located in the human olfactory
mucosa. If this is the case here it is critical to identify these
cells as we have demonstrated their potential for improving
function after spinal cord injury.

H 1B R A I N R E S E A R CClinical application of OECs requires an accessible source of
these cells. In themajority of experiments OECswere obtained
from the rodent olfactory bulb and amethod has been devised
for unilateral bulbectomy through the frontal bone in primate
(Rubio et al., 2008). OECs have been obtained from post-
mortem brain (Barnett et al., 2000) but a clinically preferable
source is the olfactory mucosa, accessible through the
external naris (Feron et al., 1998; Bianco et al., 2004) because
there is little morbidity and it allows autologous transplanta-
tion (Feron et al., 2005;Mackay-Sim et al., 2008). This is the first
study in which hOECs were transplanted into the contusion
model of spinal cord injury and the results showmoremarked
post-transplantation improvements in hindlimb locomotion
compared to rodent OEC transplantation in similar models
(Barakat et al., 2005; Pearse et al., 2004; Takami et al., 2002).
This raises the possibility that hOECs may be subtly different
from rodent OECs as indicated by recent in vitro studies of
rodent, canine, primate and human OECs which show
interspecies differences in proliferation and responses to
growth factors (Barnett et al., 2000; Krudewig et al., 2006;
Rubio et al., 2008). Another source of variation between studies
might be the differentmethods of cell culture used in different
laboratories.

transplantation into the spinal cord. The use of genetic
reporter GFP provides unequivocal visualisation after trans-
plantation (Guest et al., 2008; Pearse et al., 2007; Sasaki et al.,
2007) and hOECs survived for 6 weeks in our study. The timing
of hOEC transplantation in this study was delayed until 7 days
after contusion injury because this had been reported to be
more effective than transplantation at the time of injury (Plant
et al., 2003). The toxicity of the lesion site to transplanted OECs
was demonstrated by differences in the survival rate: 69% at
3 days to less than 5% by 3–9 weeks after transplantation into
the epicentre of a contusion lesion compared to a 60% survival
rate when transplanted away from the lesion (Pearse et al.,
2007). In vitro experiments further demonstrate that apoptosis
of OECs was significantly increased when co-cultured with
acutely injured spinal cord explants compared to delayed
injury explants (Woodhouse et al., 2005).

task (Metz and Whishaw, 2002) compared to the open field
assessment (Basso et al., 1995).
Interestingly there was differential sparing of tissue for the
hOEC transplanted animals compared to the controls partic-
ularly in the central to ventral parts of the cord. In the rat,
descending spinal tracts located in this region include the
medullary and pontine reticulospinal tracts, the medial and
lateral vestibulospinal tracts and raphespinal fibres projecting
from the raphe obscurus and pallidus nuclei (Watson et al.,
2009). These tracts are involved in themaintenance of posture
and balance during walking and the initiation and mainte-
nance of locomotion (Fouad and Pearson, 2004). Plasticity or
regeneration of these fibre tracts has been reported to improve
functional hindlimb recovery following spinal lesions (Baller-
mann and Fouad, 2006; Ito et al., 1999; Lopez-Vales et al., 2007;
Lu et al., 2002; Boido et al., 2009).While the dorsal columns and
dorsolateral tissue containing the corticospinal and rubrosp-
inal tracts appear to bemarkedly damaged in our injurymodel,
the transplanted hOECs may be promoting survival or
plasticity of axons in the lateral, ventrolateral and ventral
parts of the cord, leading to the locomotor improvements seen.
3.3. hOECs reduced histological measures of injury
compared to controls
We have shown that hOECs from olfactory mucosa reduce
lesion size and cavity area within the lesion. This is consistent
with findings after transplantation of mouse mucosal OECs
into a rat dorsolateral spinal cord injury (Ramer et al., 2004),
and rat olfactory bulb OECs in a moderate contusion lesion
(Plant et al., 2003; Takami et al., 2002), but not in other studies
of rat olfactory bulb OECs transplanted into contusions
(Barakat et al., 2005; Pearse et al., 2007). In the present study,
the hOEC graft appeared continuouswith the host tissuewhen
stained with H&E, in agreement with the findings of Takami
et al. (2002). However fluorescence immunochemistry dem-
onstrated that cavity-filling cellswereheterogeneous,with the
hOECs congregated at the periphery of the lesion as described
by others (Barakat et al., 2005; Pearse et al., 2007). The presence
of hOEC at the edge of the lesion was associated with reduc-
tions in GFAP intensity adjacent to the lesion indicating that
hOECs have ameliorated the injury-induced astrogliosis. In co-
culture with astrocytes OECs reduce astrogliosis in a “wound
injury” model (O'Toole et al., 2007).
A previous study reported histological and behavioural
recovery after OEC transplantation into the contusion injury of
the spinal cord (Plant et al., 2003). That study used OECs
obtained from the adult rat olfactory bulb, with similar
histological recovery as shown here for hOECs from the
olfactory mucosa. Plant et al. (2003) also observed improved
locomotor ability and demonstrated significant axonal spar-
ing/regenerationwhen OECswere transplanted into the lesion
site 7 days after the contusion.
Demonstration of efficacy in contusion injuries is an
B R A I N R E S E A R Cimportant pre-clinical outcome because contusions are the
most common type of human injury and all other studies ofmigrated into the surrounding parenchyma to remyelinate
descending or ascending axons nor there was there evidence
for axons coursing through the lesion/transplant site. We
conclude that the hOECs may have been neuroprotective,
probably mediated by growth factors and cytokines released
into the surrounding tissues. OECs secrete soluble factors,
including neurotrophins, that promote neurite sprouting in
vitro and in the injured spinal cord (Chuah et al., 2004; Chung
et al., 2004; Woodhouse et al., 2005). Many studies have
demonstrated the regenerative and anti-apoptotic effects of
neurotrophic factors in spinal cord repair (Bregman et al.,
2002; Jin et al., 2002; Lo et al., 2008; Vavrek et al., 2006). Recent
gene expression analyses have shown that OECs also express
a large range of genes involved in wound repair, extracellular
matrix formation, cell adhesion (Franssen et al., 2008; Kafitz
and Greer, 1998; Vincent et al., 2005) and inflammatory
responses (Vincent et al., 2005).
The reduction of astrogliosis in the hOEC transplanted
animals suggests another potential mechanism of action,
namely, modulation of the inflammation in the spinal cord.
Inflammation is an important process that removes cellular
debris after injury but, when left unresolved, activated
neutrophils and macrophages/microglia can continue to
release toxic cytokines and destroy healthy tissue, leading to
spreading secondary damage. This is a major problem
following spinal cord injury (Fitch et al., 1999). The reduction
of astrocytes at the lesion site is consistent with a reduced
inflammatory response to the injury but the issue requires a
deeper analysis of inflammatory cells and molecules. For
example, there was no obvious difference in macrophage/
microglia density at the lesion in the present study but a time-
course analysis would better reveal dynamic changes during
the early stages and wound and repair responses. Lopez-Vales
et al. (2004) has reported an earlier higher recruitment of
microglia/macrophages by rat OEC within in the first 2 weeks
post-injury compared to DMEM injected animals, with signif-
icant improvements in function and tissue sparing.
4. Experimental procedures
4.1. Biopsy and cell culture of human OECs
Olfactory mucosa was obtained by biopsy from human
volunteers during routine nasal surgery (septoplasty or
turbinectomy) under general anesthesia (Feron et al., 1998).
All biopsies were obtained with informed consent using a
protocol approved by the human ethics committees ofOEC transplantation have used either small discrete spinal
cord lesions or complete spinal cord transections (Guest et al.,
2008; Keyvan-Fouladi et al., 2003; Li et al., 1997; Lopez-Vales et
al., 2007; Lu et al., 2002).
3.4. Mechanism of hOEC action
We demonstrate here significant improvements in functional
and histological outcomes after transplantation of hOECs into
153 3 7 ( 2 0 1 0 ) 8 – 2 0Griffith University and the Brisbane Private Hospital, Bris-
bane, Australia, in accordance with the guidelines of the
H 1National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.
The biopsies, from the posterior septum close to the cribiform
plate, were placed immediately on ice in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium/Ham F12 (DMEM/F12; JRH) and hOECs were
cultured as described (Bianco et al., 2004). Briefly, the biopsied
tissuewas incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in Dispase II (2.4 U/ml
in Puck's solution; Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), after
which the lamina propria was separated from the epithelium
with a microspatula and washed in Hank's balanced salt
solution (HBSS; JRH). The lamina propria was then cut into
smaller 40 μm pieces using a McIlwain tissue chopper
(Brinkman Instruments, Inc., Westbury, New York) and
incubated in collagenase (0.25%; type I; Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) in DMEM/F12 for 10 min at 37 °C. The tissue was
mechanically dissociated into single cells by trituration and
then washed in HBSS. The cells were pelleted by centrifuga-
tion and resuspended in DMEM/F12 supplemented with
foetal calf serum (FCS, 10%) and plated into poly-L-lysine-
coated tissue culture flasks (1 µg/cm2; Sigma). Cells were
grown in this medium at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 48 h, after which
the medium was changed to DMEM/F12 supplemented with
neurotrophin-3 (50 ng/ml; Alamone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), a
process that enhances OEC proliferation (Bianco et al., 2004).
To create a cell line that overexpresses human recombinant
green fluorescent protein (hrGFP), cells were transduced with
the pFB-hrGFP retroviral supernatant (Stratagene, Catalogue
#972002) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluo-
rescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was then performed to
isolate a near >99% pure population of cells expressing
hrGFP. After FACS, cultures were grown to approximately 80-
90% confluence and harvested for cyropreservation by
incubation in Trypsin-EDTA (0.25% Trypsin, 1 mM EDTA;
JRH) solution for 5 min at 37 °C/5% CO2 followed by centrifu-
gation to pelletise the cells. The cell pellet was then re-
suspended in cryo-storage medium comprising of 90% FCS
and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 4 °C. Aliquots of cell
suspension (0.5 ml each) were dispensed into cryotubes
(Nunc) and placed immediately on ice before being placed
in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. To revive cryopre-
served cells, cryotubes were removed from liquid nitrogen
and placed immediately into a 37 °C water bath to thaw after
which 1 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) DMEM/F12 + 10% FCS was
added drop-wise to a final volume of 1.5 ml. The cell
suspension was then transferred slowly into 10 ml of pre-
warmed DMEM/F12+10% FCS and centrifuged at 200g for
10 min. The pellet was re-suspended in DMEM/F12+10% FCS
and cultured as previously described prior to use in trans-
plantation experiments. hOEC cultures were transported to
the University of New South Wales on the day prior to the
experiment by courier at ambient temperature. Prior to
transplantation cells were harvested, counted using the
vital dye Trypan Blue, and re-suspended at a concentration
of 15×104 cells/µl in DMEM/F12+10% FCS.
4.2. Animals
24 inbred athymic rats (CBH-rnu/Arc, female, 8–9 weeks old)
were obtained from the Animal Resources Centre (Perth,
16 B R A I N R E S E A R CAustralia). They were housed in sterilized cages equipped
with an air filter and sterile beddingmaterials andmaintainedon 12:12-h light–dark cycle, with free access to sterilized water
and irradiated food throughout the experiment. All animal
procedures were performedwith approval from the University
of New South Wales Animal Care and Ethics Committee.
4.3. Spinal cord injury
Rats were anesthetized with ketamine:xylazine (100:10 mg/kg,
IP) and placed on a homeothermic blanket (body temperature
maintained at 37 °C±1 °C). An incision was made in the dorsal
midline skin from the mid to the low thoracic region and
subsequent layers of connective tissue and muscle were
separated to expose the spinal column. A bilateral laminect-
omy was performed on the T10 vertebrae. Animals were
subjected to a moderate contusion injury using the MASCIS
weight drop device developed at New York University
(12.5 mm, 10 g,). The impact height, velocity and compression
were recorded and the compression rate calculated. Rats were
excluded from the study if they had a compression rate more
than two standard deviations from the group mean. The
muscles and the skin were sutured closed in layers. Post-
operatively animals were given antibiotics (cephalothin sodi-
um 100 mg/mL, 0.1 ml), analgesics (carprofen 50 mg/mL,
0.01 ml) and supplementary fluid (Hartman's replacement
solution 2 ml) twice daily for 3 days. Bladders were expressed
manually until the normal voiding response returned. Anti-
biotics were continued until the urine was clear.
4.4. hOEC transplantation
One week after the spinal cord contusion injury, animals were
re-anesthetized as above and the T10 lesion site re-exposed.
The vertebral column was stabilized using clamps to the
T9 and T11 spinous process and a 5-μl syringe (26G, SGE,
Australia) attached to a micromanipulater was used to inject
hOECs in solution into the spinal cord lesion. A total of 1×106
hOECs were suspended in 7 μl of DMEM/F12 + 10% FCS. 5 µl of
hOEC solution was injected into the centre of the lesion over
5 min. 1 µl was injected 1 mm rostral and 1 µl was injected
1 mm caudal on the midline at a depth of 0.5 mm. Control
animals received the same volume of culture media, but
without cells, injected into the same sites. After injection,
syringes were held in place for a further 3 min to reduce
leakage on removal.
4.5. Behavioural assessments
Each animal was familiarised with the open field apparatus
and pre-trained on the horizontal ladder prior to surgery.
Following the spinal cord contusion the animals were
assessed in the open field apparatus at day 1 post-contusion
and then weekly for 6 weeks. Animals were also tested on the
horizontal ladder at 6 weeks post-contusion. All sessions were
recorded using digital cameras linked to a FileMaker Pro
database (FileMaker Pro 7.0 v3, FileMaker Inc, 1984–2007, Ca)
for 2 min (open field) or for three passes of the horizontal
ladder. Scoring was conducted by 2 independent observers
blinded as to the treatment group using the digital recordings
3 3 7 ( 2 0 1 0 ) 8 – 2 0which could be analysed frame by frame when necessary.
Averaged scores were used as the final score for each trial.
H 14.5.1. Open field assessments
The BBB rating scale (Basso et al., 1995) was used for open field
assessments. Briefly, this rating scale assesses hindlimb
movement on a 21-point scale while animals move freely
within a 90-cm diameter open field. The BBB rating scale
incorporates ankle, knee and hip movements initially, then
weight support and plantar stepping, and finally coordinated
limb movements, paw rotation and trunk stability. Animals
were assessed on the first day after contusion surgery to test
for consistency of the lesion and thereafter assessed weekly.
Animalswere excluded from the study if their BBB score at day
1 was greater than two standard deviations from the group
mean.
4.5.2. Horizontal ladder rung walking test
For a more challenging assessment of hindlimb function rats
were also tested on ahorizontal ladder rungwalking apparatus
using the methods described by Metz and Whishaw (2002).
Two 100-cm perspex sheets constituted the side walls of the
apparatus which were separated by 10 cm and connected at
their bases by a series of 3 mmmetal rungs set in an irregular
pattern. The ladder was elevated to a height of 20 cm above a
mirror angled at 45° to provide a ventral view of the hindlimbs.
A dark home cage was suspended at the end of the ladder to
encourage locomotion. Performance was scored using a 7-
category scale. For each step the foot placement on the rung
was rated according to its position and placement accuracy;
(0) Total miss, (1) Deep slip, (2) Slight slip, (3) Replacement,
(4) Correction, (5) Partial placement and (6) Correct placement.
Scores of 0, 1 or 2 were considered ‘errors”, i.e. an error
represented a totalmiss or any typeof foot slip. Thepercentage
of steps with errors was calculated for each animal during 3
passes of the apparatus and averaged for the group.
4.6. Histological analysis
SixweeksafterhOEC transplantationeachanimalwas injected
with sodium pentobarbitone (Lethobarb; 0.15 ml/100 g, IP) and
perfused transcardially with physiological saline, followed by
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). A
segment of spinal cord extending 5 mm rostral and caudal to
the injury site was collected. The tissue was post fixed in the
same fixative for 2 h and then cryoprotected in a solution of
30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with 0.01 % sodium
azideuntil sectioning. Sectionswere cut at a thickness of 30 µm
from the dorsal to ventral surface of the spinal cord (approx
1.8 mm in total depth). All the sections were mounted on a
series of 10 so that adjacent sections were on consecutive
slides. Each slide therefore contained 6–7 sections of spinal
cord at 300-µm intervals from the dorsal to ventral surface. For
each animal, spinal cord sections were aligned anatomically
using the central canal and each cord was assessed using 5
dorsal to ventral sections. For some animals the very dorsal
and/or the very ventral sections were not complete so these
were excluded from the analysis. One slide was stained with
haematoxylin and eosin (H&E); one was mounted in Fluro-
mount (Dako) for examination of hOECs expressing GFP. Three
other slides were used for immunohistochemistry for GFAP,
B R A I N R E S E A R CNF200 andED1. Sectionswere incubated in phosphate buffered
saline with triton-X (PBST) for 10 min and in 5% normal goatserum for 30 min before overnight incubation in primary
antibody at 4 °C; Rabbit anti-GFAP (1/1000, Dako, Denmark),
Mouse anti-Neurofilament 200 (1/1000, Sigma, MO) and Rabbit
anti-ED1 (1/2000, AbD Serotec, UK). Sections were rinsed in 3
changes of PBST before incubation in either AF 568-conjugated
Goat anti-mouse IgG (1/200, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, CA),
or TRITC-conjugated Swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1/200,
Dako, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. All sectionswere
counterstainedwithHoechst (33342, Invitrogen, CA) for 10 min
to visualize the cell nuclei. Sections were then rinsed in 3
changes of PBST and cover slipped using Fluromount mount-
ing media (Dako, Denmark).
4.6.1. Lesion size
Low-power digital images of the H&E stained sections (Fig. 2)
were used for injury quantification. Each sectionwas captured
using a PixelLink video camera mounted on an Olympus BH-2
microscope. One observer blind as to the group made all the
measurements using Image J analysis software (Rasband,
1997–2009).
The following measurements were made on each horizon-
tal section: the spinal cord area, measured in a 5 mm length of
tissue centred on the epicenter of the lesion (thick dashed
lines in Fig. 2) and the lesion area, defined by the area of
extensive tissue disruption, loss of neurons, and a rim of pale
staining tissue (thin dashed lines in Fig. 2). High power
microscopy was used to verify tissue injury; cavity areas
within the lesion, which were non-cellular areas selected by
grey scale intensity using Image J software. Also measured
was the width of the spinal cord at a line drawn perpendicular
to the midline at the epicenter of the lesion and the width of
spared tissue on the same line as above, with the left and right
sides summed.
Measurements were expressed as the percentage of lesion
area in the spinal cord area, the percentage of cavity area in
the lesion area, and the percentage of spared tissue in the
width of the spinal cord.
4.6.2. Immunohistochemistry
hOECs exhibited strong green fluorescence. All other immu-
nohistochemistry was carried out using red fluorescent
secondary antibodies. GFAP staining intensity was measured
as a mean grey scale value using NIH Image. The increase in
GFAP intensity adjacent to the lesion was calculated from the
mean grayscale value of GFAP staining adjacent to the lesion
divided by the mean grayscale value of GFAP staining 5 mm
distal to the lesion. The percentage increase in GFAP intensity
in each spinal cord was averaged for each group at each level
of spinal cord tissue. Sections of uninjured spinal cord showed
no differences in GFAP staining intensity across the section
using this method. Primary antibody was omitted for negative
controls. Sections stained with NF200 were examined using
confocal microscopy to determine if hOECs were co-localised
with NF 200 positive axon profiles. Antibodies against ED1
were used to confirm macrophage/microglia infiltration.
