AbstrAct  
Secondary damage is a critical determinant of the 
functional outcome in patients with spinal cord injury 
(SCI), and involves multiple mechanisms of which 
the most important is the loss of nerve cells mediated 
by multiple factors. Autophagy can result in cell 
death, and plays a key role in the development of 
SCI. It has been recognized that valproic acid (VPA) 
is neuroprotective in certain experimental animal 
models, however, the levels of autophagic changes 
in the process of neuroprotection by VPA treatment 
following SCI are still unknown. In the present study, 
we determined the extent of autophagy after VPA 
treatment in a rat model of SCI. We found that both 
the mRNA and protein levels of Beclin-1 and LC3 
were significantly increased at 1, 2, and 6 h after SCI 
and peaked at 2 h; however, Western blot showed that 
autophagy was markedly decreased by VPA treatment 
at 2 h post-injury. Besides, post-SCI treatment with 
VPA improved the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, 
increased the number of ventral horn motoneurons, 
and reduced myelin sheath damage compared 
with vehicle-treated animals at 42 days after SCI. 
Together, our results demonstrated the characteristics 
of autophagy expression following SCI, and found 
that VPA reduced autophagy and enhanced motor 
function.

INtrODUctION
Currently, trauma is the leading cause of mortality in the 
young population[1]. Trauma-induced spinal cord injury 
(SCI) drastically impinges on the quality of life in survivors 
who have residual disability, and causes a healthcare 
burden nationally[2,3]. In China, the incidence of SCI 
caused by car crashes, construction and mining accidents 
has increased ten-fold in the past decade[4]. Injury to the 
spinal cord causes primary and secondary damage. The 
secondary damage is often more important in determining 
the functional outcome and provides a practical target for 
therapeutic intervention. Although the secondary injury 
can be regulated, the mechanism is complex[4], and clinical 
treatment for SCI, especially for recovery of motor function, 
is not satisfactory[5]. Therefore, it is urgent to further 
understand the mechanisms underlying the development 
of SCI and to seek better and more efficient treatments to 
improve the quality of life of patients.
The post-traumatic systemic stress response is 
Hai-Hu Hao, et al.    VPA reduces autophagy and promotes functional recovery after SCI in rats 485
implicated in the functional loss after SCI[5,6]. The integrated 
stress response[7] plays a pivotal role in maintaining 
homeostasis in the body. Autophagy, a central component 
of this response[7], is influential in the development and 
progression of damage after injury[8-10]. Autophagy is an 
intracellular degradation system that delivers proteins and 
organelles to lysosomes for degradation[11]. It is involved in 
the development of many diseases[12,13], but both excessive 
and deficient autophagy are linked to pathophysiological 
events[14]. Recent studies confirmed that autophagy 
promotes secondary cell death in traumatic SCI[10,15,16] and 
affects functional recovery[17]. Therefore, we hypothesized 
that secondary injury can be controlled and functional 
outcome can be improved by the interruption of autophagy 
to some extent after SCI.
In many animal models, histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
inhibitors have neuroprotective effects in various neurological 
conditions[18-20]. Valproic acid (VPA) is an HDAC inhibitor, 
and plays a key role in fundamental cellular activities 
such as gene transcription[21]. A recent study in glioma 
cell lines demonstrated that VPA induces autophagy[22]. 
Therefore, the level of autophagy in spinal cord tissue may 
be influenced and motor function may be improved by VPA 
after SCI.
In this study, we used a rat model of SCI to investigate 
the characteristics of autophagy after SCI as well as the 
effect of VPA treatment on autophagy. In addition, we 
assessed the neuroprotective effect of VPA in acute SCI.

Animals
Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, 220–250 g, were 
purchased from the Animal Center of Shanxi Medical 
University, China. The animals were housed under light-
controlled conditions (12/12 h light/dark cycle) at 24°C, with 
food and water ad libitum. 
All procedures and experimental manipulations 
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee of Shanxi Medical University and were in accord 
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 
(NIH publication No. 85-23, revised 1996), and the Guide 
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals according to 
the regulation in the People's Republic of China.
spinal cord contusion Injury
Animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (0.3 
mL/100 g, i.p.), and SCI was induced using a modified 
New York University impactor[18,23,24]. In brief, the T10 
segment was exposed by laminectomy. Contusion injury 
was induced by dropping a 10-g rod (tip diameter, 2.5 mm) 
from a height of 25 mm onto the exposed cord. The sham-
operated animals received only a laminectomy to expose 
the cord, but were not subjected to impact injury. Manual 
bladder expression was performed on each animal twice 
daily until the recovery of sphincter control. 
VPA treatment
Rats randomly received VPA (300 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily) 
or an equal volume of saline vehicle for two weeks, starting 
immediately after the injury, as reported previously[21,25]. A 
group of sham-operated rats was included as an additional 
control.
Western blot 
At different time points (1, 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h) after 
SCI or immediately after the sham operation, the animals 
were anesthetized and the spinal cord tissue containing 
the injury epicenter were dissected out, and lysed in 
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Beyotime Biotech, 
China). Protein concentration was determined by a BCA 
protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL; 23228) 
and 40 μg protein was resolved on a 12% sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed (80 V for 30 
min followed by 120 V for 90 min), and transferred to a 
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Whatman, Clifton, 
NJ; 10485289). The membrane was blocked with 0.3% 
gelatin (A9418; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 2 h at 
room temperature, and then incubated with mouse anti-
Beclin-1 monoclonal (dilution, 1:1500; Santa Cruz; sc-
48381), mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal (1:1 000; Sigma 
Aldrich; A1978) or rabbit anti-LC3B monoclonal (1:1 000, 
Cell Signaling, Danves, MA; 2775) antibody overnight at 
4°C. After the membranes were washed three times, they 
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 
anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:3 000 
(Beijing Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, China) 
for 2 h at room temperature. Specific antibody binding was 
detected by electrochemiluminescence. The density of the 
scanned protein bands was measured by ImageJ 1.44p 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 484–492486
software and the results were presented as a percentage of 
the loading control.
Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription Pcr
The mRNA expression of Beclin-1 and LC3 was assessed 
by real-time PCR with SYBR Green (Sigma) detection in 
the Mx3005 real-time PCR system (Atratagene, CA). Total 
RNA was extracted from the spinal tissue at different time 
points using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, 
15596-026). Total RNA (3 μg) was reverse-transcribed 
into cDNA. The thermal profile for SYBR Green PCR was 
95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 
95°C for 5 s, and annealing/extension at 60°C for 20 s 
each. The primer sequences were as follows: LC3, sense: 
5’-CATGCCGTCCGAGAAGACCT-3’ and antisense: 5’-
GATGAGCCGGACATCTTCCACT-3’ (GenBankTM 
accession number, NM022867.2); Beclin-1, sense: 5’-
TTGGCCAATAAGATGGGTCTGAA-3’ and antisense: 5’-
TGTCAGGGACTCCAGATACGAGTG-3’ (GenBankTM 
accession number, NM001034117.1). Samples were 
normalized against GAPDH (Cell Signaling; 2118) 
expression to ensure equal loading. The specificity of the 
amplified product was monitored by its dissociation curve. 
The results, expressed as fold difference in the number of 
LC3 or Beclin-1 copies relative to the number of GAPDH 
gene copies, were determined by the relative quantitative 
2-ΔΔCt method. ΔΔCt = ΔCt (target gene) − ΔCt (GAPDH); 
ΔCt (target gene) = Ct (experimental - target) − Ct (control 
- target); and ΔCt (GAPDH) = Ct (experimental - GAPDH) − 
Ct (control - GAPDH).
tissue Preparation
At 2 h and 42 days after SCI, and immediately after sham 
operation, the animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral 
hydrate (0.3 mL/100 g, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 
0.1 mol/L PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) 
in 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH 7.4). Then the spinal tissue was 
removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 6–8 h, cryoprotected 
in 30% sucrose in 0.1 mol/L PBS for 72 h, embedded in 
Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., 
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and sectioned at 10 μm on a cryostat 
(CM3050 S, Leica, Deerfield, IL). Every 50th section was 
collected and placed on microscope slides coated with 
poly-L-Lysine. We collected nine sequential sections, 4 mm 
in length, centered at the epicenter, at 0.5-mm intervals 
along the length of the cord. These sections were stored 
at −20°C until use for immunofluorescence staining, Nissl 
staining, or myelin sheath staining.
Immunofluorescence Staining
Frozen sections at the epicenter collected 2 h after injury 
were washed in 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH 7.35) containing 0.3% 
Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 3% milk and 5% 
FBS in 0.1 mol/L PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and 
then incubated with rabbit anti-LC3 antibody (1:400; Cell 
Signaling) and mouse anti-NeuN (1:100; Millipore, Billerica, 
MA, MAB377) overnight at 4°C. After rinsing in PBS, the 
sections were incubated with a mixture of goat anti-rabbit 
TRITC and goat anti-mouse FITC fluorescence-conjugated 
secondary antibodies (1:100, Beijing Zhongshan Golden 
Bridge Biotechnology) for 40 min at room temperature. The 
ventral horn in these slides was observed under a laser 
confocal microscope (Olympus, FV1000).
Histological Assessment
Nine sections collected at 42 days after injury were Nissl-
stained to detect ventral horn motoneurons. In brief, the 
sections were placed in 1:1 alcohol/chloroform overnight, 
then rehydrated with 95% ethanol to distilled water, and 
stained in 0.1% cresyl violet for 10 min at 37°C. After 
rinsing in distilled water, sections were differentiated with 
95% ethanol for 1 min, dehydrated in 100% ethanol for 
2 × 2 min, cleared in xylene for 2 × 2 min and covered by 
a resinous medium. The area for counting motoneurons 
was defined by drawing a horizontal line from one side of 
the transverse section to the other passing through the 
central canal and the numbers of ipsilateral ventral horn 
motoneurons were calculated by ImageJ 1.44p software[26].
To evaluate the extent of spared myelin in white matter, 
the cross-sections were stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) 
and examined 42 days after SCI. In brief, the sections 
were placed in 95% ethanol for 5 min and stained in 0.1% 
solvent blue 38 (Sigma) in acidified 95% ethanol in a 57°C 
oven overnight. After rinsing off excess stain with 95% 
ethanol and distilled water, sections were differentiated with 
0.05% lithium carbonate and 70% ethanol several times 
until the gray matter was largely unstained and white matter 
sharply defined. Sections were rinsed in distilled water and 
then counterstained with cresyl violet for 30–40 s. Then 
the sections were differentiated in 95% ethanol for 1 min

after rinsing in distilled water, dehydrated in 100% ethanol 
for 2 × 2 min, cleared in xylene for 2 × 2 min and covered 
by a resinous medium. The images (×40 magnification) 
were captured using an Olympus digital camera. The LFB-
positive area (blue) of spared white matter was analyzed by 
ImageJ 1.44p[26], and the ratio of LFB-stained residual white 
matter to normal white matter was calculated.
behavioral testing
The motor function of the hindlimbs was evaluated using 
the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale[27] for six 
weeks following SCI. The BBB locomotor rating scale 
is widely used to test the behavioral consequences of 
SCI in rats[28]. The BBB values were determined by three 
trained observers who were unaware of the experimental 
procedures, and averaged.
statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SD, and were analyzed with 
one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis. BBB 
scores were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA 
followed by the Tukey-Kramer test. All statistical values 
were calculated using SPSS 16.0. P <0.05 was considered 
to be statistically significant.

Expression of Lc3 and beclin-1 Increased in scI rats 
To investigate the changes in autophagy at different times 
after SCI, the mRNA expression and protein levels of 
Beclin-1 and LC3 were measured by real-time PCR and 
Western blot analysis respectively. The level of autophagy 
increased (P <0.05) at 1, 2, and 6 h after injury compared 
with the sham-operated group. Both the protein and mRNA 
levels of LC3 and Beclin-1 peaked at 2 h post-surgery 
versus the sham group (P <0.01) (Figs. 1 and 2).
VPA reduced the Levels of Lc3 and beclin-1
Western blot analysis showed that VPA treatment 
decreased the Beclin-1 and LC3-II protein levels at 2 h 
after SCI compared with the vehicle-treated rats (P <0.05, 
P <0.01; Fig. 3A–C). Immunofluorescence staining of the 
epicenter sections also showed that at 2 h after the injury, 
LC3 was increased compared with the sham operation, 
and displayed a punctate pattern in the cell soma. VPA 
decreased the LC3 staining, as revealed by decreased 
numbers of LC3 puncta under confocal microscopy (Fig. 
3D).
VPA Promoted Neuroprotection Following scI
At 42 days after injury, there was a trend of increase in the 
number of motoneurons near the injury epicenter in VPA-
treated rats (relative to the vehicle control). VPA increased 
the number of motoneurons at 2 mm both rostral and 
caudal to the epicenter (P <0.05 vs vehicle control) (Fig. 
4C). Representative photomicrographs of motoneurons 
from VPA-treated and vehicle-treated rats are shown in Fig. 
4A and B. 
Fig. 1. spinal cord injury (scI) increased Lc3 and beclin-1 mrNA levels. the levels of Lc3-II and beclin-1 mrNA were detected at various 
times after SCI by real-time PCR. mRNA expression of LC3-II (A) and Beclin-1 (B) was significantly increased at 1, 2, and 6 h, 
peaking at 2 h after SCI, compared with the sham-operated group. Mean ± SD (n = 6/group). *P <0.05, **P <0.01 vs sham control.

treated groups apparently declined compared with the sham-operated group. D: Quantification of LFB-positive spared myelin.

after surgery. the scores were significantly higher in the 
VPA-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group from 
weeks 4 to 6. Mean ± SD (*P <0.05 vs vehicle treatment, n = 
5/group).
VPA also reduced myelin sheath damage 1 mm rostral 
to the epicenter at 42 days after SCI (Fig. 5B), as reflected 
by LFB staining compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 5A). 
The total area of tissue preserved in injured rats receiving 
VPA or vehicle was apparently smaller than that in the 
sham control (Fig. 5C). VPA increased the LFB-positive 
spared myelin sheath ratio (30.96 ± 0.58% vs 19.67 ± 0.83% 
in vehicle control, P <0.05, Fig. 5D) at 1 mm rostral to the 
epicenter at 42 days after SCI. 
VPA Promoted Functional recovery Following scI
To assess the effect of VPA on hindlimb recovery from SCI, 
the BBB score was measured once a week for six weeks 
(Fig. 6). From weeks 4 to 6 after injury, the scores in the 
VPA-treated animals were consistently higher than those in 
the vehicle-treated animals. At 42 days, the scores declined 
in the VPA-treated and vehicle-treated groups compared 
with the sham-operated group, but the VPA-treated animals 
had higher scores than the vehicle-treated animals (BBB 
scores: Sham, 21; VPA, 13.39 ± 0.85; Vehicle, 10.13 ± 0.81, 
P <0.05 for both comparisons; Fig. 6).
DIscUssION
In the present study, we demonstrated that the charac-
teristics of autophagic expression in the thoracic spinal cord 
increased at 1, 2, and 6 h after SCI, and administration 
of VPA markedly decreased the Beclin-1 and LC3 protein 
levels at 2 h after SCI. As expected, VPA significantly 
reduced neuronal damage and improved locomotor 
function after SCI. To our knowledge, these are the first 
findings on a link between VPA-mediated neuroprotection 
and autophagy following SCI.
All forms of cell death (autophagy, apoptosis, and 
necrosis) can occur in neurons after cerebral ischemia[13]. 
Although autophagy and apoptosis spread into the lesion 
penumbra later than the necrosis that occurs at the injury 
epicenter after SCI, they can promote secondary cell 
death[9,15]. 
Autophagy is a physiological phenomenon that plays 
an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. 
Upon starvation or injury, autophagy is initiated to engulf 
damaged organelles and proteins to provide additional 
energy; however, in pathological conditions, autophagy 
may promote secondary cell death and become another 
form of cell death[9,29]. Previous research has demonstrated 
that Beclin-1 and LC3, biological markers of autophagy, 
can be detected in spinal tissue after SCI[9,16,30]. Beclin-1 is 
a unique autophagy-related protein, thought to be important 
in mediating the localization of other autophagy proteins to 
pre-autophagosomal structures[31]. Therefore, it is commonly 
used for autophagy detection. LC3, a mammalian homolog 
of yeast Atg8, is the most important and reliable marker in 
autophagy research[32]. In the formation of the autophagy 
membrane, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II is considered 
to be one of the symbols of autophagic induction, so LC3-
II is often used as a marker for autophagosomes[16]. A 
recent study found that the expression of Beclin-1 protein 
increases and autophagic cell death is promoted after 
SCI in a mouse model of spinal cord hemisection injury[9]. 
Similar to previous studies[9,30], here the expression of 
Beclin-1 increased sharply after contusion injury. The level 
of LC3-II was raised at 1 h after SCI, peaked at 2 h, and 
then decreased. The time-course of LC3-II change in our 
study is consistent with the finding by Chen[16], but not with 
another report showing that the rise of LC3-II is relatively 
late after SCI[15]. This discrepancy may reflect differences in 
the model.
To minimize the secondary cell death after SCI, it is 
imperative that drug therapy is performed promptly. VPA, 
Hai-Hu Hao, et al.    VPA reduces autophagy and promotes functional recovery after SCI in rats 491
a commonly-used drug for treating epilepsy and bipolar 
disorder, has been used for many years and there is no 
doubt about its safety. It is one of the HDAC inhibitors, 
enhances histone acetylation, and this results in chromatin 
structuring and gene regulation[21,33]. In the present study, 
we showed that autophagic activity was markedly inhibited 
by VPA, possibly by lowering the Beclin-1 and LC3-II 
protein levels. Immunofluorescence and laser confocal 
microscopy also demonstrated that the LC3 fluorescence 
that was located in the cytoplasm was markedly decreased 
at the epicenter in the VPA group. These data indicate that 
autophagic cell death is reduced by inhibiting autophagic 
activity by VPA. 
Previous studies showed that VPA promotes the 
repair of sciatic nerve injury[18], has anti-inflammatory and 
neuroprotective effects[25] and increases the expression 
of Bcl-2 and Hsp70 to inhibit apoptosis[21]. Combined 
with our results, these observations show that VPA has 
multiple roles in SCI. In the present study, VPA improved 
functional recovery after injury, significantly decreased the 
demyelinated area, and increased the number of spared 
motor neurons. Therefore, we suggest that VPA-induced 
neuroprotection and functional recovery following SCI may 
be, at least in part, associated with the inhibition of SCI-
induced autophagy activation. 
Further research is warranted to verify the specific 
role of autophagy in VPA-mediated neuroprotection after 
SCI. Besides, although Fu et al.[22] showed that the ERK 
pathway is involved in VPA-induced autophagy in glioma 
cells, the specific signaling pathways for VPA inhibition of 
autophagy after injury remain to be determined and need 
further studies. In conclusion, our results suggest that VPA 
inhibits injury-induced autophagy. Treatment using VPA 
for SCI may provide a new strategy to reduce secondary 
damage.
