results in long-lasting deficits, involving partial or
engineered cells encourages axonal regeneration in
the injured spinal cord (5,6). Compared with otherof neurologic function, affecting all levels below the
site of injury. Injured axons in the mammalian
spinal cord fail to regenerate across the lesion site
and do not re-establish synaptic contacts with
their destinations (1), largely because of a “natural
barrier” and a diminished intrinsic regenerative
capacity (2). This barrier consists of a cystic cavity
new strategies to treat such SCI is still a major
clinical challenge (4).
Transplanting embryonic stem cells, neural stem
cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are
experimental treatments that have provided prom-
ising results for regenerating injured tissue and for
improving neurologic function in animal models ofafter injury. We examined whether PRP could induce rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) differentiation in vitro and
whether a combination of BMSCs, PRP and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could provide additive therapeutic
benefits in vivo after spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods. BMSCs and BDNF-secreting BMSCs (BDNF-BMSCs) were cultured
with PRP for 7 days and 21 days, respectively, and neurofilament (NF)-200, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), microtubule-
associated protein 2 (MAP2) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) gene levelswere assessed.AfterT10 hemi-section in 102
rats, 15-mL scaffolds (PRP alone, BMSCs, PRP/BMSCs, BDNF-BMSCs or PRP/BDNF-BMSCs) were transplanted into the
lesion area, and real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural studies were
performed. Results. The messenger RNA expression of NF-200, GFAP, MAP2 and p70S6K was promoted in BMSCs and
BDNF-BMSCs after culturewithPRP in vitro. BDNF levelswere significantly higher in the injured spinal cord after implantation
of BDNF-BMSCs. In the PRP/BDNF-BMSCs group at 8 weeks postoperatively, more GFAP was observed, with less accu-
mulationof astrocytes at the graft-host interface.Rats that receivedPRPandBDNF-BMSC implants showed enhancedhind limb
locomotor performance at 8 weeks postoperatively compared with control animals, withmore axonal remyelination. Conclusions.
A combined treatment comprising PRP and BDNF-overexpressing BMSCs produced beneficial effects in rats with regard to
functional recovery after SCI through enhancing migration of astrocytes into the transplants and axonal remyelination.

fied atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide, and thestem cells, BMSCs are easy to obtain, receptive to
foreign gene transfer and exist in abundance (7,8).
BMSCs are ideal cellular targets for genetic
engineering and neurotrophic factor production.
Because most of these cells die after transplantation
as a result of ischemia and hypoxia followed by
infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lesion
zone, combined therapy using stem cells and bio-
logic scaffolds is necessary to promote adhesion and
differentiation of grafted cells. In addition, the
cavity, surrounded with glia scar and other inhibi-
tory extracellular matrices, may interfere with the
re-growth of axon. The ideal biologic scaffold is
important to minimize the physical gap, decrease
formation of inhibitory extracellular matrices and
reduce the inflammatory response. Platelet-rich
plasma (PRP) is a biologic product of concentrated
platelets that is collected from autologous blood.
PRP secretes a large quantity of growth factors,
including platelet-derived growth factor, trans-
forming growth factor-b1 and transforming growth
factor-b2, insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin-
like growth factor-II, epidermal growth factor and
vascular endothelial growth factor (9). Platelet-
derived growth factor protects neurons by sup-
pressing N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-evoked current
and translocating the glutamate transporter to the
cell membrane (10). Transforming growth factor-b1
increases synthesis of extracellular matrix compo-
nents and promotes neuron survival (11). Insulin-
like growth factor-I specifically enhances outgrowth
of corticospinal motor neurons axons in vitro (12).
PRP has been used to promote regeneration of
peripheral nerves after injury, including the sciatic,
cavernous and facial nerves (13e15). Previous
studies have shown that the combined use of PRP
and BMSCs has a synergistic effect on enhancing
peripheral nerve regeneration (16). We reasoned
that a PRP scaffold would potentiate the efficacy of
BMSC-based treatments for SCI because most
studies suggest that the cytokine receptors associ-
ated with PRP growth factors are widely localized
on the surface of neurons and glia in the central
nervous system (17). However, PRP contains few
typical neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF, which
play an early anti-inflammatory role and have been
shown to promote sprouting of corticospinal tract
neurons after SCI (18e20). Zurita et al. (21)
demonstrated that PRP scaffolds with BDNF
allowed most BMSCs to survive and differentiate
into neural phenotype cells compared with fibrin
scaffolds. We hypothesized that a combined treat-
ment with BDNF-overexpressing BMSCs and
a PRP scaffold in animals with SCI would have
more beneficial effects for protecting neurons and
promoting axonal regeneration.medium was changed every 2 days. When adherent
cells reached 80e90% confluence, they were
detached with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco,
Shanghai, China) and re-plated at 1:3 in regular
growth medium to allow for continued passaging.
BMSCs of passage 3 with the same cell line were
collected for either in vitro experiments or seeding
into the scaffold. Cells performed a maximum of six
doublings during expansion and culturing proce-
dures. Monolayer cultured cells were detached by
mechanical scratch and filtered through a stainless
steel mesh filter to eliminate cell aggregates from the
single-cell suspension. After centrifugation, cells were
blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min.
Cells were then incubated with 5 mL of anti-mouse
antibodies for 30 min on ice from Biolegend (San
Diego, CA, USA): APC-CD44, APC/Cy7-CD45,
PE/Cy7-CD73, Percp/Cy5.5-CD90 and FITC-
CD105. Appropriate isotype control antibodies were
used to exclude non-specific binding. After washing,
the samples were analyzed using a BD FACSCanto II
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA).
BMSCs were exposed to adenovirus-BDNF-GFPMethods
Adenoviral vectors
Adenoviral replication-defective recombinant vectors
(Microbix Biosystems, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada)
are type 5 vectors that express transgenes under the
transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus pro-
moter. Briefly, we amplified the coding sequence of
rat BDNF complementary DNA (cDNA) by the
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
and ligated them into the pDC315-EGFP plasmid
(Genechem Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China) to produce
pDC315-BDNF-EGFP. The identity of the BDNF
cDNA obtained was confirmed by sequencing
and comparison with the GeneBank sequence
NM_012513.3. The rat BDNF primer sequence was
forward, 50-GAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGGTCG-
CCACCATGACCATCCTTTTCCTTAC-30, and
reverse, 50-TCACCATGGTGGCGACCGGTCTT-
CCCCTTTTAATGGTC-30. The pDC315-EGFP
vector was propagated in HEK293 cells, purified and
titered by endpoint dilution (titer ¼ 1  109 plaque-
forming units/mL).
BMSCs isolation, culture and adenovirus infection
BMSCs were purified as described previously (8,22).
Briefly, BMSCs were harvested from tibias and
femurs of 4-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats under
aseptic conditions and purified and expanded in
culture. Cells were maintained at 37C in a humidi-

BMSCs (BDNF-BMSCs) were analyzed by flow
cytometry. Rat BDNF enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay kits (Boster, Hubei, China) were used to
quantify the BDNF concentration in the supernatant
of BDNF-BMSCs or BMSCs. The implanted
BMSCs were stained with chloromethyl-benzamido-
dialkylcarbocyanine (CM-DiI; Molecular Probes,
Carlsbad, California, USA) (23). Briefly, cells in
suspension were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and incubated with CM-DiI at a
concentration of 2 mg/mL PBS for 5 min at 37C
and 15 min at 4C. After labeling, CM-DiI-labeled

There were 27 Sprague-Dawley rats sacrificed to
serve as a source of blood. From the right atrium of
each rat, 4 mL of fresh blood treated with 3.8%
sodium citrate was obtained in a sterile tube. Briefly,
the platelets were enriched by a two-step centrifuga-
tion process, as described previously (22). PRP and
whole blood samples were analyzed in an automatic

Surgical grafting procedures and tissue retrieval
Spinal cord hemi-sectioned female Sprague-Dawley
rats (weight, 210e268 g, n ¼ 102) were used. The
animals were operated on according to the standard
guidelines approved by the Zhejiang University
Ethics Committee. The rats were divided into six
groups; the numbers of animals used for each group
and each examination are listed in Table I. All
surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital
anesthesia (40 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally)
and sterile conditions. The back musculature was
split at the midline, and a laminectomy was per-
formed at T10. After the dura was opened, a spinal
cord hemi-section was made with a sharp scalpel as
described previously (24); the scalpel was run
through the incision to ensure that the hemi-sectionwas complete. The scaffold was placed into the lesion
site, and the muscles and skin were sutured
(Figure 2D). No active motion of the hind limbs on
the injured side was observed in any of the animals
after the hemi-section. Rats received cyclosporine
and manual bladder expression daily until reflexive
bladder control returned. All animals survived the
experiment and were used for subsequent analysis;
No evidence of tumor or bone formation was
observed in any of the animals in our experiment.
Deep anesthesia was administered to 42 rats at 1,
4 and 8 weeks after surgery, and fresh spinal cord
containing the injury sites (10 mm in length) was
harvested immediately for protein and messenger
RNA (mRNA) measurements. Another 60 rats were
anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 4%

at 4C. Membranes were incubated in Tris-PBS with
anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP (1:2000)
(Zhongshan Golden Bridge, Beijing, China). Signals
were detected on Hyperfilm enhanced chem-
iluminescence with an imaging system (ChemiDOC
XRS, Molecular Imager; BioRad).
Immunofluorescence and immunochemistry
After cells were co-cultured with PRP for days 7 and
21, they were fixed with 70% ethanol and incubated
with 100 mL of primary antibody diluted 1:50 in PBS
for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. A secondary
fluorescence-coupled antibody (Alexa Fluor 555;
Molecular Probes) diluted 1:500 was followed for 20
min at room temperature. Three washing steps with
PBS and staining were performed thereafter. The
neurofilament (NF)-200, GFAP and microtubule-
associated protein 2 (MAP2) antibodies (Epitomics)
were applied according to published protocols. Cells
were examined using the CLSM, and pictures were
obtained.
Immunohistochemical procedures were per-
formed as described previously (25). Briefly, serial
5-mm coronal sections around the injured site were
mounted on slides and washed three times in PBS,
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min and
incubated for 1 h with 10% normal goat serum in
PBS. The sections were incubated with anti-GFAP
rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:100; Epitomics)
overnight in 5% normal goat serum in PBS at 4C.
The following day, the sections incubated with
secondary antibodies and visualized with dia-
minobenzidine (PV6001; Zhongshan Golden
Bridge). The sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin and placed in a coverslip with DPX
mountant (Merck, Poole, UK). Some reactions
omitted either the primary or the secondary antibody
to control for nonspecific background binding.
Ultrastructural studies
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), spec-
imens were fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h and
then dehydrated with a serial gradient of ethanol
(50%, 70%, 80%, 95%) for 15 min each and thenThe supernatants were collected, and protein
concentrations were determined by the Bradford
method using a spectrophotometer. Each sample was
separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted. The
membrane was incubated with anti-BDNF rabbit
polyclonal antibody (AB1534, 1:1000; Chemicon,with 100% ethanol for 20 min; the ethanol wasnormal gait). The test was performed 1, 7, 14, 21, 28
and 56 days postoperatively.
Data are presented as mean  SD. The statistical
analysis was performed with an independent sample
t test to compare two experimental groups and Tukey
test for multiple comparisons using SPSS computer
software for Windows, version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc,
Chicago, Illinois, USA). The level of significance was
set at P < 0.05.
Results
In vitro
Flow cytometry results revealed that BMSCstissues. We defined the host-graft interface as a start-
ing point “0” to measure the distances of astrocytes
that migrated into the lesion area at 200-mm intervals.
The number of GFAP-labeled astrocytes is presented
as astrocyte index at 0.2-mm, 0.4-mm, 0.6-mm, 0.8-
mm, 1.0-mm and 1.2-mm position. Astrocyte index is
a ratio of GFAP astrocyte amount at a specific position
over the astrocyte amount at “0” position, similar to
a recent study (26).
Behavioral testing and statistical analysis
Hind limb motor function was assessed using the
open-field Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) loco-
motor rating scale system. Individual rats were
placed on an open field and observed for 4 min by
two independent blinded examiners. Hind limbchanged three times. The blocks were immersed for
5 min in propylene oxide, which was changed twice,
and then immersed overnight in a mixture containing
equal amounts of propylene oxide and plastic resin
and embedded in Epon 812 (EMS, Fort Washington,
Pennsylvania, USA). Using TEM, ultra-thin sections
(50 nm) were taken with an ultra-microtome,
mounted on 150-mesh copper grids and stained with
5% uranyl acetate for 15 min and then with 1.5% lead
citrate for 5 min. The sections were examined under
an electron microscope (JEM 1230; Jeol Co, Tokyo,
Japan). The surface of PRP scaffolds was studied by
field emission scanning electron microscopy (S-4800;
Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan).
Quantification of astrocyte migration
For quantification of GFAP-positive astrocytes, three
GFAP-stained coronal sections equidistant through
the lesion area were used for analysis, using the Image-
Pro plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD,
USA). GFAP immunoreactivity was used as a marker

798 T. Zhao et al.CD45 (see supplementary Figure 1). Of BDNF-
BMSCs, 98.49% exhibited green fluorescent protein
(GFP) fluorescence. The detection GFP in the
BDNF-transduced BMSCs indicates that these cells
also expressed rat BDNF because BDNF and GFP
were both translated from the same mRNA
(Figure 1A). The concentration of BDNF in the
supernatant reached 20.36  0.9 ng/106 cells/24 h,
whereas the amounts of BDNF in the BMSCs and
PRP/BMSCs groups were 3.1  0.7 ng/106 cells/24 h
and 5.1  2.7 ng/106 cells/24 h, respectively.
The Western blot results also indicated a 3-fold
increased expression of BDNF in the engineered
BMSCs (Figure 1B).
Expression of NF-200, GFAP, MAP2 and ribo-
somal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) genes was
analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
(Figure 1CeF). These mRNA genes increased in the
PRP/BMSCs and PRP/BDNF-BMSCs groups
compared with the BMSCs group, especially genes
of NF-200, GFAP and MAP2. However, there is no
significant expression of NF-200, GFAP and MAP2

In vivo
The transplanted CM-DiI-labeled BMSCs were
easily identified within the lesion zone by their red
fluorescence at both 1 week and 8 weeks after
transplantation. The distribution of BMSCs in the
injured SCI at 1 week and 8 weeks is shown in
Figure 3. At 1 week, the transplanted BMSCs and
PRP were mostly confined to the injury area
(Figure 3A,B). At 8 weeks, numerous BMSCs were
found outside of the lesion (Figure 3C,D).
At 7 days postoperatively, we observed an obvious
increase in BDNF expression in the injured spinal
cords of transplanted BDNF-BMSCs and PRP/
BDNF-BMSCs groups by Western blot, indicating
that the transplanted BDNF-BMSCs expressed
BDNF in vivo (Figure 4A). We found a significant

after applying PRP with BMSCs or engineered

group expressed more NF-200 than other groups at 4
weeks and 8 weeks postoperatively. All PRP groups
(PRP, PRP/BMSCs and PRP/BDNF-BMSCs) showed
increasedGFAP expression both at the gene and at the
protein levels compared with control groups (BMSCs
and BDNF-BMSCs) at 8 weeks (Figure 4D,E),
although therewere no significant differences between
PRP/BDNF-BMSCs and BDNF-BMSCs groups at
4 weeks postoperatively (Figure 4D).
Histologic examination performed 8 weeks after
hemi-sectioning the spinal cord revealed that few
astrocytes were observed in the epicenter of the
injury in the vehicle-treated group, and a cyst cavity
had formed in the PRP group (Figure 5A,B). In the
BMSCs group, GFAP-positive cells had a disorderly
arrangement, and there were numerous small, round
lymphocytes diffused in the injured spinal cord
(Figure 5C). All PRP groups showed significantly
more astrocytes in the lesion site compared with
control groups (P < 0.05). Few astrocytes migrated
into the graft region in the vehicle-treated and PRP

In contrast, in grafts when PRP was co-transplanted
with BMSCs or only BDNF overexpressing BMSCs,
more migration of astrocytes into the transplants was
observed (Figure 5D,E). In the PRP/BDNF-BMSCs
group, astrocytes migrated throughout the entire
length of the lesion area, as they were seen in the
rostral and caudal graft segments by immunohisto-
chemistry (Figure 5F,G). The astrogliotic response
at the graft-host interface of BDNF-BMSCs and
PRP/BDNF-BMSCs groups was reduced compared
with the vehicle-treated and PRP groups
(Figure 5H). In the PRP/BMSCs group, 40% more
GFAP-positive astrocytes were found at the graft-
host interface than in the PRP/BDNF-BMSCs group
(P ¼ 0.003), whereas there were no significant
differences among the vehicle-treated, BDNF-
BMSCs and PRP/BDNF-BMSCs groups.
TEM revealed severe demyelination in the
vehicle-treated, PRP and BMSCs groups. Hollow
and collapse of sheaths emerged in the vehicle-treated
group (Figure 6A). The PRP and BMSCs groups
showed detached and disrupted myelin sheets on the
myelinated axons (Figure 6B,C). There were also

with more myelin sheaths spared (Figure 6E).
However, there was significant axonal remyelination
and the more active oligodendrocytes in the PRP/
BDNF-BMSCs group at 8 weeks (Figure 6F).
Motor function of the right leg was intact, and
21 points were scored for all animals before
SCI. All experimental animals exhibited a gradual
improvement in hind limb locomotor function
during the 8-week recovery period. The PRP/BDNF-
BMSCs group recovered with a BBB score (Basso-
Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor rating scale system) of
nearly 20 (Figure 7). Statistical analyses indicated
that the BBB scores of the PRP/BDNF-BMSCs
group were higher than the BBB scores in other
groups at 8 weeks after transplantation (P < 0.05).
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that a combination
of PRP scaffolds with BDNF-overexpressing BMSCs
had a synergistic effect on promoting astrocyte
migration and axonal remyelination. The results

BMSCs locally applied into the injury area of the
spinal cord, which was similar to the effect of BDNF-
BMSCs transplantation alone. These results were in
accordance with previous studies. Hiraizumi et al.
(27) used platelet-derived wound healing formula to
improve the extracellular microenvironment of the
remaining neurons, and Sasaki et al. (19) demon-
strated that BDNF-modified human BMSCs had
additive neuroprotective effects and increased axonal
sprouting.
In our in vitro study, we investigated gene
changes after the BMSCs or BDNF-BMSCs co-
cultured with PRP for 7 days and 21 days. The
increased expression of the NF-200, GFAP and
MAP2 genes indicated that PRP promoted BMSCs
expression of neuronal gene markers in gene levels.
In the PRP/BDNF-BMSCs group, the expression of
these genes was higher than in the other groups,
indicating PRP and BDNF have additive effects on
BMSCs compared with using PRP or BDNF alone,
as described previously (21). p70S6K, a down-

decrease the BMSCs proliferation more or less (30),
as more genes of p70S6K were detected in PRP/
BMSCs than PRP/BDNF-BMSCs group. We
cultured BMSCs with PRP in liquid form and
renewed the PRP every other day. Some experiments
suggested that culturing BMSCs in PRP without
thrombin might be a better choice for expanding
BMSCs in vivo for clinical use (31). However, the
significant expression of NF-200, GFAP and MAP2
by immunofluorescence was not detected after co-
culturing for 7 days and 21 days. The reason might
be that BMSCs in the monolayer culture with PRP
do not have neuronal potential, whereas BMSCs
cultured in a three-dimensional environment might
possess the ability (32e34).
The implantation of 15-mL scaffolds separated
the terminal of the transected spinal cord completely
(with a distance of 1.2 mm); however, this created
a tight junction in the injured terminals by clot
retraction at the same time. The hemi-section model
allows for precise, consistent and reproducible
severing of the spinal cord. It is an injury similar to
that caused by stab wounds, gunshots and other
penetrating injuries to the spinal cord (35).
BDNF levels assayed by Western blot in the
hemi-sected spinal cord increased at 7 dayspostoperatively in all PRP groups, but the level was
significantly higher in the PRP/BDNF-BMSCs
group. Previous studies showed that BMSCs could

BMSCs, PRP and BDNF for SCI 801secret BDNF (29,36), which was consistent with
the BMSCs group of this study. Expression of
BDNF and NF-200 was up-regulated in the PRP/
BDNF-BMSCs group at 4 weeks postoperatively;
this indicates that the BDNF-BMSCs could main-
tain high levels of BDNF during the post-injury
period and trigger the up-regulation of NF-200
mRNA in the spinal cord (37). An additional
trophic effect is needed to promote axonal regen-
eration and the expression of neurofilament after
SCI (38,39).
Accumulations of astrocytes, which participate in
the formation of the glial scar at the interface of the
injury area, were an inhibitory barrier for neural
regeneration (40). Some more recent studies have
suggested that astrocytes may protect neurons after
injury (41). As we revealed that PRP inducing
astrocytic cell fate is weak in vitro, and a previous
study suggested BDNF-BMSCs did not differentiate
into glial or neuronal elements in vivo (19,42), the
astrocytes emerging in the epicenter of injury of the
present study were considered as migration of host
astrocytes. Treatment with only PRP promotes
astrocyte proliferation but with little migration,
leading to the formation of glial scar at the interface
of the cyst cavity. The transplantation of PRP and
BMSCs decreased the accumulation of astrocytes,

transplant group recovered to nearly 20 on the BBB scale. A
statistical analysis indicated that the BBB scores at 4 weeks and 8
weeks after injury in the PRP/BDNF-BMSCs transplantation
group were significantly higher than the BBB scores of the PRP/
BMSCs, BMSCs, PRP and vehicle-treated groups. $P < 0.05

802 T. Zhao et al.and robust astrocytes migrated into the epicenter of
the injury. However, major migration of astrocytes
was also observed in the BDNF-BMSCs group;
BDNF was suggested to induce a premature trans-
formation of glia into astrocytes by increasing bone
morphogenetic protein-7 expression (43). The
expression of GFAP was the highest in the PRP/
BDNF-BMSCs group compared with other groups
(except the PRP group) at 8 weeks after surgery. In
addition, there were fewer astrocytes at the graft-host
interface; this might be explained by the fact that
most migration of astrocytes occurred into the graft
environment in the PRP/BDNF-BMSCs group
(Figure 5).
The astrocyte-oligodendrocyte/myelin interaction
was believed to play an important role in the remye-
lination process (44,45), although the increased
expression of BDNF promotes remyelination of
axons by affecting oligodendrocytes (46,47). We
could find more spared axonal remyelination and
oligodendrocytes in PRP/BDNF-BMSCs group by
ultrastructural examination; this may be attributed to
the increased migration of astrocytes into the lesion
area and grafted BDNF-BMSCs, which can provide
a favorable substrate for stabilizing the regen-
erating axons in the inhibitory environment (48,49).
The PRP/BDNF-BMSCs group showed a better
BMSCs vs. BMSCs alone).functional result, which followed a greater amount of
axonal remyelination.
There are several limitations to this study. First,
CM-DiI was used to track the transplanted BMSCs
to confirm the transplanted BMSCs were alive
during the 8-week period. However, DiI was re-
ported to be represented by phagocytic cells followed
by donor cell apoptosis, and BMSCs outside of the
lesion may be due to the movement of macrophage
(50), making it difficult to determine the fate of the
transplanted cells. Although it was reported that
BMSCs transduced with the adenoviral vectors
produced greater target gene expression compared
with BMSCs transduced with lentiviral vector (51),
the decreased expression of target gene after 4 weeks
in vivo makes it difficult to observe the expression of
GFP (52). Our future research will focus on
culturing BMSCs in three-dimensional growth
systems (with or without PRP) and involve a new
strategy to elaborate the mechanism of BMSCs
migration after delivery. Second, the concentrations
of key growth factors in PRP that were involved in
axonal growth, differentiation of BMSCs and
synthesis of matrix components were not measured
in the present study. A controversial factor with the
application of PRP is different methods of its prep-
aration because it can significantly influence the
concentration of platelets and growth factors and
consequently their repair capacity (53). More recent
research suggested that reduced platelet concentra-
tion did not harm PRP effectiveness for tissue repairs
in vivo (54).
In conclusion, despite such limitations, we
believe that this study provides valuable information
on the influence of a PRP scaffold in the treatment of
SCI. Transplantation of autologous BMSCs or pro-
grammed BMSCs in conjunction with a PRP scaf-
fold might provide therapeutic opportunities for
improving axonal remyelination and functional
recovery in humans.
