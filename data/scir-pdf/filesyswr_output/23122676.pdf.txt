their diffusion in the body. Therefore, it requires periodic injections.
To solve these problems, a specific collagen or laminin binding
domainwas fused to the growth factor [24,34e38]. CNTF and BDNF
are two important factors in nerve regeneration. It had been
reported that BDNF had strong effects on neuronal survival while
CNTF was effective in stimulating neurite outgrowth [39]. After the
nerve injury, axons will be destroyed and the neurons will undergo
apoptosis. Thus, co-delivery of CNTF and BDNF to the injury site
may provide better effect for the regeneration.

Biomaterials 34 (2013) 1302e1310These authors contributed equally to this work.Facial nerve injuries affect many people and the functional
recovery remains clinically challenging. To restore the motor and
sensory functions, the transected nerve fibers need to regenerate
across and beyond the injury site and form connections with the
target tissue. For extensive nerve lesions, a nerve graft is needed for
bridging the gap. Autologous nerve graft has been considered as the
golden standard [1,2]. However, donor tissue availability, extra
incisions, sacrifice of the donor nerve and danger of neuroma
forming are still the major concerning factors [3].
Biomaterials provide promising alternative for nerve injury
repair [4e6]. An ideal biomaterial should possess the following
functionalities: firstly, it should have good tissue compatibility and
been widely utilized for its favorable biocompatibility, biodegrad-
ability and weak immunogenic reactions [19]. In this study,
a collagen nerve conduit was produced to provide a “regenerated
room” for the injured nerve. Collagen and laminin are two main
extracellular matrixes in nerve system [20,21], the linear ordered
collagen scaffolds (LOCS) and the laminin modified linear ordered
scaffolds (L  LOCS) were both proper guiding materials for nerve
regeneration [22e24]. To guide the regeneration of the nerve fibers,
LOCS and L  LOCS were applied in the lumen of the tube
respectively.

nerve injuries. However, in practice, diffusion caused by the body fluids is the major obstacle in their
applications. To retain CNTF or BDNF on the scaffolds, we produced collagen binding CNTF (CBD-CNTF),
collagen binding BDNF (CBD-BDNF) and laminin binding CNTF (LBD-CNTF), laminin binding BDNF (LBD-
BDNF) respectively. In this work, we developed laminin modified LOCS fibers (L LOCS) by chemical cross-
linking LOCS fibers with laminin. Collagen binding or laminin binding neurotrophic factors were combined
with LOCS or L  LOCS, and then filled them into the collagen nerve conduit. They were found to guide the
ordered growth of axons, and improve thenerve functional recovery in the rat facial nerve transectionmodel.
The combination of CNTF and BDNF greatly enhanced the facial nerve regeneration and functional recovery.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Preparation of collagen nerve conduit
Collagen membrane and collagen solution were used to make up collagen
nerve conduit. The collagen membrane was made from bovine collagen by freeze-
drying. Collagen solution (15 mg/ml, in 0.5 M acetic acid) was evenly placed into
the scrolled collagen membrane and air-dried. The collagen conduit was then
treated with cross-linking solution (30 mM EDC and 10 mM NHS in 50 mM MES
solution, pH 5.5) overnight. After washing with NaH2PO4 (0.1 M) and distilled
water, molds were removed from the collagen conduits after freeze-drying
(Fig. 2A,B).
2.2. Preparation of LOCS and laminin coated LOCS (L  LOCS)
LOCS was prepared from bovine aponeurosis as described previously [40].
Briefly, fresh white aponeurosis were separated frommuscles and cleaned with cold
distilled water. After removing the adjunctive tissues, including the residual
muscles, connective tissues and fats, the aponeurosis were treated with 1% tri
(n-butyl) phosphate (TnBP) (Aldrich, Munich, Germany) in 50 mM TriseCl buffer
(pH 8.0) for 48 h at 4 C to remove the cellular components. Then the soluble
proteins and cellular elements were further extracted in 50 mM TriseCl buffer
(pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl) at 4 C for 48 h. Subsequently, the samples were soaked in
distilled water and rinsed repeatedly to remove the residual agents completely.
The collagen filaments (LOCS) were separated from processed aponeurosis and
freeze-dried (Fig. 2C). The microstructure of LOCS was observed by scanning
electron microscope (Fig. 2D).
L  LOCS was prepared as described before [24]. Briefly, a bunch of LOCS fibers
(4 mm  1 mm  1 mm) was soaked in 50 mM MES solution (pH 5.5) with NHS
(1.2 mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich) and EDC (2 mg/ml; SigmaeAldrich), incubated at 37 C
for 15 min, then loaded with 10 mL laminin (100 mg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich), and
incubated at 37 C for 3 h.
2.3. Production of CBD-CNTF, LBD-CNTF, CBD-BDNF and LBD-BDNF
The recombinant proteins CBD-CNTF, LBD-CNTF, CBD-BDNF and LBD-BDNFwere
expressed, purified, refolded and identified as described previously [22,24].

2.4. Surgical procedures of facial nerve transection and grouping
Experiments were performed in accordance with Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals from National Institutes of Health and approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Nanjing University.
Female Spraguee Dawley rats (200e230 g) were anesthetized by an intra-
peritoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg body weight), after
sterilization, an incision was made subcutaneously to expose the trunk of the
right facial nerve. A segment of 3 mm nerve was removed by sharp microsurgery
scissors. The proximal and distal nerve stumps were bridged by a 5 mm long
collagen nerve conduit, leaving 4 mm gap between the two ends. Two 8/0
monofilament nylon interrupted sutures were applied at each side of the anas-
tomosis. Then the muscle layers and the skin were sutured separately. The
procedure of the surgery was showed in Fig. 2E. All the animals were divided into
9 groups with different treatments. 1, the group of empty tube: the transected
nerve was bridged by an empty collagen nerve conduit; 2, the group of LOCS: the
transected nerve was bridged by the collagen nerve conduit filled with a bunch of
LOCS fibers (4 mm long and 1 mm diameter); 3, the group of CBD-CNTF: the
bridged collagen nerve conduit were filled with LOCS fibers (4 mm long and
1 mm diameter) loaded with 0.25 nmol CBD-CNTF; 4, the group of CBD-BDNF: the
bridged collagen nerve conduit were filled with LOCS fibers (4 mm long and
1 mm diameter) loaded with 0.25 nmol CBD-BDNF; 5, the group of CBD-
CNTF þ CBD-BDNF: the bridged collagen nerve conduit were filled with LOCS
fibers (4 mm long and 1 mm diameter) loaded with 0.125 nmol CBD-CNTF and
0.125 nmol CBD-BDNF; 6, the group of LOCS  L: the bridged collagen nerve
conduit were filled with L  LOCS fibers (4 mm long and 1 mm diameter); 7, the
group of LBD-CNTF: the bridged tubes were filled with L  LOCS fibers (4 mm
long and 1 mm diameter) carrying 0.25 nmol LBD-CNTF; 8, the group of LBD-
BDNF: the bridged collagen nerve conduit were filled with L  LOCS fibers
(4 mm long and 1 mm diameter) carrying 0.25 nmol LBD-BDNF; 9, the group of
LBD-CNTF þ LBD-BDNF: the bridged collagen nerve conduit were filled with
L  LOCS fibers (4 mm long and 1 mm diameter) carrying 0.125 nmol LBD-
CNTF þ0.125 nmol LBD-BDNF. All the animals were kept under standardized
laboratory conditions in an air-conditioned room with free access to food and
water. The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at different time points,
2.5. Nerve functional assessment
Vibrissal whisking evaluation and electrophysiology examination were per-
formed to evaluate the facial nerve function.
As previously described, whisker movements were divided into four different
categories with scores ranging from 0 to 3 (0, no whisker movement; 1, slight
whisker movement; 2, slow movement; 3, rapid movement undistinguishable from
the contralateral uninjured side) [41]. The whisker movement evaluation was per-
formed in every week after the injury. To avoid subjective bias, double-blind assay
was performed.
As for electrophysiological tests, the regenerated facial nerve was re-exposed
under general anesthesia at Week 16 post-surgery. The electrophysiological test

was evaluated by an electromyography system (RM6240, Chengdu, China). The
stimulating electrode was placed in the proximal end of the facial nerve trunk, the
record electrode was insert into the ipsilateral orbicularis oris muscle, the reference
electrode was insert into the ipsilateral fore limb subcutaneously. The compound
muscle action potentials (CMAPs) in both sides were measured. The ratio of CMAPs
in the injured sides compared with normal sides was used to evaluate the facial
nerve functional recovery.
2.6. Histological analysis
The histological assessments were performed at week 6 and week 16 after
operation. The regenerated nerves were isolated and fixed them in 4% (vol/vol)
formaldehyde for 48 h. Then the segments were embedded in paraffin. 5 mm sections
were cut from each segment and examined by immunohistochemistry using anti-
bodies to neurofilament (anti-NF, 1:1000 dilution; Abcam) and S100 (1:2000

we quantified the percentage of neurofilament-positive and S100-positive area
(positive staining area/total area) by selecting at least 3 randomly fields per sample
at 200 magnification. The remyelination of the regenerated nerves was observed
by transmission electron microscope. The number, diameter and the thickness of
the newborn myelin sheath were evaluated by Image-Pro Plus software (Media
Cybernetics).
2.6.1. Statistical analysis
The SPSS 13.0 was used for all statistical analysis. Multiple comparisons were
performed with one-way ANOVA (S-NK). P values <0.05 was considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. Collagen nerve conduit testing
The collagen tube was tested in an extreme facial nerve injury
model as described. Fig. 2FeI showed the nerve tissues regen-
erated in the silicon tube and the collagen tube. Compared with
the silicon tube, the collagen tube also could successfully sustain
the nerve regeneration without collapsing. Moreover, the collagen
nerve tube was degradable and showed better biocompatibility
in vivo.
3.2. Functional recovery of the injured facial nerve
Facial nerve controls the movements of the facial muscles. The
most obvious phenotype is the paralysis of whiskermovements after
transaction of the facial nerve trunk. The recovery of the whisker
movements was used to reflect the reconstruction of the nerve
conduction function. As showed in Fig. 3A, all the animals showed
complete facial paralyzed at the injury side immediately after the
showed slight whisker movement recovery (Grade 1). At Week 16,
the ratio of the animals that have reached Grade 2 had been
accessing to 70% and 50% in the two groups respectively. In the
groups of CBD-CNTF, CBD-BDNF, LBD-CNTF and LBD-BDNF, there
were about 10%e25% animals began to showed Grade 1 recovery at
Week 4, and about 30%e40% animals reached Grade 2 recovery at
Week 16.While in the groups of LOCS and L LOCS,10e25% animals
began to showed slight recovery (Grade1) at 5e6 weeks after injury,
and only 25% animals reached Grade 2 recovery at Week 16. The
recovery in the empty tube groupwas slower and limited, only about
10% animal began to show slight recovery at Week 7, and no animal
reached Grade 2 recovery till Week 16.
The electrophysiological index compoundmuscle actionpotentials
(CMAPs) at both the injury side and the healthy side were measured
at Week 16. The ratio of CMAPs in the injured sides compared with
normal sides was used to evaluate the facial nerve functional recovery
(Fig. 3B). Compared with the empty tube group, CMAP was signifi-
cantly restored in the groups of LBD-CNTF þ LBD-BDNF, CBD-
CNTF þ CBD þ BDNF, LBD-CNTF, LBD-BDNF, CBD-CNTF, CBD-BDNF
(n ¼ 8, p < 0.01). CMAP restoration of group LBD-CNTF þ LBD-BDNF
and CBD-CNTF þ CBD þ BDNF were up to 67  5.1% and 60  4.8%
respectively, which were significantly higher than other groups.
3.3. Histological analysis
The longitudinal and transversal sections of the newborn nerve
in each group were stained with anti-NF antibody for evaluating
the axon regeneration (Figs. 4 and 5). The results showed that,
compared with the other groups, the density of regenerated axons
in the distal end of the newborn nerve was significant higher in the

more similar with that of the normal nerve (Fig. 4). However, only
a few nerve fibers grew along the wall of the conduit and the
arrangement of the regenerated nerve fiber was much more
disordered in the empty tube.
The regeneration and migration of Schwann cells played key
roles for the successful axonal regeneration over the extreme
transected nerve gap. As it showed in Fig. 6, the groups of LBD-
CNTFþ LBD-BDNF and CBD-CNTFþ CBDþ BDNF exhibited the best
regeneration of the Schwann cell by showing their S-100 positive
staining area percentage, which were closed to normal level at
Week 16 after injury.
3.4. Remyelination analysis
Remyelination was another important process of nerve func-
tional recovery. The regenerated myelin sheaths were observed by
transmission electronmicroscope (TEM), and the number, diameter
and the thickness of the regenerated myelin sheaths were evalu-
ated (Fig. 7).
The regeneratedmyelin sheaths are smaller and thinner in all the
groups compared with the normal myelin sheaths. The quantity,
diameter and thickness of the myelin sheaths in the empty tube
group were much lower than those in other groups. The groups

the groups of LBD-CNTF þ LBD-BDNF, CBD-CNTF þ CBD þ BDNF,
LBD-CNTF, LBD-BDNF, CBD-CNTF, CBD-BDNF, the regeneration of
myelin sheaths had been significantly improved. Especially in the
groups of LBD-CNTFþ LBD-BDNF and CBD-CNTFþ CBD þ BDNF, the
newborn nerves showed the best remyelination, the quantity and
quality of the regenerated myelin sheaths were significantly higher
than those in other groups (Fig. 7, n ¼ 8, p < 0.05).
4. Discussion
In the present study, we had produced a biodegradable collagen
nerve conduit and performed the synergistic application of the
recombinant collagen or laminin binding CNTF and BDNF in the
facial nerve repair. The collagen or laminin binding proteins pre-
sented higher binding ability and sustained release kinetics at the
injury site. Though BDNF and CNTF works through different signal
mechanism, “cross-talk” exists in the downstream of the pathways
induced by the two factors. For example, CNTF can activate STAT3,
Ras/Raf/MAP/ERK Kinase/ERK/p90RSK, and PI3K/Akt pathways
[42e44], while the downstream of BDNF signaling includs Ras/
MAPK and PI3K/Akt [45,46]. The “overlapping” and “differences” in
the mechanisms of CNTF and BDNF pathway may amplify the
therapeutic efficiency. This may explain why the nerve regenera-
tion and functional recovery were significantly improved in the
groups of CBD-CNTF þ CBD-BDNF and LBD-CNTF þ LBD-BDNF in
our experiments.
After the injury, the groups of CBD-CNTF þ CBD-BDNF and LBD-
CNTF þ LBD-BDNF exhibited the earliest locomotion recovery, and
most of the rats in the two groups had achieved Grade 2 recovery at
Week 16 after the injury. The electrophysiology examination also
showed that the nerve conduct restoration were significantly
higher in the double-factor treated groups than that in the relative
single factor control groups. Consisting with the results of the
functional recovery, animals of the two double-factor treated
groups exhibited the best regeneration of axons, Schwann cells, and
myelin sheaths.
Though the nerve regeneration showed no significant differ-
ences between the groups of the laminin modified linear ordered
scaffolds (L  LOCS) and the groups of collagen linear ordered
scaffolds (LOCS), the average values of some tested indexes were
higher in the LBD-CNTF þ LBD-BDNF group than the CBD-
CNTF þ CBD-BDNF group. In addition, the regenerated myelin
sheaths in the groups treated with laminin modified scaffolds were
more close to the normal control (Fig. 7A). Laminin has been shown
to support the nerve regeneration, promoting neurite growth and
facilitating the growth cone formation. This may explain why
L  LOCS trended to be superior to LOCS. In the extreme nerve
injury model (the removal nearly the total length of the facial nerve
trunk), simple laminin and linear ordered scaffolds treatment were
not enough to sustain the nerve functional recovery. The applica-
tion of neurotrophic factors played more important roles for the
nerve regeneration, and the combination of CNTF and BDNF
showed the significant regeneration effect compared with single
factors. Thus the co-application of CNTF and BDNF is a more effi-
cient therapy strategy for the extreme nerve injuries.
5. Conclusion
We have produced a biodegradable collagen conduit together
with linear order scaffolds LOCS or L  LOCS to guide the ordered
regeneration of nerve fibers. Collagen or laminin binding CNTF and
BDNF were co-delivered to exert synergistic effect on nerve
regeneration. Both the collagen and laminin biomaterials could

mode, especially with the co-application of collagen or laminin
binding CNTF and BDNF.
