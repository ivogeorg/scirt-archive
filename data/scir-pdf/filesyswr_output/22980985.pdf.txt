SUMMARY
Neural stem cells (NSCs) expressing GFP were embedded into fibrin matrices containing growth
factor cocktails and grafted to sites of severe spinal cord injury. Grafted cells differentiated into
multiple cellular phenotypes, including neurons, which extended large numbers of axons over
remarkable distances. Extending axons formed abundant synapses with host cells. Axonal growth
was partially dependent on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) but not Nogo signaling.
Grafted neurons supported formation of electrophysiological relays across sites of complete spinal
transection, resulting in functional recovery. Two human stem cell lines (566RSC and HUES7)
embedded in growth factor-containing fibrin exhibited similar growth, and 566RSC cells
supported functional recovery. Thus, properties intrinsic to early stage neurons can overcome the
inhibitory milieu of the injured adult spinal cord to mount remarkable axonal growth resulting in
formation of novel relay circuits that significantly improve function. These therapeutic properties
extend across stem cell sources and species.
INTRODUCTION
Research over the last several decades has revealed numerous molecular mechanisms in the
environment of the adult central nervous system (CNS) that contribute to the failure of
axonal regeneration after injury, including myelin-associated proteins that inhibit axonal
growth (He and Koprivica, 2004; Buchli and Schwab, 2005), the deposition of inhibitory
extracellular matrix molecules around injury sites (Fawcett, 2006; Fitch and Silver, 2008),
and the lack of positive environmental stimuli such as growth factors (Tuszynski and Lu,
2008). The observation that at least some classes of adult CNS axons can grow over long
distances in peripheral nerve bridges supports the view that the adult CNS environment is
inhibitory (David and Aguayo, 1981; Houle et al., 2006). However, some studies indicate
that neuron-intrinsic mechanisms also contribute to axonal growth failure in the adult CNS

(Filbin, 2006; Kadoya et al., 2009). Indeed, the extent to which neuron-intrinsic mechanisms
alone can overcome the inhibitory growth environment of the adult CNS is actively debated.
To address this question, we grafted either freshly dissociated neural stem cells/progenitors
from green fluorescent protein (GFP) - expressing rat embryos (Bryda et al., 2006; Baska et
al., 2008; Mayer-Proschel et al., 1997), or cultured human stem cells derived from two
different sources (HUES7 cells and 566RSC cells from NeuralStem Inc.) to the adult
lesioned spinal cord. Expression of the GFP reporter gene in all cells provides an
unprecedented opportunity to track the fate, integration, process extension and
differentiation of grafted cell types within the inhibitory milieu of the adult injured spinal
cord.
We now report a remarkable capability of early stage neurons from different sources and
species to survive, integrate, extend axons over very long distances and form functional
relays in the lesioned adult CNS. These findings indicate that, despite the inhibitory milieu
of the adult CNS, neuron-intrinsic mechanisms are sufficient to support remarkably
extensive axonal growth and synapse formation after spinal cord injury, resulting in
formation of novel neuronal relays that restore electrophysiological activity and behavior.
Moreover, stem cells across species exhibit these properties, supporting the intrinsic
capabilities of these cells and suggesting translational relevance.
RESULTS
Fischer 344 adult rats underwent T3 complete spinal cord transection. Two weeks later, a
clinically relevant time point, we dissected embryonic day 14 (E14) spinal cords from
Fischer 344 rats ubiquitously expressing the GFP reporter gene. Grafts were trypsinized and
implanted as suspensions (Giovanini et al., 1997), but survived only at the host/lesion
margins and failed to fill the complete transection site. To enhance graft survival and filling
of the lesion, in new experiments the E14 neural stem cells were embedded into fibrin/
thrombin matrices containing a cocktail of growth factors (N=26 rats; see Methods).
Animals then underwent functional and electrophysiogical studies and were perfused 9
weeks after the initial injury.
Anatomical analysis revealed that grafted cells completely and consistently filled the lesion
cavity when assessed seven weeks post-grafting (Fig. 1A–1B). Grafted cells were not
observed to migrate into the host beyond the immediate region of the graft/lesion site.
Grafted cells primarily differentiated into neurons (27.5 ± 2.7% of all GFP-labeled cells),
oligodendroglia (26.6 ± 3.9%) and astrocytes (15.9 ± 1.6%) (Fig. 1C–1H and Suppl. Fig. 1).
Numerous large GFP-labeled cells co-localized with the mature neuronal markers NeuN
(Fig. 1C–1H), βIII tubulin (Tuj1) and MAP2 (Suppl. Fig. 2A–B). In addition to expressing
mature neuronal markers, many grafted cells also expressed choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT), characteristic of spinal motor neurons, and the inhibitory neuronal marker glutamic
acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) (Suppl. Fig. 2C–D).
Graft-derived spinal cord neurons extended large numbers of axons into the host spinal cord
in both rostral and caudal directions over remarkably long distances (Fig. 2). Emerging
GFP-labeled processes from grafts were axons, as demonstrated by co-labeling for the
axonal marker neurofilament (Fig. 2A). In the cephalad (rostral) direction, graft-derived
axons extended to C6 in all subjects examined (N = 6), and a distance of 25 mm from the T3
transection cavity into the C4 cervical segment in 5 of 6 subjects (Fig. 2E–F). Graft-derived
axons also extended caudally to the lower thoracic spinal cord (T10) in all subjects (N = 6),
continuing to the upper lumbar spinal cord, a distance of more than nine spinal segments (25
mm), in 4 of 6 subjects (2A–D, G–H). All animals with caudal extension of axons to L1 also
exhibited rostral extension of axons to C4, indicating that long-distance, bi-directional

axonal growth occurred commonly. To estimate the magnitude of axon outgrowth that can
be achieved by implantation of neural primordia into sites of spinal cord injury, we
stereologically (Rosenzweig et al., 2010) quantified 29,000 GFP-labeled axons emerging
from the graft in the caudal direction (0.5 mm caudal to the T3 transection site). This
number likely represents an underestimation, as dense bundles of axons that could not be
individually resolved were counted as single axons. The density of axons emerging from
grafts was highly consistent among all six subjects examined (Suppl. Fig. 3). In 12
additional subjects, progressive axon emergence from the lesion/graft site was serially
examined at time points of 1, 2, 3 and 7 days post-grafting (N=3 rats per time point). Axons
emerged from the graft/lesion site by day 2 after grafting, and extended at a rapid rate of 1–
2mm/day (Suppl. Fig. 4). The visualization of axon growth over time documents the
extension of new axons and excludes the possible artifact that grafted cells fused with host
neurons. Thus, axons extended in remarkably large numbers and over long distances,
including extension through adult white matter. Indeed, time course studies indicated that
initial axon outgrowth preferentially occurred through white matter (Suppl. Fig. 4).
Graft-derived axons in host white matter were frequently myelinated by host
oligodendrocytes (i.e., cells myelinating graft-derived axons were not labeled for GFP; Fig.
3A–B). In addition, grafted cells that differentiated into neurons extended axons from the
spinal cord lesion site into adjacent host ventral roots in every subject examined, with 6.8 ±
1.2 graft-derived axons quantified per 40μm-thick section of ventral root; Suppl. Fig. 2E–F).
56.7 ± 5.3% of these ventral root axons expressed the appropriate phenotypic motor
neuronal marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; Suppl. Fig. 3F), likely derived from
ChAT-expressing motor neurons inside grafts (Suppl. Fig. 2C). GFP-labeled axons were
rarely detected in dorsal roots.
GFP-labeled, graft-derived axons in the host spinal cord formed dense bouton-like terminals
around host dendrites and cell bodies, identified by labeling for the neuronal somal and
dendritic markers MAP-2, the neuronal somal marker Tuj1 (βIII tubulin), and the motor
neuron marker ChAT (Fig. 3C–E). Double immunofluorescent labeling for GFP and
synaptophysin suggested synapse formation between grafted and host neurons in both rostral
and caudal directions (Fig. 3E) at all distances from the lesion site, including sites sampled
25mm from the injury. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed synapse formation between
GFP-labeled graft-derived axons and host neurons and dendrites (Fig. 3F). Further, GFP-
labeled terminal boutons expressed either the excitatory transmitter marker vesicular
glutamate transporter 1/2 (vGlut1/2) or the inhibitory marker glutamic acid decarboxylase
65 (GAD65) (Fig. 3G–H). Many instances of co-localization of these terminal region
markers with ChAT were also found (Fig. 3G–H). Collectively, these findings demonstrate
exuberant projections of neural stem cell-derived axons from sites of spinal cord injury into
the adult spinal cord together with synapse formation.
Neurons of the developing spinal cord express receptors to myelin-associated inhibitors such
as Nogo (Josephson et al., 2002), a finding we confirmed in the present study in grafted
tissue (Suppl. Fig. 5A). Thus, insensitivity to myelin-based inhibitors is an unlikely
mechanism to account for the robust growth of axons observed in this study. Recently, the
tumor suppressor gene “phosphatase and tensin homolog” (PTEN) has been identified as a
major neuron-intrinsic regulator of axonal regeneration in the adult CNS (Park et al., 2008).
PTEN inhibits the activity of “mammalian target of rapamycin” (mTOR), and neuronal
knockout of PTEN has been reported to enhance central axonal regeneration (Park et al.,
2008; Liu et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011). To determine whether mTOR signaling is a
mechanism contributing to the extensive growth of neural stem cell-derived axons through
the lesioned adult CNS, we injected rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, into rats beginning two
days after placement of grafts into the lesion site (6 mg/kg intraperitoneally, n=6 rats; 7

controls underwent vehicle injections). When examined two weeks later, rats subjected to
mTOR blockade exhibited a significant, 50% reduction in graft-derived axonal outgrowth
from the lesion compared to vehicle-injected controls (P<0.05; Fig. 4A; Suppl. Fig. 5B–E).
Labeling for phospho-S6 (p-S6), an indicator of mTOR activity (Park et al., 2008),
demonstrated abundant expression in graft-derived neurons and substantial reduction
following rapamycin treatment (Suppl. Fig. 5H–J). Rapamycin injection did not alter neural
stem cell graft survival or differentiation (Suppl. Fig. 5F–G, K). These findings demonstrate
mTOR signaling as a mechanism contributing to the ability of early stage neurons to extend
axons in the adult lesioned CNS.
Importantly, host axons also penetrated neural stem cell grafts in spinal cord lesion sites,
including BDA-labeled reticulospinal axons and 5-HT labeled serotonergic (raphespinal)
axons (Fig. 4B–G). Host inputs into grafts were both locally and supraspinally derived.
While host supraspinal axons regenerated into grafts, in no case did they regenerate beyond
the graft into host spinal cord parenchyma caudal to the lesion site. Like graft-derived axons,
host axons penetrating grafts co-localized with the synaptic marker synaptophysin (Fig. 4F),
establishing a mechanism for host-to-graft connectivity.
Functional and behavioral outcomes were measured in subjects that underwent T3 complete
spinal cord transections and, two weeks later, neural stem cell implants in the lesion site
(Fig. 5A). Hindlimb locomotion was severely impaired in both lesion control and grafted
subjects for the first four weeks post-injury; in the 5th week (three weeks post-grafting),
recipients of neural stem cell grafts exhibited significant improvement on the BBB scale
(Basso et al., 1996), reaching a functional plateau by the 8th week post-lesion (p<0.01). The
mean BBB score reached a level of 7, indicating movement about each joint of the hindlimb,
in contrast to minimal movement if any in lesioned controls. To determine whether
functional improvement depended on regeneration of host axons into the graft/lesion site,
half the subjects underwent re-transection of the spinal cord just rostral to the T3 graft,
resulting in a complete abolition of behavioral recovery when measured one week later (Fig.
5A and Suppl. Fig. 6).
To confirm the dependence of functional recovery on host axonal regeneration into the
lesion site, electrophysiological measurements were made in 6 subjects. A stimulating
electrode was placed in the dorsal C7 spinal cord (3 spinal segments above the lesion) and
recordings were made at T6 (3 spinal segments below the lesion). In intact animals,
stimulation at C7 evoked a short latency (3.42± 0.32 msec) response (Fig. 5B-i) that was
entirely abolished by T3 complete transection (Fig. 5B-ii). In two-thirds of animals with
neural stem cell grafts in the lesion site, evoked responses were restored (Fig. 5B-iii).
Response latencies in the grafted group were prolonged (5.47 ± 0.24 msec compared to
3.42± 0.32 msec in intact subjects, P<0.05), suggesting formation of poly-synaptic relays
through the graft. Response amplitudes in the grafted group (0.09 ± 0.03 mV) were smaller
than intact subjects (0.27 ± 0.12 mV) (P<0.05; Fig. 5B-iii). Notably, re-transection of the
spinal cord just rostral to the T3 graft completely abolished detectable activity upon C7
stimulation even when using high intensity stimuli (Fig. 5B-iv). To determine whether
responses detected at T6 depended on the presence of synapses in the graft, the NMDA
receptor blocker kynurenic acid (50 mM) was applied to the graft at T3, 7 weeks post-lesion.
Kynurenic acid resulted in a significant, 50% reduction in the amplitude of the response
recorded at T6 but did not affect latency of the response, indicating that excitatory synaptic
transmission across the graft was required for detection of caudal transmission (Fig. 5C).
Thus, early stage neurons grafted in a fibrin matrix containing a growth factor cocktail
extend large numbers of axons over long distances in the lesioned spinal cord, and form
neuronal relays that significantly improve electrophysiological and functional outcomes.

The magnitude of functional effect substantially exceeds those previously reported in studies
of fetal or stem cell grafts to the injured spinal cord, possibly due to enhanced graft survival
generated by co-implantation with fibrin matrices containing growth factors. These results
suggest strong translational possibilities. Accordingly, we repeated these studies using
cultured human neural stem cells.
6 adult female athymic nude rats (T-cell deficient) underwent T3 complete transections. One
week later, a suspension of neural stem cells derived from human fetal spinal cord
(566RSCUBQT-GFP, see Methods; gift of NeuralStem, Inc.) was embedded into fibrin
matrices containing a growth factor cocktail, as above. These cells are currently being used
in a human clinical trial in amytrophic lateral sclerosis (Boulis et al., 2011). Function was
assessed over the next 7 weeks in grafted animals and compared to six lesioned controls,
then rats were sacrificed for anatomical studies. Grafts completely and consistently filled
lesion cavities (Fig. 6A), and a majority of grafted cells (57±1.7%) expressed the mature
neuronal marker NeuN (Fig. 6B). As in rat donor studies, remarkable numbers of axons
emerged from the grafts and extended for very long distances, over a total of 17 spinal
segments (Fig. 6C–E and Fig. 7). In the rostral direction, axons extended 25 mm above the
lesion site to the C4 level (Fig. 7A–C), and in the caudal direction axons reached the upper
lumbar spinal cord (Fig. 7D–F). GFP-labeled, graft-derived axons formed bouton-like
terminals in the host gray matter and expressed human-specific synaptophysin (Fig. 6F),
suggesting synaptic connectivity between grafted human and host rat neurons. Tumor
formation by implanted human neurons was not observed within the lesion site or remotely
in the host spinal cord. As observed in rat donor studies, grafts of human neural stem cells
induced significant locomotor recovery after T3 complete transection (Fig. 6G), with
movement about all joints of the lower extremities. Once again, re-transecting the spinal
cord immediately rostral to the lesion site abolished hindlimb movement, indicating that
functional recovery was dependent on inputs into the graft from the host.
To determine whether the ability to extend axons in vivo is a property expressed by stem
cells derived from different human sources, we also tested the Harvard University
Embryonic Stem cell 7 (HUES7) line (Cowan et al., 2004). HUES7 cells were neurally
induced (Yuan et al., 2011) and embedded in the same growth factor cocktail-containing
matrix, then grafted to sites of spinal cord injury (Suppl. Fig. 7); because this component of
the study was purely anatomical, we used a C5 lateral spinal cord lesion (hemisection) in
which animal care is less difficult. Once again, remarkable numbers of axons extended from
the lesion over very long distances, reaching the brainstem in the rostral direction and the
lumbar spinal cord caudally (Suppl. Fig. 7A–G). In gray matter, these human terminals
abundantly expressed the pre-synaptic marker synaptophysin (Suppl. Fig. 7H).
DISCUSSION
Findings of the present study indicate that neural stem cells can specify sufficient
information to permit extensive, long-distance central nervous system axonal regeneration;
additional experimental manipulation of the inhibitory environment of the adult CNS is not
required to achieve this long-distance regeneration. Moreover, the axon growth arising from
neural stem cells can support functional improvement in the most severe model of spinal
cord injury, complete spinal transection, when co-grafted in a supportive fibrin matrix
containing a growth factor cocktail. Axons extend in large numbers and over remarkably
long distances to form connections with host axons. Indeed, axons grew through white
matter, gray matter, and into ventral roots, grew in high density, and elongated at a rapid rate
of 1–2mm per day even through inhibitory white matter. Moreover, host supraspinal axons
regenerated into the neural stem cell grafts. This reciprocal growth resulted in a five-point
improvement on the BBB scale that reflects recovery of the ability to move all joints of the

hindlimbs. The mechanism of recovery, in contrast to previous studies with neural stem
cells, is functional relay formation, indicated by the abolition of recovery by spinal re-
transection immediately rostral to the lesion. These findings may accordingly represent the
most comprehensive demonstration to date of the ability of novel neural relays to support
functional recovery even after the most severe spinal cord injury (Steward et al., 2003).
Wictorin and colleagues reported in 1990 that early stage human fetal tissue grafted into
partial striatal lesion sites could extend axons for long distances in the mature CNS
(Wictorin et al., 1990). In 1997, Silver and colleagues also supported the concept that
neurons could extend axons through adult CNS tissue over long distances, by grafting adult
dorsal root ganglion neurons to white matter (Davies et al., 1997). However, these neurons
did not extend axons across lesion sites and functional effects were not studied (Davies et
al., 1999). More recently, Gaillard and colleagues reported long-distance extension of GFP-
labeled axons from embryonic grafts placed into cortical lesion sites; this study was
anatomical and lacked functional or circuit analysis (Gaillard et al., 2007). Fischer's group
grafted mixed neuronal and glial restricted precursors to sites of partial spinal cord injury
but reported only modest axonal outgrowth (Lepore and Fischer, 2005), and subsequent co-
administration of growth factors enabled further axonal growth over only short distances of
a few millimeters (Bonner et al., 2011). Previous studies of embryonic stem cell implants to
sites of spinal cord injury used moderate and incomplete lesions, and reported only modest
functional improvements (Cummings et al., 2005) (1–2 points on the BBB scale), with
relatively modest graft survival in the lesion site. The classic embryonic spinal cord grafting
literature (Jakeman and Reier, 1991; Theele et al., 1996; Giovanni et al 1997) used cells of a
similar developmental stage to the rodent donor cells in the present study, but did not
identify the extent to which early stage neurons were capable of extending very large
numbers of axons over extraordinarily long distances in the lesioned adult nervous system;
the improved survival, growth and outcomes in the present study are likely a result of the
use of fibrin matrix and a growth factor cocktail, together with clear identification of cell
fate and projection using the GFP reporter. Indeed, distances traversed by graft-derived
axons in this study exceeded the length of the entire embryonic rat nervous system (Miller et
al., 1998). Findings were not attributable to graft cell fusion with the host, as axons
progressively elongated outward from the lesion over several days, an observation
inconsistent with cell fusion.
Grafts of human neural stem cells exhibited growth that was equally extensive. Two
different human cell sources, including 566RSC cells derived from human embryonic spinal
cord (Johe et al., 1996) and HUES7 cells derived from human ES cells (Cowan et al., 2004;
Yuan et al., 2011), exhibited identical patterns of growth in the injured adult spinal cord
after neural induction. Thus, this growth potential is not cell-specific or species-specific,
suggesting translational potential. Indeed, functional testing of 566RSC cells also revealed
an ability to support extensive functional improvement in a severe SCI lesion.
Conclusion
We report an extensive number, distance and functional impact of axonal outgrowth from
neural stem cell grafts, embedded in fibrin matrices containing growth factors, to sites of
severe spinal cord injury. These findings indicate that properties intrinsic to the early stage
neuron are sufficient to overcome barriers to growth in the adult CNS. There are important
potential clinical implications: treatments were delayed for a clinically practical time frame
of at least one week post-injury, resulted in significant functional improvement, and were
achieved using a human neural stem source already employed in clinical trials for ALS
(Boulis et al., 2011).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Adult female Fischer 344 rats (160–200 g, n=55) and athymic nude rats (T-cell deficient)
(180–200 g, n=12) were subjects of this study. NIH guidelines for laboratory animal care
and safety were strictly followed. Animals had free access to food and water throughout the
study. All surgery was done under deep anesthesia using a combination (2 ml/kg) of
ketamine (25 mg/ml), xylazine (1.3 gm/ml) and acepromazine (0.25 mg/ml).
Transplantation surgeries
Adult female Fischer 344 rats and athymic nude rats underwent T3 complete transection. A
2-mm-long block of spinal cord was cut and removed using a combination of iridectomy
scissors and microaspiration, with visual verification to ensure complete transection
ventrally and laterally. For rat-donor studies, grafting was performed two weeks after T3
transection. Embryonic day 14 (E14) spinal cords from transgenic Fischer 344-Tg (EGFP)
rats, ubiquitously expressing GFP under the ubiquitin C promoter, provided donor tissue for
grafting (Rat Resource and Research Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri).
E14 spinal cord was dissected and dissociated according to the method of Harris et al.
(2007). Dissociated E14 cells were re-suspended in a fibrin matrix (25 mg/ml fibrinogen and
25 U/ml thrombin, Sigma F6755 and T5772) containing growth factors to support graft
survival (Willerth et al., 2007; Grumbles et al., 2009; Kadoya et al., 2009): BDNF (50 μg/
ml, Peprotech, 452-02), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3; 50 μg/ml, Peprotech, 450-03), platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF-AA; 10 μg/ml, Sigma, P3076), insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF-1; 10 μg/ml, Sigma, I8779), epidermal growth factor (EGF; 10 μg/ml, Sigma, E1257),
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 10 μg/ml, Sigma, F0291), acidic fibroblast growth
factor (aFGF; 10 μg/ml, Sigma, F5542), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF;
10 μg/ml, Sigma, G1401), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; 10 μg/ml, Sigma, H9661), and
calpain inhibitor (MDL28170, 50 μM, Sigma, M6690). The graft mixture was microinjected
into the lesion cavity as a 10μl cell suspension and subjects survived another 7 weeks
(n=26). Animals underwent functional testing, electrophysiological assessment and
anatomical analysis and were compared to 6 lesion-only controls. To identify molecular
mechanisms underlying axonal outgrowth from donor cells, 13 additional subjects
underwent lesions and rat neural stem cell grafts, then received either rapamycin (LC
Laboratories, 6 mg/kg of 20 mg/ml solution; n=6 animals) or vehicle (n=7) intraperitoneally
every other day starting two days post-grafting, as previously described (Park et al., 2008).
Animals survived an additional two weeks. An additional 12 subjects underwent lesion and
grafts, and were perfused 1, 2, 3 or 7 days after transplantation (n=3 per time point) to
examine the time course of axonal outgrowth from the lesion site. Two weeks before
perfusion, reticulospinal tract axons were anterogradely labeled by injection of 0.5μl of 10%
biotinylated dextran amine (BDA; MW 10,000, Molecular Probes) into each of four sites
spanning both the right and left gigantocellular reticular nucleus (bregma, 11–12.5 mm;
lateral, 8 mm; depth, 8.2–7.3 mm) (Jin et al., 2002).
For human neural stem cell donor studies, cultured human fetal spinal cord NSCs
(NSI-566RSC), were provided by NeuralStem, Inc. Methods for procuring cells have been
published previously (Johe et al., 1996; Boulis et al., 2011). Briefly, the cervical and upper
thoracic region of an 8-week human fetal spinal cord was dissociated and suspended by
trituration in serum-free, modified N2 medium containing 100 mg/l human plasma apo-
transferrin, 25mg/l recombinant human insulin, 1.56g/l glucose, 20nM progesterone, 100μM
putrescine, and 30nM sodium selenite in DMEM/F12. 10ng/ml FGF2 was added as a
mitogen and cells were serially expanded as monolayer cultures in T175 flasks or 150mm
plates coated with 100μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Johe et al., 1996). FGF2 was added every two

days, and cells were first passaged on day 16. Cells were harvested at each subsequent
passage upon reaching 75% confluence and were stored in liquid nitrogen. They were not
retained after passage 20. For shipping, cells were thawed one day prior to grafting, washed
and shipped overnight to UC San Diego at 2–8°C. Viability exceeded 80% the next day.
Cells expressed GFP under the ubiquitin C promoter, enabling in vivo tracking of cell
survival, differentiation and process outgrowth. Cells were implanted into spinal cord lesion
sites one week after T3 complete transection (N=6 animals) and were compared to lesioned,
ungrafted controls (N=6). Animals survived for 7 weeks and underwent functional testing,
as described above. We also grafted a second human stem cell source. Proliferating HUES7
colonies were cultured on mouse fibroblasts and induced to form embryoid bodies. During
the nestin-positive stage the rosettes were removed, single cell suspensions prepared, and the
CD184+/CD271−/CD44−/CD24+ population of hES-NSCs were FAC-sorted and expanded
in the presence of FGF-2 (Yuan et al., 2011). Cells were embedded in fibrin matrices
containing growth factors as described above, and were grafted into sites of C5 hemisection
in adult female athymic (nude) rats (N=6). Comparison was made to lesioned, ungrafted
controls (N=6). Animals survived for 3 months and were sacrificed for anatomical studies,
as described above. This was a purely anatomical study; functional outcomes were not
examined.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2).
Spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed overnight at 4°C and then transferred to 30% sucrose
for 72 hours. 1.5 cm-long horizontal sections of spinal cords containing the lesion/graft site
were sectioned on a cryostat set at 30μm thickness. Coronal sections from the spinal cord,
rostral and caudal to the T3 lesion/transplant site, were examined. Immunohistochemistry
was performed to assess survival, maturation, integration and outgrowth of grafted neurons
as previously described (Lu et al., 2003). Free-floating sections were incubated with primary
antibodies against jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP; rabbit, Invitrogen @ 1:1,500 or
goat from Chemicon @ 1:1500 to label GFP-expressing neural stem cells); GFAP (mouse
from Chemicon @ 1:1500 or rabbit from Dako at @ 1:1500 to label astrocytes); NeuN
(mouse from Chemicon @ 1:200 to label mature neurons); choline acetyltransferase (ChAT;
goat from Chemicon @ 1:200 to label spinal cord motor neurons and motor axons); MAP-2
(mouse from Chemicon @ 1:10,000 to label mature neurons); ßIII tubulin (mouse from
Chemicon @ 1:500 to label immature and mature neurons), neurofilament (NF; mouse from
Chemicon @ 1:1500 to label axons); serotonin (5-HT; polyclonal antibody from
Immunostar @ 1:20,000 to label raphespinal axons); myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG;
mouse from Chemicon @ 1:200 to label myelin); glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 or 67
(GAD65, goat from RD System, or GAD67, mouse from Millipore @1:1000 to label
gabaergic neurons/terminals); vesicular glutamate transporters 1/2 (vGlut1/2, mouse from
Chemicon @1:1000 to label glutamatergic terminals); synaptophysin (mouse from
Chemicon @ 1:1000 to label presynaptic terminals), Adenomatous Ployposis Coli (APC,
monoclonal antibody from Oncogene @ 1:400 to label oligodendrocytes), phospho-S6
kinase (p-S6, rabbit from Cell Signaling Technology @ 1:200 to label ribosomal protein S6
phosphorylated at serine 235 and 236). Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C, then
incubated in Alexa 488, 594 or 647 conjugated goat or donkey secondary antibodies (1:250,
Invitrogen) for 2.5 hr at room temperature. For nuclear staining, 4&,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) (200 ng/ml) was added to the final wash. BDA-labeled reticulospinal
tract axons were detected by double fluorescent labeling with GFP. After blocking with 5%
donkey serum, every 6th section was incubated with primary antibody directed against GFP
(rabbit) and Alexa 594-conjugated streptavidin (to bind to BDA-labeled reticulospinal tract
axons) overnight at 4°C. After washes, sections were incubated with Alexa 488 conjugated
donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 2.5 hr at room temperature.

For examination and quantification of GFP-labeled axons, light level GFP immunolabeling
was performed in every sixth section incubated overnight at 40C with GFP primary antibody
(rabbit at 1:3000) and then with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:50, Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hr at room temperature.
Diaminobenzidine (0.05%) with nickel chloride (0.04%) were used as chromagens, with
reactions sustained for 10 min at room temperature.
Quantification of neural cell density and axon number
Cellular differentiation was determined by counting individual cells labeled for NeuN,
GFAP or APC within a fixed box size of 1600 × 1200 pixels at 400× magnification within
the graft, divided by the total number of cells per sample box labeled with DAPI. Two
randomly selected fields corresponding to the graft epicenter were counted in each subject
for each label, and all analyses were conducted in a blinded manner. An average of 170, 150
and 92 NeuN-, APC- and GFAP-labeled cells were counted in each of six grafted animals,
respectively, and divided by the mean number of DAPI-labeled nuclei in the sampled field
(a mean of 586 DAPI-labeled nuclei/field). The number of GFP-labeled axons emerging
from a typical graft placed at the T3 transection site was quantified using StereoInvestigator
(MicroBrightField, mbfbioscience.com) as previously described (Rosenzweig et al., 2010).
Briefly, in every 6th sagittal section, a dorsoventral line was drawn 500 μm caudal to the
graft/host interface under 40× magnification. The tissue was then examined under 600×
magnification, and GFP-labeled axons that intersected this line were marked and counted.
The sampling fraction was 8.3%. In addition, GFP axon number was quantified in every 6th
section both rostral and caudal to the graft to study molecular mechanisms of axonal growth
after rapamycin treatment. Lesion margins were determined using GFAP and GFP double
fluorescent immunolabeling, and axons crossing a vertical line in horizontal sections 1, 3,
and 5 mm rostral and caudal to the lesion/graft border were counted at 200× magnification.
Total axon number/subject was estimated by multiplying by the sampling fraction.
Observers were blinded to group identity in all surgical and quantitative procedures.
Semi-quantative RT-PCR
For RT-PCR of NgR1, 500 ng total RNA from E14, P1 or adult spinal cord was used as the
template in a 20 ul reaction with random hexamer priming using the Superscript III kit
(Invitrogen). 1 ul RT product was used in standard PCR with different cycle numbers. PCR
primers: 1)  GAPDH:  TGGAGTCTACTGGCGTCTT,
TGTCATATTTCTCGTGGTTCA; 2) NgR1: AAGAGGGCGTCCTCCGG,
CGGCATGACTGGAAGCT.
Electron microscopy
Electron microscopic analysis of synapse formation and myelination was performed
according to the methods of Knott et al. (2009). Briefly, two rats with T3 complete
transections that received rat neural stem cell grafts were perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde plus 0.25% glutaraldehyde (survival time three months), and spinal cord
parenchyma 2mm caudal to the lesion/graft site was sectioned in the coronal plane, then
immunolabeled for GFP with Diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nickel chloride. Sections were
then post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, embedded in Durcupan resin, and
sectioned at 60 nm thickness. Individual GFP-labeled axons or axonal terminals were
located and assessed using a FEI 200KV Sphera microscope at the UCSD CryoElectron
Microscopy Facility.

Electrophysiology
Descending transmission of electrical activity through grafts was assessed using previously
described techniques (Bradbury et al., 2002). In brief, a bipolar stimulating electrode,
consisting of a pair of 85 μm tungsten microelectrodes (0.5 MOhm, WPI, Inc.) spaced 1 mm
apart, was lowered 300–500 μm into the cord at the C7 spinal segment. Brief (0.1 msec)
square wave pulses were delivered at 3–5 second intervals and responses were averaged
over 40 trials. Field responses were recorded using a 1 mm diameter silver ball electrode
placed (i) at T6, three segments caudal to the graft (see Fig. 6b). Confirmation of electrical
transmission through the graft was confirmed by re-transecting the cord immediately above
the graft, and by applying kynurenic acid (50 mM in ACSF) to the graft at the T3 segment.
Functional analysis
The BBB open field 21-point locomotion rating scale (Basso et al., 1996) was assessed
weekly by two independent observers blinded to group identity.
Statistical Analysis
In all quantification procedures and behavioral analyses, observers were blinded to the
nature of the experimental manipulation. Multiple group comparisons were made using one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA; JMP software) at a designated significance level of
95%. Two-group comparisons were tested by Student's t-test. Data are presented as mean ±
SEM.

Figure 2. Extensive Long-Distance Axonal Outgrowth from Neural Stem Cell Grafts
(A) GFP and NeuN immunolabeling reveals that GFP-expressing neural stem cell grafts
robustly extend axons into the host spinal cord rostral and caudal to the T3 complete
transection site (caudal shown) over the 12mm length of the horizontal section. Extensive
regions of the host spinal cord contain graft-derived projections in white matter and gray
matter. Inset shows that GFP-labeled projections arising from grafts express neurofilament
(NF), confirming their identity as axons. (B) Light-level GFP immunolabeling also clearly
reveals the density and distribution of axons extending from the lesion site. Boxes are shown
at higher magnification in C, D. (C) Dense numbers of GFP-labeled axons are present in
host white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) 2mm caudal to the lesion, and (D) large
numbers of axons remain at the end of the block of tissue, 6mm caudal to the lesion. (E) A
high density of GFP-labeled axons is present in the lateral portion of C8, three spinal
segments above the lesion, and (F) remain detectable at C4, 7 spinal segments above the
lesion. Asterisk indicates locations of higher magnification view. (G) GFP-labeled axons
also extend in dense numbers caudally to T6 white matter and gray matter (shown) and (H)
caudally to L1. Overall, axons extend at least 25 mm in each direction. Scale bar: A–B, 600
μm; B–C, 40 μm; D–G, 10 μm. Also see Figure S3 and S4.

Figure 5. Functional and Electrophysiological Improvement after T3 Complete Transection
(A) Hindlimb locomotion: BBB scores after T3 complete transection show significant
improvement in subjects that received neural stem cell grafts (NSC, n=6) compared to
lesioned controls (n=6). Re-transection (arrow, Re-T) at rostral interface of graft with host
abolishes functional improvements when assessed one week later (**p<0.01, ***p<0.001).
Data are represented as mean ± SEM. (B) Electrophysiological transmission across the T3
complete lesion site: (i) In intact animals, stimulation at C7 evoked a short latency (~3.0
msec), large amplitude response at T6. (ii) Transection of the cord at T3 completely
abolished this response. (iii) In 4 of 6 lesion/grafted animals, recovery of an evoked
response of prolonged latency (~5.5 msec) was observed. (iv) Re-transection of the spinal
cord at T3, just rostral to the graft (green arrow), abolished the recovered evoked response.
(C) Kynurenic acid (50 mM), a blocker of excitatory synapses, was applied to the graft to
determine whether excitatory transmission across synapses in the graft was required to
detect responses at T6. Indeed, kynurenic acid application substantially reduced the
amplitude but not the latency of the evoked response. Also see Figure S6.

Figure 6. Human Neural Stem Cell Grafts in Fibrin Matrices after T3 Transection: Long-
Distance Axonal Growth, Connectivity and Functional Improvement
(A) GFP-expressing 566RSC human neural stem cells (NSCs) survive and completely fill
T3 complete transection site, 7 weeks post-grafting (GFP, green; GFAP, red). (B) GFP and
NeuN labeling reveals that many grafted human neural stem cells express mature neuronal
markers. Field is from graft center. (C–E)GFP-expressing human neurons robustly extend
axons into the host spinal cord caudal and rostral to the complete T3 transection site (caudal
shown). Axons extend through both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM). (F) GFP-
labeled human axon terminals express human-specific synaptophysin (hSyn) in host gray
matter. Site shown is 7 mm caudal to lesion. Scale bar: A, 500 μm; B, 10 μm; C, 600 μm;
D–E, 60 μm; F 3 μm. (G) There is significant functional improvement after human NSC
grafts to sites of T3 complete transection (**p<0.01). Re-transection (arrow, Re-T) at rostral
interface of graft completely abolishes functional recovery assessed one week later,
indicating that host inputs are required to improve function. Data are represented as mean ±
SEM.

Figure 7. Dense Axonal Outgrowth from Implants of Human 566RSC Neural Stem Cells
(A) Very large numbers of GFP-labeled axons extend into host spinal cord rostral to T3
transection site, 7 weeks post-grafting. C8 segment shown. (B–C) GFP-labeled axons are
present in C6 and C4 white matter, five and seven spinal segments above the lesion,
respectively. Asterisks indicate location of higher magnification views. (D–F) GFP-labeled
axons also extend in high density caudal to T6 and T9, and are present in both white matter
(WM) and gray matter (GM, dashed lines indicate interface). (F) Axons continue to extend
caudally to L1. Overall, axons extend at least 25 mm in each direction in all subjects. Scale
bar: 15 μm.
