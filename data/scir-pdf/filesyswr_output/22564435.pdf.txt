The regenerative medicine techniques that are beginning to be applied to the nervous system have led to
increased hope in the treatment of diseases that have been considered incurable and that require
experimental models on which to test new therapeutic strategies. We present our experience with adult
pigs (minipigs) that have undergone a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) experimental model, and that
have been followed for 1 year. We describe the surgical aspects of our SCI model by acute compression
and also describe protocols for daily care and rehabilitation that are necessary to maintain the paraplegic
pigs in good health during the months following the injury. Furthermore, we provide in detail the main
complications that arise with this experimental model and the treatments used to address these
complications. Suitable housing conditions, daily rehabilitation and prevention of complications (i.e.,
taking the same care applied to patients following SCI) are essential for achieving the absence of
mortality and long-term maintenance of the animals. We consider the model that is described here to be
feasible and useful for preliminary testing of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at regeneration of the
injured spinal cord in paraplegic patients.

M. Zurita et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 97 (2012) 288–303 289experimental animals, mainly rodents, have been mostly aimed at
increasing the low capacity of the central nervous system (CNS) to
regenerate after damage. In upper mammals, this low capacity for
regeneration is due in part to the apparent inability of the CNS to
induce spontaneous axonal regeneration in the area of injury
(Ramón y Cajal, 1991; Goldberg and Barres, 2000). This is possibly
due to an inhibitory microenvironment that is partly attributed to
glial cells (Schwab et al., 1993; Ridet et al., 1997; Fournier and
Strittmatter, 2001; Morgenstern et al., 2002; Zhao and Liu, 2004).
Since 1940, some publications have described transplants of
various neural tissues, such as the peripheral nerve, nodosum
ganglia or brain tissue, in attempts to restore anatomical
continuity in the sectioned spinal cord (Brown and McCough,
1947; Barnard and Carpenter, 1950; Kao et al., 1977; David and
Aguayo, 1981). In recent years, despite the technical difficulties of
such models, there has been increasing interest in this field of
research. This increased interest coincides with the hope that is
offered by modern techniques of cell therapy (Chopp et al., 2000;
Hofstetter et al., 2002; Fraidakis et al., 2004; Ohta et al., 2004; Parr
et al., 2007; Zurita et al., 2008; Vaquero and Zurita, 2011).
clinical practice, because contusion is the underlying cause in 49%
of paraplegic patients (Potter and Saifuddin, 2003).
The compression model of SCI is used as an alternative to the
contusion model. In the compression model, a continuous force is
applied to the spinal cord over a period of time. This model,
originally described by Tarlov (1957), involves placing an inflatable
balloon in the extradural space; the balloon is inflated acutely or at
set intervals of time. One variation on this model is the application
of an aneurysm clip to the spinal cord, which produces an acute
compression injury of varying severity, depending on the time that
the clip is applied and the force applied by the clip (Rivlin and
Tator, 1978; Joshi and Fehlings, 2002a,b).
When a researcher aims to work with an experimental model of
SCI, it is important to establish the time period from when the
injury takes place until when the treatment in question is applied.
Therefore, we must distinguish chronic phase studies (Zurita and
Vaquero, 2004, 2006; Fraidakis et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2007; Muñoz-
Quiles et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2010; Gelain et al., 2011; Dulin et al.,

1. Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a clinical entity that has been known
since antiquity. SCI has great importance both medically and
socially, as it represents a major cause of disability with serious
personal and family consequences. Trauma causes 70% of SCI cases.
Each year, there are 50 new SCI cases per million people. SCI mostly
affects people under 40 years of age and is associated with
mortality rates that vary between 5% and 20%, depending on the
spinal cord level of the lesion (Rodrı́guez-Boto and Vaquero, 2009).
In recent decades there has been a breakthrough in the
treatment of patients with SCI, mainly in regard to the prevention
of complications. However, although there are many open lines of
research in this field, there is still no effective treatment that leads
to the full functional recovery of patients, whose deficits are
generally permanent and irreversible (Ridet et al., 1997; Silver and
Miller, 2004; Esclarin de Ruz, 2010).
It is therefore understandable that one of the most important
challenges in the field of neurosurgery is the search for new
strategies for the treatment of traumatic SCI. This requires the
development of animal models in which to test possible
treatments that will subsequently be applied to humans (Blesch
and Tuszynski, 2009). In these animal studies, the initial aim is to
demonstrate safety and then efficacy.
There is a large body of literature on SCI, from the studies of
Ramón y Cajal (1914) to the present day. These studies ofations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 295

2. Models of SCI
Most research on traumatic SCI has been performed on adult
rats because these animals are easy to handle. With regard to the
severity of the injury, numerous studies have been done on models
of incomplete SCI. In studies of incomplete lesions there are fewer
problems with achieving the survival of the animals. However, the
effectiveness of different treatments is more difficult to determine
because spontaneous recovery can occur in rats with incomplete
lesions (Li et al., 1998; Takami et al., 2002; Verdú et al., 2003; Bravo
et al., 2004; Gorska et al., 2007, 2009). Therefore, some researchers
study complete SCI. These studies generally focus on the thoracic
level because it is an area where experimental and clinical studies
showed that the possibility of some degree of spontaneous
functional recovery is poor (Ramsey et al., 2010; Harrop et al.,
2011). However, complete paraplegia models are clearly much
more complex, especially with regard to postoperative care and
monitoring of animal evolution.
To advance our understanding and to uncover possible cures of
SCI, it is important to develop an experimental model that is able to
reproduce the effects of acute and chronic SCI in humans. The
literature shows different experimental models of traumatic SCI
that differ in the nature of the injury-causing agent. The contusion
model, in which a weight generates a measurable and reproducible
acute compressive force on the spinal cord, is one of the most
widely used (Allen, 1911). This model is applicable to human
M. Zurita et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 97 (2012) 288–303290Zhao et al., 2011), in which the animal is subjected to treatment
within hours or days after the injury.
The long-term survival of animals is a priority when trying to
assess functional recovery, as a long follow-up period may allow
more time for the development of effective axonal regeneration.
With short periods of evolution, the absence of functional
responses may simply be due to a lack of time (Lu and Ashwell,
2002; Lu et al., 2002). However, chronic models are rarely used,
because the maintenance of paraplegic animals to reach a state of
chronicity involves a great deal of special care. Studies in the
literature rarely list in detail the basic care that must be performed
daily (Santos-Benito et al., 2006; Ramsey et al., 2010). Furthermore,
none of these studies makes a special mention of the rehabilitation
of paraplegic animals, an aspect that we consider extremely
important for progress in this field of research. In our opinion, it is
necessary to establish protocols that reflect the specific rehabili-
tation exercises that are required for chronically paraplegic
animals to prevent complications, especially of the skin, joints
or muscles.
The limited information in the literature on this subject may be
due to the fact that, in most studies, SCI animals are subjected to
different therapies very soon after the lesion (Carvalho et al., 2008).
In this situation, the degree of muscle and joint deterioration is
much lower than in the case of animals with a long evolution time
after injury.
It is possible that the lack of detailed protocols for long-term
paraplegic animals, especially with regard to basic care and
rehabilitation, has contributed to the lack of studies of chronically
established paraplegia models. Moreover, models of traumatic SCI
in adult upper mammals are scarce. Most of these studies have
been done in primates in an acute phase after SCI; these studies
usually have very short periods of evolution. In order to apply new
therapies to humans, it is clearly desirable to know the potential
effectiveness of these therapies on upper mammals (Deng et al.,
2005; Santos-Benito et al., 2006; Rosenzweig et al., 2009; Brock
et al., 2010). Theoretically, primates are excellent candidates due
to their proximity to humans, but the ability of these animals to
use their upper limbs makes housing and long-term care difficult.
In primates it is difficult to maintain urinary catheters or
incontinence pads and to perform skin care and healing of
pressure ulcers. The alternative is to restrict their movements and
keep them in cages, but this leads to a clear decline in their quality
of life. Moreover, although some authors have applied active
rehabilitation to primates suffering incomplete spinal cord
lesions (Babu et al., 2007), the application of rehabilitation
techniques to primates with complete paraplegia is often reduced
to passive exercises; this therapy is far from the rehabilitation
protocols that have been developed in humans with SCI. Although
some patterns of care in upper mammals have been reported
(Santos-Benito et al., 2006; Piedras et al., 2011) descriptions in the
literature are scarce, possibly due to the difficulty of these
experimental models. Furthermore, it should be noted that many
research centers do not have regulatory approval for the housing
of primates.
During the last 20 years in our laboratory, we have gained
experience with cell therapy protocols for the treatment of adult
rats suffering traumatic SCI. We have used a model of chronically
established paraplegia along with long-term maintenance of
animals (up to 18 months of evolution). With this model, we
demonstrated that paraplegic rats could obtain functional recovery
several months after intralesional transplantation of stromal cells
from bone marrow (Zurita and Vaquero, 2006), a finding that was
later confirmed by other authors (Alexanian et al., 2010; Kishk
et al., 2010; Pal et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011). However, before
considering the application of these techniques to humans, it is
necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of such treatments inupper mammals. The functional organization of the rodent nervous
system is less complex than that of the human nervous system, and
therefore the success of a treatment in rodents raises questions
about its potential efficacy in paraplegic patients. For this reason,
in the last 10 years we have developed a model of traumatic SCI in
the adult pig (minipig) to obtain long-term survival after the
administration of cell therapy in these animals. The choice of a
model of complete paraplegia is due to the fact that incomplete SCI
in upper mammals can make it difficult to evaluate the results of
any treatment. As in rodents, the spinal cord of upper mammals
retains some plasticity when the lesion is incomplete, and this may
result in spontaneous recovery (Tuszynski et al., 2002a,b; Fouad
et al., 2004; Rosenzweig et al., 2010). Our model is feasible,
allowing for adequate rehabilitation of paraplegic animals, and it is
extremely useful for demonstrating long-term efficacy in chroni-
cally established paraplegia. Moreover, the adult pig is an animal
that is commonly used for organ transplantation research. Some
studies on pigs subjected to SCI have been reported, but these
studies have focused on acute stages and with short follow-up
times (Meylaerdts et al., 2000; Kuluz et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2010;
Zahra et al., 2010).
3. The chronic paraplegic pig model
Our present work is the result of experience gained with the
first model in the literature of chronically established paraplegia in
the adult pig. The model was designed in our laboratory for testing
cell therapy strategies prior to a possible use of these techniques in
humans. The 20 consecutive animals that form the basis of this
study underwent complete SCI and were followed for 1 year
without mortality. Our goal has been to confirm the feasibility of
the chronic paraplegic pig model and to study possible complica-
tions and their resolutions. The only criterion we have considered
to exclude an animal to be a candidate for this model is the absence
of complete paraplegia. In all cases we have followed a consistent
protocol for care after the injury, which has allowed us to attain the
conclusions and recommendations that we describe below.
3.1. Housing of animals before SCI
For this type of study it is appropriate to use female adult
minipigs weighing 15–20 kg. This allows for better management in
the daily care and rehabilitation processes without causing
problems for overweight animals.
It is important that animals be housed in a housing area
dedicated solely to them for at least 4 weeks before being
subjected to SCI. This ‘‘adjustment period’’ before SCI minimizes
stress and produces more reliable data (Obernier and Baldwin,
2006). During this time, the minipigs not only become accus-
tomed to the facility where they will live, but they are also able to
socialize with the people who will be responsible for their care.
This greatly facilitates subsequent handling, as the animals show
significantly reduced stress and exhibit greater collaboration in
rehabilitation (Yelvington et al., 1985). During this period, the
animals become familiar with the various rehabilitation exer-
cises; we are also able to perform functional tests at this time, such
as blood, urine, or evoked potentials studies, to be used as
reference values (Table 1).
We believe it is advisable not to work with more than 3–4
animals at a time. Given the complexity of care, working with more
animals would not allow us to adequately perform all rehabilita-
tion protocols unless we were to have access to more human
resources and larger installations. Our minipigs are housed in a
room of 40 m2 (Fig. 1) that has cycles of 12 h light/dark, controlled
temperature (24 8C) and controlled humidity (55–65%), and
automatic drinkers to supply water ad libitum.
effective in allowing us to gain the cooperation of the paraplegic
animals with respect to their care and especially their rehabilita-
tion.
All protocols described below are based on 20 years of
experience studying a rat model of chronic traumatic paraplegia
and 10 years of experience using this model in minipigs. Moreover,
treatments that have been used for our animals have been adapted
from procedures that have been performed in humans. All
procedures were approved by the Welfare Animal Committee of
our hospital, in accordance with European and Spanish guidelines.
3.2. SCI procedure
The day of SCI, an animal that had not had access to any type of
intake the night before was pre-medicated with intramuscular
ketamine (20 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.2 mg/kg). Anesthesia was
induced with a face mask, through which 5% sevoflurane and
oxygen were administered. The animal was then washed with hot

M. Zurita et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 97 (2012) 288–303 291We installed special cribs in this room for sleeping (Fig. 1b and
c), with automatic water troughs and air mattresses to prevent
pressure sores. The mattresses are protected with impermeable
covers and fitted sheets to prevent staining or biting. We
performed a change of sheets at least once a day for hygienic
reasons. Air mattresses allow the preservation of the integrity of
the skin after injury; once they are made paraplegic, minipigs
move in their cribs with jerky movements and drag their hind legs.
This can cause skin ulcerations due to pressure and friction. Before
surgery and during the adaptation period, the animals slept in cribs
in order to become accustomed to this new situation. During the
day they were free and played throughout the room.
Animals ate an exclusively vegetarian diet alternated with dry
food (SAFE, scientific and engineering animal food) containing
fresh fruits and vegetables. Food was given three times a day
controlling the amount provided to prevent weight problems so
common in these animals (Swindle, 2007).
The room has two video cameras that allow us to monitor the
animals for 24 h a day. We are able to record their movements
continuously and systematically analyze their behavior.

table in the prone position. Then, 20G and 22G teflon catheters
were placed in the ventrolateral ear vein and the central ear artery,
respectively. The arterial catheter was connected to a calibrated
pressure transducer for direct arterial measurement of blood
pressure (BP), and self-adhering patches were applied to the skin
for electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate recording. The venous
catheter was used for drug administration and for continuous
infusion of lactate Ringer solution (10 mL/kg/h) to avoid hypovo-
lemia in case of excessive bleeding. Once an adequate level of
anesthesia was achieved, a 6-mm internal diameter endotracheal
tube was introduced and secured, and its cuff was inflated.
Urethral catheterization was performed with a 6F or 8F Foley
catheter bladder. Then, the animal was placed in the lateral
position on its right side. After cleaning the surgical area with
povidone-iodine and waiting 3 min, a waterproof, transparent
15  28-cm2 film dressing (Opsite post-op1, Smith & Nephew,
Barcelona, Spain) was placed on the skin.
A laminectomy was performed at the Th12–L1 vertebral level,
and a 4-cm length of spinal cord was exposed. SCI was caused by
the epidural application of two surgical Heifetz’s clips for 30 min
(Fig. 2). In our experience, after this period of acute spinal cord
compression, there is complete and irreversible paraplegia in 100%
of animals (Zurita et al., 2008). If, during the course of the lesion
(placing or removing the clip), the dura tears, it must be repaired
using 6/0 sutures (Prolene 10/0; Ethicon EH111HE, Edinburgh) to
avoid the risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula after surgery. A
sheet of polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore1-Preclude1 Dura Substi-
tute, W.L. Gore & Associates Inc., Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) was
Fig. 2. Surgical field obtained in the course of SCI procedure showing spinal cord
compression by two Heifetz clips.
M. Zurita et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 97 (2012) 288–303292placed over the lesion site to prevent scarring of connective tissue
(Kurt et al., 2009). Although arachnoidal reaction with the use of
epidural polytetrafluoroethylene in pigs has been reported (Haq
et al., 2005), it is a non-absrorbable material that placed epidurally
in our experience not cause significant epidural scarring and
facilitates a new approach to the spinal cord (Vaquero et al., 1999).
The paraspinal musculature and subcutaneous tissues were
subsequently closed with 3/0 absorbable sutures. Finally, chlor-
hexidine gluconate 1% was applied to the skin. The wound was
covered with a hydrofiber dressing (Aquacel1 Ag, ConvaTec. Inc.
USA), which was secured with an adhesive bandage (Elastomull1
haft, Smith & Nephew, Barcelona, Spain).
During the course of surgery, anesthesia with sevoflurane in
oxygen (2 L/min) was maintained using a small animal anesthetic
circle system connected to a volumetric ventilator. Neuromuscular
block with intravenous vecuronium (0.2 mg/kg/h) was achieved,
and intravenous morphine (1 mg/kg) was administered for
intraoperative analgesia. In addition, to prevent infection, intrave-
nous cefazolin (30 mg/kg) was administered before the start of
surgery, and this administration was repeated every 12 h for a total
of 4 doses. None of our animals has shown surgical infection.
The ventilator settings were adjusted to maintain an end-tidal
CO2 value of 35–45 mmHg. To achieve this value, the tidal volume
was set at 10 mL/kg body weight and the peak airway pressure was
set at 8–10 cmH2O, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per
minute. Temperature, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and end-
tidal sevoflurane and CO2 concentrations were continuously
monitored during the procedure. Pulse oximetry (SpO2) was
recorded continuously by placing a pulse oximeter in the tail, and
rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at normother-
mia (between 37 and 38 8C) by means of a total temperature
management system.
3.3. Immediate postoperative period: Phase of spinal shock or acute
phase
Immediately after surgery, the pigs were placed in separate
cribs to facilitate the intravenous administration of fluids and
medication. Analgesia was obtained with morphine (1 mg/kg,
intravenous) and meloxicam (1 mg/kg, intramuscular) and was
maintained for three postoperative days. Hydrofiber dressings
should be maintained until the skin sutures are removed 1 week
after surgery.
Animals should be monitored continuously for at least 2 days
after SCI in order to control parameters such as temperature,
weight, behavior, activity, pain, aspect of the surgical wound, heart
rate, BP and diuresis. These parameters serve as indicators of the
animal’s status and allow for the detection of any serious
complications that may occur; the 48 h following the lesion are
critical for the care of animals with severe SCI. This period
corresponds to the start of what is known as ‘‘spinal shock’’ and can
sometimes extend for up to several weeks (Guttmann, 1981;
Roldan, 2002). This period is characterized, in general terms, by
underactivity, flaccidity and areflexia of the voluntary motor
system are seen below the injury site. This situation is maintained
in 100% of our animals throughout the acute phase. We should note
that, during the first week, there is a rapid and progressive atrophy
of the muscles of the lower extremities (Dupont-Versteegden et al.,
1998) that contributes to weight loss. Generally, there is a 10% loss
of weight in the first week, but this loss is expected throughout the
entire acute phase after injury and should not exceed 20%. Any
weight loss in the chronic phase, or weight loss of more than 20% in
this acute phase, should be considered a sign of disease. The second
criterion is total loss of infralesional sensation (100% of cases). The
third criterion is loss of the autonomic system, leading to paralysis
of the bladder with urinary retention (100% of cases) and urinarytract infections (35%), possible ileus (10%), abdominal distension
and constipation (50%) and vasomotor complications with lack of
venous and arterial response. These can cause hypotension (100%)
and even hypothermia (10%). Hypotension is usually due to the
loss of vasomotor tone, causing decreased venous return and
arterial contractility, which lead to vasodilation and decreased
systemic vascular resistance.
3.4. Care during spinal shock and treatment of possible complications
We describe here the care that must be given to the animals at
this phase and the most important complications that may be
encountered.
3.4.1. Fluid intake and hypotension
After surgery, animals are kept in their cribs with oxygen for
several hours if necessary. The venous catheter placed in the ear
vein should continue to supply fluids (Ringer Lactate) for at least
the first 72 h (Fig. 3). At this phase hypotension is a frequent
finding, but given that this is generally not caused by hypovolemia,
but rather by a lack of vascular tone, it is important to avoid
indiscriminate fluid volume overload (Roldan, 2002). In our
experience, under normal conditions, all animals overcome this
situation without the use of alpha-adrenergic drugs to restore
vasoconstriction and systemic vascular resistance. In some cases, if
necessary, animals with severe hypotension can be treated with
vasopressors such as dopamine. This increases heart rate and can
be administered by continuous infusion at a dose of 2–4 mg/kg/
min.
3.4.2. Orthostatic hypotension
Orthostatic hypotension due to lack of response to changes in
position is very common (90% of our cases, with mean systolic BP
between 110 and 120 mmHg). Consequently, during the shock
phase, animal movements are performed slowly and with care to
avoid hypotension. This is especially important when incorporat-
ing a toilet in the cribs and during postural changes. Control of BP
must be maintained throughout the acute phase; if the systolic BP
becomes less than 70 mmHg the animals are less active and vomit.
If this happens (in our experience, this occurred in 2 cases) and it
cannot be resolved with intravenous administration of lactate
Ringer, the animal should be treated with plasma expanders
(dextran), controlling BP and urine output at least every hour. If the
animals vomit, the administration of Metoclopramide can be
effective.
We determine the systolic BP of the animals daily from the
median artery, using a noninvasive method (‘‘doppler method’’).
The first step is to place the cuff around the forelimb. The cuff is
connected to a manometer and a pump for inflation. After applying
gel to the transducer and identifying the artery with a beep, we
inflate the cuff until suprasystolic BP is reached (200–250 mmHg)
and the sound has ceased. We then begin to remove air from the
cuff until the appearance of an audible signal, which indicates
systolic BP. The sleeve should be approximately 30–40% of the
circumference of the limb on which it is placed; a very broad sleeve
underestimates BP, while a very narrow sleeve overestimates BP.
Neonatal and pediatric inflatable cuffs used in humans, with a
diameter ranging between 1 and 8 cm can be used.
3.4.3. Control of body temperature
Malignant hyperthermia (a hereditary disease that arises as a
reaction to certain anesthetics) is one of the most serious problems
that can occur in experimental surgery in pigs (Muir et al., 2003).
Although it is rare to find cases of this disease, it can be fatal.
Hyperthermia appears in the immediate postoperative period (a
few hours after surgery) and consists of a temperature increase
e ea

temperature (>42 8C) but also by tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating
and increased muscle stiffness with spasms. The best treatment
involves the administration of Drantolene1 (2–6 mg/kg intrave-
nous or 20 mg/kg, oral), 100% oxygen, and physical cooling. Anti-
inflammatory drugs may be used as a supportive treatment. The
animal should be lying prone (sternal) in a calm, cool and well-
ventilated environment. In our series we had no case, but we must
be aware of this complication, which cannot be prevented, because
animals are not usually studied from the point of view of genetic
analysis.
On the other hand, the pig has a low body surface area in
relation to body mass, with few sweat glands and poor
thermoregulatory mechanisms, and hyperthermia, which can be
up to 40 8C, represents a frequent complication after surgery. It
occurred in 50% of our animals and has been successfully treated
by administration of Metamizol (1 g intramuscular/8 h).
3.4.4. Prevention of venous thrombosis
To eliminate the risk of venous thrombosis during this phase, all
our animals received low molecular weight sodium heparin 1% as a
prophylaxis (0.04 mL, subcutaneously) every 24 h, similar to that
which is used in humans. If there is thrombophlebitis, with swelling
or edema in a limb, the dose of heparin can be doubled and
buprenorphine can be added (0.1 mg/kg im). Diuretics (furosemide)
can also be used, maintaining bladder catheterization.
In our series, we have only a case of thrombophlebitis, possibly
due to poor management of prophylaxis, and was detected by
redness and swelling of the limb and hyperthermia. It was resolved
in 4 days with the administration of low molecular weight sodium
heparin 1% (0.08 mL, subcutaneously, every 24 h) and buprenor-
phine (0.1 mg/kg im).r vein. (b) Oxygenotherapy. (c) Animals in their cribs after SCI. (d) Removal of blood3.4.5. Gastrointestinal complications
The occurrence of gastrointestinal complications in the acute
phase is relatively common in this experimental model. The
presence of bowel sounds must be verified by abdominal
auscultation to confirm peristalsis; when there is abdominal
distension, this denotes decreased peristalsis (Chen and Nuss-
baum, 2002). If we suspect ileus, animals are subjected to fasting. If
defecation is absent over the course of 48–72 h, we begin
treatment with enemas or oral laxatives. In our studies, we
observed 2 cases (10%) of severe intestinal paralysis with impaired
intake and vomiting. In both pigs this complication was resolved
by the administration of metoclopramide (0.4 mg/kg, three times
daily, orally) and intravenous administration of Ringer lactate. We
observed the reappearance of bowel sounds and feces 48 h after
starting this treatment. In extreme situations, methylsulfate
neostigmine can be used at a dose of 0.25 mg, subcutaneous or
intramuscular, every 6 h for 2 days to encourage the return of
peristaltic activity. In most cases, transient constipation appears,
and it is resolved with rectal administration of glycerin supposito-
ries. Sometimes fecal impaction appears as a result of the sluggish
colon and the involvement of the reflexes that control defecation.
Finally, due to decreasing anal sphincter tone, fecal incontinence
can occur, but it is not important in the bowel habits of these
animals. To prevent these digestive problems, animals must be
maintained during the first 2 days after surgery with a minimum
intake of food, preferably with administration of saline only during
the first 24 h. Later, the administration of a very soft diet (based on
fruit purees) can be started. The food should be administered in
small quantities and its administration should be suspended if
vomiting occurs. Thereafter, if the food is well tolerated, a soft diet
that is rich in fiber should be maintained for at least 1 week after
injury.
identifiable meatus. By contrast, in the male, the urethra is longer
and has a spiral path that makes urinary catheterization virtually
impossible (König, 2004).
3.4.7. Care and complications of the skin
Impaired skin integrity is among the most frequent complica-
tions seen in paraplegic animals, as in humans (McKinley et al.,
1999). The risk of skin lesions (pressure ulcers) is primarily related
to a prolonged decubitus body pressure due to immobility.
However, lesions can also be caused by friction or rubbing,
especially in cribs (Fig. 4). Another possible reason is irritation of
the skin by urine or stool (incontinence ulcers). The best treatment
is prevention; this can be accomplished by daily monitoring of the
skin, mainly in areas of frequent occurrence of pressure ulcers,
such as the sacral region, groin, knee and ankle (O’Connor, 2002;
Kirshblum et al., 2004).
The main guidelines to avoid the appearance of skin ulcers are
as follows: (a) Keep the skin very clean and moisturized by
application of hyper-oxygenated fatty acids (Mepentol1, Bama-
Geve SL, Barcelona, Spain); (b) Inspect the most vulnerable zones
M. Zurita et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 97 (2012) 288–3032943.4.6. Urinary complications
Urinary complications at this stage are also very common.
Voluntary and reflex pathways are abolished, causing paralysis of
the bladder detrusor muscle. Moreover, the internal and external
sphincters are closed, which can lead to bladder distension in first
few hours. Therefore, during spinal shock, the animals should have
a urinary catheter. The catheter should be permanent at first, and
then animals can be subjected to intermittent bladder catheteri-
zation in order to compensate for the lack of automatic bladder
function. This helps to maintain bladder muscle tone and prevents
the accumulation of urine that causes deformation of the detrusor
muscle and hampers further bladder rehabilitation (Zermann et al.,
2000). We use a Foley bladder catheter (No. 6 or No. 8), which is
kept under strict aseptic conditions. When a good catheterization
technique is used, there is no increase in the incidence of urinary
tract infections, and in our series we did not observe complications
in the form of urethral injury, as has been described by some
authors working on models of SCI in primates (Lisenmeyer, 2002;
Piedras et al., 2011).
In our model, suprapubic stimulation and the Crede maneuver
have not been sufficient to resolve urinary retention; bladder
catheterization has always been necessary, at least until bladder
reflex activity is re-established and animals are able to urinate by
overflow. The absence of bladder catheterization during this phase
is related to mortality in 100% of cases.
The catheter should be kept attached to a urine collecting bag
(preferably with a vacuum device that also facilitates the collection
of samples for analysis). In addition, this bag should be protected
by an incontinence diaper, providing additional hygiene and
preventing the loss of the urinary catheter due to movements of
the animals in their cribs. Moreover, a thorough survey of urine
output should be made by observing not only the amount (diuresis
in pigs is 1–1.5 L a day) but also the appearance and smell of the
urine. The observation of these parameters may suggest a presence
of a urinary infection. In the case of a urinary catheter malfunction,
it must be replaced, as it is common to find a sediment blockage.
If possible, intermittent catheterizations of the bladder are
preferable during this period. Hydrophilic catheters should be used
to minimize the risk of bladder trauma and urinary tract infections
(Chartier-Kastler and Denys, 2011).
Possible causes of urinary infections in animal models of
paraplegia are incomplete bladder emptying, resulting in urine
retention, or improper handling of the catheter. In our animals,
urinary infection was detected during the spinal shock phase in
70% of cases and is often manifested by increased spasticity,
fatigue, dark and foul-smelling urine, and sometimes fever. It is
adequately controlled by changing the catheter and oral adminis-
tration of antibiotics for at least a week, according to the results
from urine culture.
On the other hand, occurrence of benign urinary infections is
very frequent (70% of cases) and can be detected by alterations in
the color and odor of the urine. Usually these are not associated
with clear symptoms, and urinary culture is often negative. Given
this situation, the urinary catheter must be changed, and
antibiotics must be administered (ciprofloxacin 20 mg/kg every
12 h for 1 week).
The presence of blood in the urine (hematuria) is relatively
common during the first few weeks after injury (70%) and may
generally be due to urinary tract infection or urinary bladder
distention. In the first case, it disappears rapidly after treatment
with antibiotics; in the second case, it is resolved by placing a
urinary catheter or by replacing an existing catheter that is usually
blocked.
For the pig model of traumatic SCI, female animals should be
used; they offer greater ease in the placement of urinary catheters
because the urethra is short, straight and shows a clearlyon a daily basis; (c) Avoid prolonged immobilization of the animals
(postural changes must be made every 3–4 h) and exercise should
be maintained as long as possible; (d) Alleviate pressure on the
most critical areas of support. If a pressure ulcer appears, its
severity must be determined, and appropriate treatment must be
applied.
In animals, as in humans, we can differentiate the following four
grades of pressure sores (Sopena et al., 2009):
Grade I. It is an ulcer that affects the most superficial layer of
skin (epidermis) and characterized by a defined erythematous
macula, with bright red aspect. Erythema is reversible and after
removal of pressure the skin regains its normal appearance.
This complication is common in paraplegic pigs (100% of
animals). When it is detected, the skin must be kept clean and
adequately moisturized. Avoid massage, rubbing or friction as
much as possible.
Grade II. It is an ulcer with partial loss of skin (epidermis and
dermis or both). This appears as an abrasion surface and
presents a high risk of infection. The skin does not recover its
original appearance after removal of the pressure. This
complication was observed in 20% of our animals. It was
treated by cleaning the wound with a saline solution. In
addition, the skin should be protected to prevent bacterial
contamination.

the injury and can even reach a state of hyperreflexia. The
appearance of reflexes coupled with an increase in bladder tone
often serves as an indicator of the onset of the chronic phase. From
this time the management of the paraplegic pigs must be in
accordance with the following guidelines:
3.6.1. Control of food and management of digestive complications
In this phase animals receive special dry vegetarian food
(Scientific Animal Food and Engineering, Panlab, Barcelona, Spain)
to prevent constipation and excessive weight gain. The food is
administered three times a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and
supplemented with fruits and vegetables that are usually offered
during rehabilitation. During the chronic phase there should be no
major gastrointestinal complications if the animals take a proper
diet and if water intake is controlled (water intake should be
abundant), but the frequency and type of defecation must still be
monitored.
3.6.2. Control of diuresis and urinary tract infections
Daily urine output should be monitored (color, turbidity and
volume). At least one strip test a week (Urine strip 10C, Dialab
Diagnostics, Hondastrasse, Austria) should be taken to determine
some general biochemical values such as pH, leukocytes, glucose,
proteins, etc. However, a complete biochemical study should be
performed at least once per month. In the first weeks of the chronic

tissue but does not affect the adjacent fascia. A blackish,
necrotic area indicates that the tissue is dead. In the presence of
these lesions, one should wash the wound, debride necrotic
tissue and protect the skin with semipermeable dressings
(hydrogels, hydrocolloids, alginates or polyurethane film,
according to the exudate) to prevent infection. In our series
these lesions appeared in one case (5%).
Grade IV. These lesions are characterized by extensive destruc-
tion, with tissue necrosis to muscle, bone or supporting
structures, and can lead to death if they are complicated by
serious infections (osteomyelitis or septic arthritis) which can
lead to generalized sepsis by germs that enter the bloodstream.
The wound need to be cleaned, and it is also necessary to
debride necrotic tissue and protect the skin with semiperme-
able dressings (hydrogels, hydrocolloids, alginates or polyure-
thane films, according to the exudate) to prevent infection. We
did not observe grade IV ulcers in our present series. On the
other hand, we found no self-harm of the skin or self-mutilation
of the lower limbs, as has been described by some authors in
rodents and monkeys (Levitt and Levitt, 1981; Piedras et al.,
2011).
Given the absence of previous experience in the literature on
chronic models of paraplegia in adult pigs, there are no
descriptions of self-aggressive behavior of these animals. However,
these animals may bite each other’s incontinence pads during
periods of play and may cause injury to the anal area from a lack of
sensitivity (1 case, 5%). We resolved this situation by using cotton
underwears to cover incontinence pads.
3.5. Housing conditions in the immediate post-operative period
In the immediate postoperative period, special care is taken
with paraplegic animals to ensure their welfare, representing an
adaptation of that which is used in human clinical practice (Table
2).
After surgery (spinal shock phase), the animals remain in cribs
all day and undergo postural changes every 3–4 h. After 2 weeks, if
there are no major complications, pigs gradually begin to undergo
the rehabilitation protocols described below. Rehabilitation starts
gradually; when rehabilitation is begun, animals are only in their
cribs to sleep for 12 h during the night. For hygienic reasons,
animals are maintained at all times with incontinence pads (to
which they readily adapt) and are changed every 4 h. At the time of
each change we cleaned the perianal area with soapy water
(following extensive washing) or with baby wipes to keep the skin
clean. Hyperoxygenated fatty acids are then administered for
protection and hydration of the skin. During the day, when animals
are not in rehabilitation and when their physical condition permits,
the animals are kept free in wheelchairs specially adapted for them
(Fig. 5). These chairs allow animals to be positioned on all limbs, at
least for certain time intervals, and permit independent movement
for playing and relaxing during leisure time. Adaptation to
wheelchairs must be slow and gradual to allow the animals to
acclimate to their new situation and so that they can learn to move,
at first with assistance from caregivers. In our experience, pigs
adapt to the chair in around 4–5 days.
3.6. Care and possible complications in the chronic phase
During the acute phase after SCI there is a complete loss of
sensory and autonomic function, as in other species, but this is not
a permanent state. Autonomic reflexes begin to appear after
several weeks. Paralysis, while flaccid at first, becomes spastic in
some cases. This is a result of an increase in tone below the level ofTable 2

activities are not performed on the stage of spinal shock (see text).

remain with a urinary catheter, the functioning of the catheter
must be controlled. When in doubt, it should be washed with 0.9%
saline to avoid infections or other urinary complications. However,
it is advisable to maintain intermittent catheterization for at least
the first 2 months to allow for the safe recovery of bladder
automatism. During this time, bladder retraining techniques
should be applied. Suprapubic massage can be used and, if needed,
bladder emptying can be achieved by the Valsalva or Credé
maneuvers.
One of the most common complications in the chronic phase is
urinary infection, so we subjected our animals to prolonged
treatment with a prophylaxis (1 month of treatment, another break
and then a new treatment for 1 month) using fosfomycine, 1 g
orally every 48 h. Despite this prophylaxis, we continued to
monitor the existence of signs and symptoms that may indicate the
presence of a urinary infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often
detected but should not be treated, to prevent development of
resistance (Lisenmeyer, 2002). When an obvious urinary infection
is detected (20% of cases), it is almost always solved by the oral
administration of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 20 mg/kg/12 h for 7
days.
3.6.3. Care of the skin
The risk of skin lesions is primarily related to the immobility of
the minipigs, especially in the crib. Together with urinary tract
problems, skin lesions are some of the most frequent complica-
tions during the chronic phase. Although the animals at this stage
remain in cribs for a short time, daily monitoring of the skin must
be continued. The skin must be cleaned and moisturized. In
addition, at this stage care must be taken with wheelchairs and
other rehabilitation equipment, pressure points must be avoidedon certain body areas. At this stage we found that 10 animals
developed a grade I ulcer (50%) on the tuberosity of the ischium,
and 2 animals developed a grade II ulcer (10%) that was caused by
pressure from the wheelchair on the femoral condyle.
3.6.4. Spasticity
Spasticity occurs in the chronic phase of the injury as an
increase in muscle tone and an exaggerated increase in reflex
activity that is associated with involuntary movements (spasms) in
the muscles below the injury. The appearance of mild spasms was
observed in virtually all of our animals in the chronic phase, but
only one animal (5%) experienced disabling spasticity. The intense
rehabilitation to which our animals were subjected was likely able
to prevent a higher incidence. Only one animal developed severe
spasticity, which was associated with significant deformities and
contractures of the lower limbs. In this case, spasticity was not
followed by pain; it was treated with baclofen at a dose of 1 mg/kg
(daily, oral) and improved partially.
To assess the degree of spasticity in animals, we used two
assessment scales that are used in humans: the PENN scale (Penn
et al., 1989) and the modified Ashworth scale (Ashworth, 1964)
3.6.5. Autonomic dysreflexia
Autonomic dysreflexia usually results from increased BP that
cannot be compensated for due to dysfunction of the autonomic
nervous system. It usually appears in high lesions of the spinal cord
and presents with episodes of BP that fluctuates from very high to
very low. Animal model studies have been conducted to determine
the effects of dysreflexia as well as the changes in the spinal cord
that contribute to the development of this disorder. However, the
mechanism underlying autonomic dysreflexia is poorly under-
stood (Weaver et al., 2006; Alan et al., 2010).
In our experience, with SCI at a relatively low spinal level, we
found no cases of severe autonomic dysreflexia. However, this
complication can appear as a consequence of urinary retention,
infection or even a change of position, as has been described by
some authors (Jacob et al., 2001; Hagen et al., 2011). In the
presence of this complication, the animal’s head must be raised
using pillows, and the noxious stimulus must be removed (usually
bladder distention). If the animal has a bladder catheter, its
permeability must be confirmed. Persistent dysreflexia can be
treated with antihypertensive agents such as nifedipine at a dose of
0.2 mg/kg oral, three times a day (Campagnolo and Merli, 2002).
3.6.6. Neuropathic pain
Neuropathic pain can occur within hours, days, weeks or even
many months after SCI and is variable in intensity. It is not
common in complete thoracic lesions but is more frequent after
incomplete injuries (Bockenek and Stewart, 2002). This complica-
tion must be addressed in a preventive manner, so our animals
received analgesia in the first days after the injury. We
subsequently carried out extensive monitoring to look for clinical
signs of pain. If we observed any signs of pain (changes in behavior
or vocalizations), we quickly administered analgesic treatment
(Henke and Erhardt, 2004). The drugs used were as follows:
morphine intravenous, 0.1 mg/kg every 4 h; buprenorphine 0.01–
0.02 mg/kg intravenous or intramuscular every 8–12 h (treatment
of choice); tramadol hydrochloride 1–3 mg/kg/h for 2 h intrave-
nous; meloxican, 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneous or intravenous every
24 h. This can cause loss of appetite and vomiting. Therefore, when
it is used it should be administered with a protector of the gastric
mucosa.
The signs that an animal is in pain are diverse and may manifest
as follows: cessation of eating or movement, avoidance of contact
with caretakers, aggression or even self-mutilation. There may be
vocalization, loud exhalations, or grinding of theeths. To assess the
degree of pain in animals, different scales may be used. We use the
scale described by Haskins (Haskins, 1992a,b) which divides the
degrees of pain as follows: (a) mild pain is a tolerable pain that
does not involve changes in animal behavior and that is only
expressed as a certain defensiveness when handling body parts; (b)
moderate pain is a more intense pain that can be produced by
disease and can lead to significant changes in behavior, such as
reduced activity, or appetite; and (c) severe pain is a pain that
involves major changes in behavior and is accompanied by
vocalizations (moaning, grunting, etc.), aggressive or self-mutila-
tion.
In our series of 20 animals we did not find any animal in a phase
of chronic paraplegia showing signs of pain. The extensive
rehabilitation that takes place in these animals may prevent pain,
but when in doubt, analgesics should always be administered. 2/3 distal. The measurement should always be conducted in the

M. Zurita et al. / Progress in Neurobiology 97 (2012) 288–303 2973.7. Housing conditions in the chronic phase
During maintenance of the animals in the chronic phase, the
pigs only remain in their cribs to sleep for 12 h per night. The
minipigs, for reasons of hygiene, remain with incontinence pads at
all times. As in the acute phase, incontinence pads are changed
every 4 h for grooming to keep the skin clean, followed by
administration of hyper-oxygenated fatty acids for protection and
hydration. At this phase, except when our animals are resting or
undergoing rehabilitation, they remain in wheelchairs to allow for
independent movement and so that they can play and relax.
3.8. Neurological examination of the animals in the chronic phase
During the first days after SCI we find a total anesthesia and
hypotonia below the injury site, but muscle tone and reflexes
gradually and moderately increase from the second week.
Neurological examination of animals at least once a week is
necessary to assess possible changes.
The scales used to evaluate animals with SCI are as follows: (a)
Motor function scale (Zurita et al., 2008), which refers to purely
motor aspects (Table 3); (b) Modified SCI Neurological scale (Kuluz
et al., 2010), which not only assesses the sensory and motor
function of the lower extremities but also emphasizes bladder and
bowel function (Table 4); and (c) Walking porcine scale (Kuluz
et al., 2010), which is an adaptation of the BBB scale (Basso et al.,
1995) from rodents to minipigs, to assess the locomotor function of
animals (Table 5).
To assess the degree of muscle atrophy and the state of joints,
it is necessary to measure muscle mass every week and to
measure the degree of joint motion with a goniometer. To assess
muscle mass, thigh circumference is measured at the following
three levels: (a) greater trochanter; (b) zone sesamoid, and (c)

placing the central point of the goniometer in the center of the
range of joint motion, in both flexion and extension, and
measuring the angle. In the normal state, the angles measured
by the goniometer are (flexion/extension): hip: 50/162; knee: 42/
162; tarsal: 39/164.
3.9. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation
Numerous studies have described the beneficial effects of
intensive rehabilitation treatment in the maintenance and
recovery of patients who have suffered SCI, maximizing preserva-
tion of patients capabilities after injury (Wernig and Müller, 1992;
Wernig et al., 1995; Rodrı́guez-Boto and Vaquero, 2009). It seems
clear that similar approaches should be applied to experimental
animals with SCI because it can facilitate the acquisition of better
functional results (Kunkel-Bagden et al., 1993; Gazula et al., 2004;
Norrie et al., 2005; Carvalho et al., 2008; Macias et al., 2009; Kuerzi
et al., 2010; Robert et al., 2010). Therefore, in our laboratory,
animals with SCI are subjected to a series of daily exercises
designed to keep their joints and musculature in good condition
(Figs. 6 and 7). Although the mechanism of locomotion is very
complex (Grillner, 1975; Grillner and Wallen, 1985; Pearson, 1993;
Jordan, 1998), animals undergoing intense rehabilitation sessions
were able to create useful gait patterns.
3.10. Kinesitherapy: Passive rehabilitation of sublesional joints
The care and affection given to animals must ensure that they
behave as pets (see Supplementary Video 1). This is essential for
proper rehabilitation.
Daily treatment by passive movement of the lower limbs in
paraplegic animals allowed us to accomplish the following: (a)
uluz et al. (2010), and provides an index of overall neurological status, with special
maintain joint tours; (b) prevent the onset of circulatory problems,
favoring venous return; (c) prevent contractures and deformities;
(d) preserve muscle-tendon elasticity; (e) prevent the onset of
pathological ossifications; and (f) reduce the extent of possible
spasticity.
Passive motion of all joints of the lower limb should be
performed on all animals at least twice a day in sessions of about
30 min each. If possible, this should be performed more often in the
acute phase to promote better circulation and to prevent
contractures (Guttmann, 1981). However, passive movements
should be performed based on the following rules: all of the joints
of the affected members must be moved smoothly and slowly,
without straining the joints, and joints must be mobilized in all
planes and axes of movement, reaching the maximum amplitude
of the joint. It is important that the mobilization is performed very
carefully, because animals have no feeling in these areas, which
can lead to tissue damage. One should keep in mind that a possible
cause of pathological ossification is careless mobilization that
traumatizes periarticular tissues and muscles. If we observe
edema, reddish-cyanotic engorgement of superficial veins, or
increased temperature in the hind legs, suggesting thrombophle-
bitis, kinesitherapy must be suspended.
In our present series we observed no cases of pathological
ossification, but in the early periods of our model, we had a case
with severe spasticity after SCI that developed pathologic
ossification in the right knee, preventing effective rehabilitation.
The program of passive exercise that is performed daily on the
lower limbs (first with one limb, then the other) is based on the
work of Alcántara et al. (1995) and consists of the following: (a)
flexion–extension of the hoof (bending and stretching with the

of the scale used by Kuluz et al. (2010). It is useful for assessing limited to the
spontaneous movements in the hindlimbs. The animal is placed on the floor for
20 min, two times a day for the assessment.

We allow the animal to get into the water and always monitor
stress and fatigue. It is important to increase the intensity of
exercise gradually. At the start, two or three sessions per week are
sufficient, but this can become a daily routine. When the animals
treated after the SCI begin to regain motor and sensory function, as
a result of cell therapy in our studies (Zurita et al., 2008; Vaquero
and Zurita, 2011), the water exercises are eventually performed
with the following different water levels daily: 60 cm for 60 min
per day, 40 cm and 25 cm.
3.12. Gait training: Treadmill
Several studies have demonstrated the usefulness of treadmill
gait training in patients with SCI (Wernig and Müller, 1992; Dietz
et al., 1998; Dietz, 2003; Dobkin et al., 2006). Moreover,
experimental studies have shown positive effects not only on gait
but also on the control of neuropathic pain and autonomic

the knee, never the reverse: (c) flexion–extension of the knee and
hip (bending and straightening the knee and hip); (d) circumduc-
tion of the hip (making circles in both directions of the hip with the
knee bent); (e) rotation of the hip; (f) abduction and adduction;
and (g) stretching of muscles in the back of the thigh (Figs. 6a, b, 7
and Supplementary Video 2).
3.11. Hydrotherapy
Hydrotherapy is a technique that is widely used in rehabilita-
tion after SCI, and its effectiveness has been proven not only in
humans but also in experimental models (Hutchinson et al., 2004;
Smith et al., 2006; Magnuson et al., 2009; Robert et al., 2010). This
therapy is useful for strengthening the muscles that have been
affected by the injury; stabilization and flotation in water
facilitates exercises that could not be done on the ground. The
body supports less weight in water and this reduces the load on the
joints, allowing for more comfortable exercise. The use of
hydrotherapy in the injured animals has been very useful for
the following: (a) reducing spasticity; (b) strengthening muscles;
(c) improving the balance of the trunk, and (d) providing play time
in the water.
The pool is maintained with chlorinated water with a
temperature between 27 and 30 8C, with bacteriological testing
to ensure sterility. Animals should have a period of adaptation to
exercising in the water. Initially, the animals must use life jackets
and only passive rehabilitation should be performed (Fig. 6c and
Supplementary Video 2).
Fig. 7. Passive rehabilitation of the different joints. See also Supplementary Video 2.dysfunction (Vilensky and O’Connor, 1998; Thota et al., 2001; Laird
et al., 2009). Studies in rodent models with incomplete injuries
confirmed that daily treadmill exercise allows for a significant
recovery of walking ability (Multon et al., 2003).
In our pig model of SCI, daily exercise on the treadmill allows us
to establish intensive gait training, helping to strengthen the
muscles of the affected limbs and improving the balance of the
trunk (Fig. 6d). To perform this exercise it is necessary to use a
harness system to keep the animal suspended, as after SCI at the
thoracic level, animals can no longer support their body weight and
cannot generate an automatic locomotion pattern. Daily sessions
of 30 min should be performed, in which all of the joints are
passively mobilized following the gait pattern.
3.13. Walker and wheelchair
Recent advances in neurorehabilitation therapy in humans
have shown that daily standing, along with other exercises,
improves muscle, cardiovascular and pulmonary function (Vidal,
2009). In our experimental model, pigs support all limbs daily
using wheelchairs designed specifically for each animal (Fig. 5).
This is conducted in combination with a program of gait training
with a walker that was also designed in our laboratory (Fig. 6e).
3.14. Electrostimulation
Electrostimulation has few indications in our experimental
model. However, it has occasionally been used in attempts to
reduce spasticity, but has met with little success (Fig. 8).
Electrostimulation in animals with complete SCI should be
applied only to major muscles, such as the tibialis anterior and
Fig. 8. Electrical stimulation of muscle mass in a paraplegic animal.
quadriceps. Opinions on the effectiveness of electrical stimulation
on denervated muscle are contradictory, and although the goal is to
maintain muscle tropism (Herbison et al., 1973), some authors
believe that it is generally ineffective. We could not obtain clear
conclusions about its usefulness, but our experience in chronically
paraplegic pigs suggests that electrostimulation delays muscular
atrophy without improvement when atrophy is already present. In
two cases of our series we have used electrostimulation to treat
spasticity or reduce muscle atrophy. We have used an intensity of
80 mA, pulse duration between 200 and 250 ms, and a frequency
range between 30 and 50 Hz. Electrostimulation was applied
20 min/day for 3 months.
3.15. Neuroimaging studies
In the course of various research protocols, our paraplegic
animals have been subjected to neuroimaging studies, usually under
general anesthesia, including isotope scans to study the distribution
of labeled autologous stem cells after systemic administration (De
Haro et al., 2005) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study
the morphological evolution of spinal cord lesion.
In our series, paraplegic pigs were studied by MRI 3 months
after SCI, using a 1.5-T superconducting imager (Siemens SA,
Madrid, Spain), and at this time point, MRI characteristically
showed a cystic centromedullary lesion that was hypointense on
T1 and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Spinal cord atrophy
and myelomalacia were common along with persistent centro-
medullary cysts. The average values for the volume of the
posttraumatic centromedullary cavity, according to the image
reading software (Siemens Imaging software, Siemens AG Medical
Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) were 135  38 mm3 (Fig. 9).
3.16. Electrophysiological studies
Electrophysiological studies in our experimental model allowed
us to obtain objective data to confirm the potential efficacy of our
therapeutic strategies. To assess the integrity of the ascending and
descending tracts of the spinal cord, somatosensory evoked
potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) should
be performed. To conduct both types of tests, the animals must be
anesthetized by induction with sevorane and placed on the
operating table in the prone (sternal) position. PowerLab system
(ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA) was used.
MEPs were recorded using needle monopolar recording
electrodes located in the anterior tibial muscle and plant (at the
third metatarsal space). The stimulus electrodes were located

cathode) and on the skin of the nose (anode). A stimulation train (3
pulses, 200–300 V, 0.1 ms pulse duration, and 2 ms interstimulus
interval) was used (Strauch et al., 2004).
To record SSEPs in response to stimulation of the tibial nerve,
tibial nerve stimulation was performed using AgCl electrodes
(2.17 Hz) 15 mm in length. Electrodes were placed on the tibial
nerve subcutaneously and were separated by 2 cm. For recording,
electrodes were inserted in the contralateral somatosensory
cortical area. Electrical stimulation (0.2 ms duration and 19 mA
intensity) was performed with a constant current range of 2-fold
threshold responses to stimulation of muscles. The signals of the
evoked potentials were amplified (10 mV), filtered (1–3 kHz
bandpass) and fed to a compatible PC to be averaged using Scope
Fig. 10. (a and b) Animals in the course of a neurophysiological study for recordisoftware (Scope Software Ltd., Co. Dun Laoghaire, Dublin, Ireland).
Each measurement consists of an SSEP average of 512 single sweep
epochs. The signals were amplified and filtered (band-pass 1 Hz/
5 kHz for MEPs and 10 Hz/1 kHz for SSEPs) (Fig. 10).
4. Conclusion
In this paper we have described the conditions and procedures
that we used to maintain paraplegic minipigs in good health for
long periods of time after SCI.
Our present results demonstrate that adult paraplegic pigs can
be maintained in good clinical condition for long periods of time if
given proper care. This animal model may help to optimize new
experimental strategies that need sufficient follow-up time to
assess their efficacy, providing an important resource for studies of
regenerative techniques applied to paraplegic patients.
