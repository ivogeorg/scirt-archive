Introduction
Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) preconditioning can induce
ischemic tolerance in both the brain and the spinal cord
(Wada et al., 1996; Prass et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2001; Dong
et al., 2002; Miljkovic-Lolic et al., 2003). The tolerance can be
attenuated by the administration of dimethylthiourea (DMTU),
These results imply that a nonlethal level of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) produced during HBO preconditioning may be a
mediator of the tolerance induction, and that the increased
activity of antioxidant enzymes during HBO may be respon-
sible for the protective effect of HBO pretreatment (Ohtsuki
et al., 1992; Nie et al., 2006). However, it is still unknown
whether ischemic tolerance is a direct effect of HBOReceived 12 April 2006; accepted 19 November 2006
Abstract
Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) preconditioning can induce ischemic tolerance in the spinal cord. The effect can be attenuated by the administration
of an oxygen free radical scavenger or by inhibition of antioxidant enzymes. However, the mechanism underlying HBO preconditioning of
neurons against ischemic injury remains enigmatic. Therefore, in the present study primary cultured spinal cord neurons were treated with HBO
and then subjected to a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) insult. The results show that H2O2 stimulation of the cultured spinal neurons caused severe
DNA damage and decreased cell viability, and that these neurons were well protected against damage after a single exposure to HBO
preconditioning (0.35 MPa, 98% O2, 37 °C, 2 h). The protective effect started 4 h after pretreatment and lasted for at least 24 h. The cultured
neurons after HBO treatment also exhibited increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression at both the protein and mRNA levels, which
paralleled the protective effect of HBO. Treatment with tin-mesoporphyrin IX (SnMP), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, before HBO pretreatment
abolished the HBO-induced adaptive protection noted in the cultured spinal neurons. In conclusion, HBO preconditioning can protect primaryb Department of Aerospace Physiology, School of Aerospace Medicine, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710032, China

www.elsevier.com/locate/lifescie(H2O2)-mediated oxidative injury was produced in the cultured
spinal neurons to simulate the damage induced by ischemia–
reperfusion. The aim of the current study was to determine if
cesHBO preconditioning could induce tolerance against oxidative
injury in primary cultured spinal cord neurons and, if so, to
identify the mechanism for the tolerance induction.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
This study consisted of three experiments. Experiment 1
was designed to investigate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen
preconditioning on oxidative injury in spinal cord neurons.
Experiment 2 was designed to investigate the effect of hyperbaric
oxygen preconditioning on antioxidant enzyme activities in spinal
cord neurons, and experiment 3 was designed to investigate the
effect of SnMP, a specific inhibitor of HO-1 activity, on
antioxidant enzyme activities after HBO preconditioning.
In experiment 1, the primary cultured spinal cord neurons
were randomly divided into three groups: control, H2O2, and
HBO+H2O2 groups. In order to maintain the physiological
power of hydrogen (pH) for 2 h at 37 °C, neurons in the
HBO+H2O2 group were exposed to HBO at 0.35 MPa with a
gas composition consisting of 98% O2 and 2% carbon
dioxide (CO2). As a sham pretreatment, neurons in the H2O2
and control groups were placed in a chamber (21% O2, 2%
CO2), in which the air was not pressurized, on the same
schedule that was used for the HBO+H2O2 group. At various
time points after HBO exposure (0 h, 3 h, 7 h, 11 h, and
23 h), H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was
added into the culture medium of the HBO+H2O2 and H2O2
groups at a final concentration of 50 μM and maintained for
1 h at 37 °C. The neurons of the three groups were assayed
for methyl thiazoleterazolium (MTT) or harvested to detect
DNA damage using the comet assay (single cell gel
electrophoresis) at various time points after HBO exposure
(1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h). Each experiment was repeated
three times (n=3).
In experiment 2, the primary cultured spinal cord neurons
were randomly divided into two groups: control and HBO
groups. Neurons in the HBO group were exposed to HBO
(0.35 MPa, 98% O2, 2% CO2) for 2 h at 37 °C, and those in the
control group received a sham pretreatment as described in
experiment 1. The neurons were harvested after HBO exposure
(at 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h) and examined for changes
related to antioxidant enzyme expression using Western blot or
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Each
experiment was repeated three times (n=3).
In experiment 3, the cultured spinal neurons were randomly
divided into three groups: control, H2O2, and HBO+H2O2
groups as in experiment 1. In the H2O2 and HBO+H2O2
groups, 23 h after HBO exposure, the neurons were subjected to
an H2O2 insult as described in experiment 1. In one half of each
group's wells, the neurons were given SnMP (Alexis, San
Diego, CA, USA) 10 min before HBO exposure at a final
concentration of 10 μM. Ten micromolar SnMP was chosen for
1088 Q. Li et al. / Life Scienthe study since this concentration has been shown to
significantly decrease HO activity (Koeppen et al., 2004;
Suttner et al., 1999). The neurons in the other half of eachgroup's wells were assayed without SnMP pretreatment. The
three groups' neurons were assayed for MTT or harvested to
detect DNA damage using the comet assay 24 h after HBO
preconditioning. Each experiment was repeated three times
(n=3).
Cell culture
Primary culture of spinal cord neurons was done using the
method described by Moreels et al. (2005) with minor
modifications. Briefly, spinal cords from 11- to 14-day-old
fetal mice were minced and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a
buffered solution containing papain (0.67 mg/ml). The cell
suspension was titrated using 40 μg/ml DNase in MEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% horse serum, then
seeded in poly-L-lysine-coated 6-well plates at a density of
8×105 cells per well for the comet assay, Western blot analysis,
and RT-PCR protocol, at a density of 4×105 per well in 24-well
plates for immunocytochemical staining, and at a density of
1×105 per well in 96-well plates for MTT assay.
The identity of cultured cells
Cells cultured in complete medium for six days were plated
out on collagen-coated coverslips and incubated at 37 °C with
5% CO2 until they were approximately 20% confluent.
Immunocytochemical staining for β-tubulin was done to
determine the identity of the cultured cells.
Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning
The plated primary cultured spinal cord neurons were put
into a small, temperature-controlled (37 °C), hyperbaric
chamber (DWC450-1150, Qilingyi Institute, Shanghai, China)
according to the method described by Messier and Fisher
(1990). In order to maintain a physiological pH, the chamber's
gas composition was 98% O2 and 2% CO2. At a compression
rate of 0.02 MPa/min, a pressure of 0.35 MPa was achieved
within 20 min and maintained for 2 h. Then, the chamber was
gradually decompressed to atmospheric pressure at the same
rate.
H2O2-induced oxidative injury
At various time points after HBO exposure (0 h, 3 h, 7 h,
11 h, and 23 h), H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) diluted in distilled
water was added into the culture medium at a final
concentration of 50 μM and maintained for 1 h at 37 °C.
Then, the cells were assayed for MTT or harvested to detect
DNA damage with the comet assay. To examine the changes in
enzyme expression using Western blot or RT-PCR, the cells
were harvested at various time points after HBO exposure (1 h,
4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h) without subsequent H2O2 stimulation.
The H2O2-mediated oxidative injury was produced in the
80 (2007) 1087–1093present study to simulate the damage induced by ischemia–
reperfusion. The protocol chosen in this study is due to the
findings that ROS is one of main compositions and plays an
important role in ischemia–reperfusion injury (Cuzzocrea et al.,
2001; Li and Jackson, 2002).
MTT assay to determine cell viability
Briefly, the culture medium was changed to a medium con-
taining 0.5 g/l MTT and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then the
supernatant was discarded, and the cells were mixed thoroughly
with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 100 μl/well). When the crystals
were dissolved, the optical density absorbance values of 10wells in
each group were measured with an Elx800 plate reader at 570 nm.
Cell viability is directly proportional to the absorbance value.
Comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) to determine
neuronal DNA damage
Comet assay was done as described by Speit and Bonzheim
(2003). Briefly, a 10 μl cell suspension (5×105 in number) was
mixed with 100 μl low melting agarose (LMA; 0.5% in PBS),
added to microscope slides that had been covered with a bottom
the median tail moment (tail length×percentage of DNA in the
tail) per cellular nucleus, measurements were made under a
fluorescencemicroscope (Nikon, TE2000, Tokyo, Japan) using an
image analysis system (Comet Assay II, V1.02, Haverhill, UK).
Western blot analysis of antioxidant enzyme expression
Protein extracts from the primary cultured spinal cord
neurons of each group were obtained with a RIPA-buffer. The
protein content of the samples was determined as previously
described (Selesniemi et al., 2005). An equal amount of protein
(20 μg/lane) determined by the BCA method was loaded.
Western blot analysis was performed with rabbit anti-mice HO-
1 antibody or rabbit anti-mice superoxide dismutase (SOD)
antibody (1:500, respectively; StressGen, Victoria, BC,
Canada). Following 2 h incubation at 37 °C, the membrane
was washed extensively with PBST and incubated for 1 h at
37 °C in a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich
Co.). The band intensities of HO-1 protein on the PVDF-
membrane were analyzed with an image analysis system and are
shown as relative intensity values compared to β-actin.
RT-PCR analysis of antioxidant enzyme expression
RT-PCR was used to detect the level of HO-1 mRNA in the

in primary culture (Fig. 1A). The cell processes were long, thin,
and homogeneously arranged. Over 90% of the cells were
stained immunocytochemically for β-tubulin, a marker of
neurons, which confirmed their neuronal identity (Fig. 1B).
This degree of purity met the demand for subsequent
experiments using the primary neurons.
Cell viability
The MTT assay was used to determine the effect of HBO
preconditioning on cell viability in H2O2-insulted spinal neurons.
The results showed that the treatment caused a dramatic decrease
in cell viability, whereas after a single preconditioning HBO
exposure, cell viability was significantly improved. The protec-
tive effect ofHBOpreconditioning on cell viability began 4 h after
the treatment, reached its peak at 12 h, and lasted at least 24 h,
which was as long as we observed (Fig. 2).
DNA damage

neurons subjected to a H2O2 insult but not to HBO
preconditioning were much more frequent. On the other hand,
at various time points after HBO exposure, the same degree of
H2O2 treatment induced less DNA damage in the neurons
(shown as a reduction in the tail moment values). The protective
effect of HBO preconditioning started 4 h after a single HBO
exposure and lasted at least 24 h.
HBO preconditioning upregulates HO-1
The expression of antioxidant enzyme protein
Western blot results showed that the amount of antioxidant
enzyme HO-1 in spinal cord neurons was enhanced 4 h after
HBO exposure, achieved a peak at 8 h, and lasted at least 24 h,
which was as long as we observed. However, there was no clear
difference in the expression of SOD between the groups with
and without HBO treatment (Fig. 4).
HO-1 mRNA transcription
A representative photograph of RT-PCR is presented in
Fig. 5A, and a histogram of the correlated results from the
densitometric analysis of three separate experiments is shown in
Fig. 5B. The HO-1 mRNA level in each group is shown as a
ratio to that of β-actin. The results demonstrate that the
transcription of HO-1 mRNA was barely seen in the group
without HBO treatment. In contrast, after HBO preconditioning,
the expression of HO-1 mRNA in spinal cord neurons was
increased 1 h after HBO exposure, and peaked at 8 h after HBO
treatment (about a three-fold increase). Then, the HO-1 mRNA
levels gradually declined and reached the level observed in the
control group.
SnMP blocks HBO-induced tolerance
Pretreatment of the spinal cord neurons with 10 μM SnMP
before HBO treatment abolished the protective effect of HBO
preconditioning against a H2O2-induced decrease in cell

Discussion
The present study demonstrates that a single HBO
pretreatment given to primary cultured spinal cord neurons
improved cellular viability and reduced DNA damage caused by
the H2O2 challenge. After HBO treatment, an increase in HO-1
expression at both the protein and mRNA levels was identified
in the cultured neurons. Treatment with SnMP, a specific HO-1
inhibitor, prior to HBO pretreatment abolished the HBO-
induced adaptive protection that had been noted in cultured
spinal neurons. These results indicate that HBO preconditioning
can directly act on neurons, enhance endogenous antioxidant
enzyme activities, and thereby induce the tolerance against
secondary oxidative stress in cultured spinal neurons.
Our previous in vivo studies found that an initial oxidative
stress during HBO pretreatment plays an important role in the

(Dong et al., 2002; Nie et al., 2006). However, it is unknown
whether the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activities plays a
role in HBO preconditioning induced tolerance in neurons. In the
present study, we measured the levels of HO-1 and superoxide
dismutase (SOD), and found that the HO-1 levels in the primary
cultured neurons were significantly enhanced after a single
exposure to HBO. HO-1 expression, detected with Western blot
and RT-PCR, was increased 4 h after HBO treatment, peaked at
8 h, and lasted for at least 24 h, the observation period of this
study. This induction pattern paralleled the development of the
HBO preconditioning effect on cellular viability and neuronal
DNA. There were no significant changes in SOD level after HBO
preconditioning in the present study, which is consistent with the
result from studies on lymphocytes (Speit et al., 2000; Rothfuss
et al., 2001). However, increased SOD expression in spinal cord
after repeated HBO preconditioning was found in our previous in
vivo study (Nie et al., 2006). The possible explanation for the
divergent findings might be that the number of HBO exposures
was different in the experiments.
Several studies have shown that upregulation of HO-1
confers increased resistance against oxidative threat (Applegate
et al., 1991; Ferris et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2005; Ryter and Choi,
2005). In addition, experiments with HO-1 knock-out mice
found a reduction in stress defense of oxidative damage (Chen-
Roetling et al., 2005). The present study found that treatment
with 10 μM SnMP before HBO pretreatment abolished the
HBO-induced adaptive protection in cultured spinal neurons,
therefore demonstrating that HO-1 plays a key role in HBO
preconditioning against oxidative injury.
The mechanism(s) by which HO-1 exhibits its role in anti-
oxidant protection is not yet clear. HO-1 is one of two isoforms of
heme oxygenase that catabolize cellular heme to biliverdin,
carbon monoxide, and free iron. It is well known that bilirubin, a
metabolite of heme degradation, is itself a potent antioxidant
(Stocker et al., 1987). The induction of ferritin synthesis, as a
result of iron removal from the degradation of heme by HO-1,
may also be involved (Meneghini, 1997). Intracellular free iron
can react with H2O2 and give rise to the toxic hydroxyl radical via
the Fenton reaction. Due to the release of free iron during the
catalysis of heme byHO-1, ferritin may be released to restrict iron
from participating in the Fenton reaction. Thus, accumulation of
ferritin is related to iron sequestration and may provide protection
against oxidative damage (Meneghini, 1997).
In conclusion, the present study shows that a single episode
of HBO preconditioning upregulates HO-1 expression and
induces protection against oxidative injury in primary cultured
spinal cord neurons. SnMP, a specific HO-1 inhibitor, abolished
HBO-induced preconditioning effects, indicating that HO-1
plays an essential role in HBO-induced protection against
oxidative injury in the spinal neurons.
