Transplantation of neurospheres derived from bone marrow stromal cells 
promotes neurological recovery in rats with spinal cord injury
Abstract Previous studies have revealed that cell therapy 
using bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) could promote 
motor functional recovery in animals with spinal cord injury 
(SCI). We describe here the development of cell biology 
technique and the experimental study of regeneration in 
SCI. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential 
for neurological recovery by transplantation neurospheres 
(NS) derived from BMSCs into thoracic SCI. Adult Fisher 
rats were used: 45 were subjected to complete thoracic SCI 
performed by the balloon compression method. BMSCs 
were cultured in vitro to obtain NS. Seven days after tho-
racic SCI, groups of 15 rats each received transplants of 
BMSCs-NS (group A), BMSCs (group B), or injection of 
medium only (group C) into the SCI lesion. Rats from each 
group were evaluated and compared longitudinally for 
motor function recovery. The spinal cords (SC) of injured 
rats were harvested at day 21 or day 42 and prepared for 
histological analysis. Five weeks after transplantation, many 
neuronal or axonal sproutings were observed and replaced 
by host cells in the SCI lesion of group A. Also, transplanted 
BMSCs-NS expressed neuronal lineage markers. Trans-
planted rats could walk with weight bearing and showed 
recovered motor evoked potentials (MEPs).

Introduction
Severe spinal cord injury (SCI) usually results in long-last-
ing defi cits involving partial or complete paralysis and loss 
of sensation below the level of the injury. Cell transplanta-
tion to repair SCI is an active area of research with the goal 
of recovering the functional defi cit.1 The central nervous 
system (CNS) has long been regarded as incapable of regen-
eration, and hence the recent discovery of stem cell popula-
tions in the CNS has generated intense interest.1,2 Neural 
stem cells (NSCs) are capable of undergoing expansion and 
differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendro-
cytes in vitro and in vivo. However, NSC sources are deep 
inside the brain, and this inaccessibility severely limits their 
clinical utility. Identifi cation of alternate sources of neural 
cells is therefore highly desirable. Multipotent stem cells, 
which have been detected in multiple tissues in adult 
mammals, participate in normal replacement and repair3–5 
while undergoing self-renewal. BMSCs contain a small frac-
tion of stem cells that can differentiate into neurons or glial 
cells.1,3–12 Transplantation of such stem cells has the potential 
to promote functional recovery after SCI.10,12–15 BMSCs 
have potential clinical use as autografts whereas embryonic 
stem (ES) cells or stem cells from fetuses can be used as 
allografts.15 Previous reports have shown that transplanta-
tion of only BMSCs after SCI was insuffi cient for high-order 
functional recovery because few BMSCs differentiate into 
neuronal cells.9,12,13 We have previously reported an original 
cell line that collects neural stem cell-like masses from 
BMSCs.16 This new cell biology technique has the potential 
to resolve problems with recent treatment for SCI using 
NSCs or BMSCs. The transplantation of BMSC-neuro-
spheres (BMSCs-NS) in rats with SCI was investigated here, 
and a good level of neurological recovery was demon-
strated. The present cell biology technique provides a new 
approach for SCI therapy involving autograft cell transplan-
tation of neural stem cells.16

Materials and methods
BMSCs culture
BMSCs obtained from thigh bones of green fl uorescent 
protein (GFP) rats17 (mean age, 8 weeks; hemizygous GFP 
transgenic Wistar rats provided by Health Science Research 
Resources Bank, Japan) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modi-
fi ed Eagle’s medium (DMEM); Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, 
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.16 The 
green fl uorescent protein (GFP) is a protein composed of 
238 amino acid residues (26.9kDa) that exhibits bright 
green fl uorescence when exposed to blue light. In cell and 
molecular biology, the GFP gene is frequently used as a 
reporter of expression. Almost all tissues of the GFP trans-
genic rat, including BMSCs, are green under excitation light. 
The cells were incubated in dishes at 37ºC in 5% CO2 for 5 
days, and nonadherent cells were removed by replacing the 
medium. After reaching confl uence at approximately 2–3 
weeks, the cells were harvested with 0.05% w/v trypsin and 
0.02% w/v ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) for 5 min at 37ºC, 
replated, cultured again for 1 week, and fi nally harvested. 
Cells used in this study were harvested after three to fi ve 
passages.
BMSCs-NS induction
Subconfl uent cultures of BMSCs were changed to differen-
tiation media that was a modifi cation of that used by Suzuki 
et al.16 Twenty-four hours before neuronal induction, the 
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin was replaced with prein-
duction media consisting of DMEM/10% FBS/1 mM 
β-mercaptoethanol. To initiate neuronal differentiation, the 
preinduction media was removed and cells transferred to 
neuronal induction media composed of DMEM/1% FBS 
and containing 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 200 μM 
butylated hydroxyanisole. After 12–72 h, many adherent 
cells detached from the dishes. Some of these fl oating cells 
changed into neural-like cells and were positive for nestin, 
a marker of neural progenitors. After counting and testing 
their viability, cells were cultured in medium containing 
Neurobasal A (Gibco-BRL), 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 U/
ml streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine, supplemented with 
B-27 (Gibco-BRL) and basic fi broblast growth factor 
(bFGF; 40 ng/ml; Kaken Pharmaceutical). This medium was 
a modifi cation of that used by Svendsen et al.18 Cells were 
maintained in this medium, and the bFGF was replaced 
each day. Spheroids (clusters of fl oating cells) became 
apparent after 7–15 days.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) model and transplantation
The balloon compression model using a 2 Fr. Fogarty cath-
eter (M&I Medical Sales, Miami, FL, USA) was used for 
complete SCI in rats.19,20 Studies were performed in 48 adult 
female Fisher rats weighing approximately 170 g (8 weeks 
of age) at the beginning of the experiment. Under anesthe-
sia with intramuscular ketamine (64 mg/kg) and xylazine 
(4.5 mg/kg), partial laminectomy of the T9 vertebra was 
performed on 45 rats. A 2 Fr. Fogarty catheter was placed 
into the epidural space and the balloon tip inserted at the 
T10 level. The balloon was infl ated with 70 μl saline for 3 
seconds under the T9–T10 lamina. All rats showed complete 
paraplegia (BBB score of 0) after balloon compression.20,21 
Partial laminectomy was performed in 3 rats as a sham 
operation group. Transplantation was performed 7 days 
after SCI using a Hamilton syringe. Each rat was trans-
planted with 50 μl gel or medium containing cells into the 
injured spinal cord.10 A total of 10 rats received 2 × 107 
BMSCs-NS within 0.1% collagen gel for preparation before 
transplantation (group A). Another 10 rats received nonin-
duced 2 × 107 BMSCs in 0.1% collagen gel (group B). 
Finally, 10 rats were injected with medium only (group C). 
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with 
the Guidelines for Animal Experiments at Yamaguchi 
University.
Behavioral and electrophysiological evaluations
Animals were carefully maintained in an air-conditioned 
room at 22ºC with appropriate humidity and had free access 
to food and water. Behavioral evaluation was performed 
using the open-fi eld BBB scoring system.21 Scores from 0 
(complete paralysis) to 21 (normal gait) were recorded 
every day for 6 weeks after SCI. Scoring was performed by 
an investigator blinded to the treatment status. Signifi cant 
differences between BBB scores were examined using the 
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 
Bonferroni post hoc analysis for multiple group compari-
sons to determine the statistical signifi cance of the results. 
All values are given as mean ± SEM. Values of P < 0.01 were 
considered as statistically signifi cant.
Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) following transcranial 
electric train stimulation were recorded from bilateral gas-
trocnemius muscles in rats anesthetized with ketamine.22,23 
Groups A–C and naïve rats were examined longitudinally 
every week before and after SCI. For electrical stimulation, 
bipolar needle electrodes were fi xed onto the skull surface. 
The anodal (+) electrode was inserted percutaneously into 
the scalp and the cathodal (–) electrode was placed in the 
mouth.23 The train was two times; the intensity of the stimu-
lus was about 15 mA of 0.2-ms duration. The interstimulus 
interval (ISI) was at 2 ms. After the last MEP recording, all 
rats were checked for disappearance of the MEP wave fol-
lowing transection of the sciatic nerve.
Histological evaluations
Injured rat SCs were harvested at day 21 and day 42 after 
SCI. Animals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal 
injection of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg) and transcar-
dially perfused with saline for 5 min followed by 4% para-
133
formaldehyde (PFA) in 0.01 M PBS. SCs were removed 
and postfi xed in the same fi xative overnight at 4ºC for 
frozen sectioning. They were then rapidly frozen using 
liquid nitrogen, and tissue sections 6 μm thick were cut 
longitudinally for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining or 
immunohistochemical study. The source and dilution of 
primary antibodies used were as follows: mouse IgG anti-
β-tubulin III (Tuj1), monoclonal (1 : 500; ChemiconR, Tem-
ecula, CA, USA), rabbit IgG anti-glial fi brillary protein 
(anti-GFAP), polyclonal (1 : 500; ChemiconR), mouse IgG 
anti-ED1, monoclonal (1 : 200; ChemiconR), rabbit IgG 
anti-GAP43, polyclonal (1 : 800; ChemiconR), and anti-GFP 
Alexa 488-conjugated (1 : 200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, 
OR, USA). For fl uorescence staining, secondary antibodies 
were Texas red or fl uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conju-
gated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1 : 100; DAKO, 
Denmark).16 Staining without secondary antibodies was 
investigated in each experiment. Images were obtained with 
the confocal laser-scanning microscope (GB-200; Olympus, 
Tokyo, Japan).16 For measurement of cavity volume, fi ve rats 
in each group at 6 weeks after SCI were used. Sagittal cryo-
stat sections were stained with H&E and examined with a 
light microscope.24,25 The area of cavity within the SC was 
measured with the image processing and analysis program 
NIH Image R 1.61 on the section of the largest cavity for-
mation in each SC. Values of P < 0.05 were considered 
statistically signifi cant by Bonferroni post hoc analysis for 
multiple group comparisons.
Results
Neurological recovery
After induction, neurosphere formation from BMSCs was 
observed similar to a previous report from our laboratory.16 
Group A rats (transplantation of BMSCs-NS) were treated 
with these neurospheres. The BBB locomotor scores were 
assessed at 3, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days after SCI in all 
ten rats from the three groups and in the sham operation 
group. All rats had a score of 21 before SCI. Rats that had 
the sham laminectomy operation had a constant score of 21. 
Three days after SCI, all rats had a score of 0. The BBB 
score for group C showed almost no recovery and remained 
less than 3 for 42 days (Fig. 1). The scores for groups A and 
B showed gradual recovery 1 week after transplantation 
and remarkable recovery 2 weeks after transplantation (Fig. 
1). The rate of improvement for group A was signifi cantly 
greater than the rate for group B (P < 0.005) and C (P < 
0.0001; two-way repeated measures of ANOVA). For abso-
lute score attained, group A showed signifi cant improve-
ment compared with group B (P < 0.001) and C (P < 0.0001) 
for all time points from 21 days after SCI (ANOVA, Bonfer-
roni post hoc analysis) (see Fig. 1).
The average mean of the fi nal recovery scores in group 
A was 7.8 ± 1.42, indicating weight support with hindlimbs. 
In group B it was 5.7 ± 0.90, indicating active movement of 
three joints of the hindlimbs. The recovery score in group C 
was 1.4 ± 0.29, indicating slight movement of one or two 
joints of the lower limbs (see Fig. 1).21 The highest scores in 
group A were 14, 13, and 12, indicating occasional coordina-
tion for weight support enabling steps with forelimbs and 
hindlimbs. The lowest scores for two rats in group A indi-
cated lack of neurological recovery. Rats with good neuro-
logical recovery in group B could occasionally step with 
weight support; however, six rats could only step forward 
without weight support. MEPs were recorded at 3, 14, 21, 
28, and 42 days after SCI in each of the ten rats of all three 
groups and in two naïve rats. MEP signals could be recorded 
in the two naïve rats at all times. After SCI, the MEPs for 
all the rats in groups A–C disappeared (Fig. 2), and the 
animals could no longer walk. MEPs could not be detected 
in all group C rats at any time. MEPs were detected 5 weeks 
after transplantation in a few group B rats, but the latency 
was more than doubled (20 ms), and amplitude was signifi -
cantly decreased (Fig. 2). Two weeks after transplantation, 
no clear MEPs were recorded in group A rats. However 5 
weeks after transplantation, MEPs similar to those of 
normal rats were recorded in two animals from group A 
(Fig. 2; cases 1 and 2). A MEP wave pattern with decreased 
amplitude was recorded in two rats (Fig. 2; case 3). These 
electrophysiological results correlated well with the behav-
ioral results from each rats.
Histology analysis
Five rats in each group were killed for H&E staining 42 days 
after SCI. H&E staining of parasagittal SC sections (50, 100, 
and 150 μm lateral from center) was followed by analysis 
by light microscopy in the SCI region of groups A–C in 
cavity size. Cavity size was 8.13 ± 0.927 mm2 in group A, 
11.36 ± 2.958 mm2 in group B, and 19.35 ± 3.2 mm2 in group 
C. Animals showed signifi cant differences in cavity size 
between group A and group C (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5). The cavity 
size in group B tended to be smaller than that in group C 
(P = 0.155).

cord injury
Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to Tuj1 (a neuron 
marker), GFAP (an astrocyte marker), and GFP (a donor 
cell) produced the following observations. Fourteen days 
after transplantation in group A, double-positive cells with 
GFP (green, donor cells) and each antibody stain (red, indi-
cating neurons and astrocytes) were observed in the SCI 
region, and these cells migrated into the normal SC (Fig. 
4A,B). In group B, GFP-positive cells were observed in the 
SC, but double-positive cells with neuronal markers were 
not observed (Fig. 3). Numerous GFP-positive donor cells 
were observed in SCs of group A but not group B 14 days 
after transplantation. However, 42 days after SCI, very few 
GFP-positive cells were observed in the SCs of group A. 
Two weeks after transplantation, the survival rate of 
transplanted cells was 0.0066% ± 0.0027% in group A 
and 0.0012% ± 0.0003% in group B. Five weeks after 
135
transplantation, BMSCs were no longer identifi ed in group 
B; however, a small number of BMSCs-NS cells (230 ± 128) 
survived in group A. Surviving cells expressed Tuj1 (neuron 
marker: 10.2% ± 5.4%) and GFAP (astrocyte marker: 
54.3% ± 16.1%). Increased host GFAP-, Tuj1-, and ED1-
positive cells were observed around the smaller cavity 
region of groups A and B relative to group C (Fig. 6). ED1-

(red-labeled cells and processes, indicating neuron and axon). Green 
fl uorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells (green-labeled cells) were 
transplanted BMSCs. BMSCs were identifi ed as green fl uorescent cell 
assemblies of various sizes in the spinal cord 2 weeks after transplanta-
tion. Cavity volumes in group B appeared smaller than SC in group C 
because the host Tuj1-positive cells were preserved around the surviv-
ing BMSCs

was labeled with a red marker in the upper middle panel. GFAP was 
also labeled with a red marker in the lower middle panel. Transplanted 
BMSCs-NS expressed GFP and Tuj1 or GFAP. Tuj1- and GFP-positive 
cells indicated that transplanted BMSCs-NS cells survived and func-
tioned as neurons in the spinal cord. GFAP- and GFP-positive cells

3.2 mm2 (group C). Analysis of cavity size showed signifi cant differ-
ences between group A and C (P < 0.05). Bars ± SEM

positive cells (indicating macrophages or microglia) and 
fi broblast cells were more numerous in the cavity region of 
group A than in group B (Fig. 6A). Host Tuj1-positive cells 
and processes (indicating neurons and axons) were observed 
among these cells. In addition, GAP43-positive cells, indi-
cating regenerated new axons or preserved host axons, were 
observed among ED1-positive cells and fi brous tissues (Fig. 
6B). Tuj1-positive fi bers (indicating neurons and axons) 
were observed around the reduced cavity (Fig. 6C). GAP43-
positive fi bers were increased around the injured area and 
crossed the obstacle area (Fig. 6D).
Discussion
We demonstrated in the present study that transplantation 
of both the BMSCs and BMSCs-NS into SCs after compres-
sion injury promoted the neurological recovery of hindlimb 
motor function. Electrophysiological evaluation suggested 
clear regeneration of the long tract by cell transplantation 
in some animals. It would be preferable to transplant cells 
during acute-phase SCI; however, here the BMSCs and 
BMSCs-NS were transplanted 7 days after SCI because at 
least 1 week is needed to cultivate these cells for clinical 
use. Transplanted BMSCs and BMSCs-NS survived in the 
lesion of host SCs for 2 weeks after transplantation. Trans-
planted BMSCs-NS expressed some neuronal lineage

were mainly observed (triangle). 
B In the region (shown by boxed 
* in A) of these increased 
cellular scaffolds, GAP43 
(red-labeled fi bers, indicating 
regenerated new axons; arrows) 
were mainly observed among 
ED1-positive cells and 
fi broblasts. C Besides the region 
(*) of the cavity, host Tuj1-
positive cells and processes 
(indicating neurons and axons) 
were observed among some 
surviving BMSCs-NS cells 
(green-labeled cells). D Border 
area of injured and normal 
spinal cord; GAP43-positive 
fi bers were increased and 
crossed the obstacle area
markers, whereas BMSCs maintained their original pheno-
type. Few cells survived for 5 weeks after transplantation; 
however, the SCI regions were repopulated with host neu-
ronal or infl ammatory cells. In the BMSCs-NS group in 
particular, the transplanted cells mobilized not only neuro-
nal cells but also the fi rst processes of regeneration with 
infl ammatory cells (macrophages or microglia) in the 
damaged region. We believe these reactions may be the fi rst 
step in regeneration of the host SC, because in other tissues 
it has been shown that degenerated myelin or neurons must 
fi rst be eliminated before regeneration can occur.26,27
The precise mechanism by which transplantation of 
NSCs or BMSCs promotes functional recovery after SCI is 
still unclear. It has been suggested that BMSCs-NS trans-
plantation promotes regenerative potential within the host 
SCI. Transplanted BMSCs expressed no neuronal markers 
in the spinal cord. However, BMSC transplantation had an 
effect on the injured spinal cord. We think that the trans-
planted BMSCs survived for only a short time in the spinal 
cord and mainly function as a cellular scaffold in the acute 
phase. In addition, the present results suggest that BMSCs-
NS survive in host SCs from the acute to subacute phase as 
neuronal phenotypes and play roles as temporal compo-
nents of neural tissues until regeneration of the host SCs 
has begun. We think that these differences may be the 
reason for changes of functional recovery rate in groups A 
and B. The CNS has long been regarded as incapable of 
regeneration, but the recent discoveries of SCI research 
137
have revealed that the CNS environment is globally permis-
sive of regeneration.28–31 Also, failure of regeneration may 
be the result of locally unfavorable conditions in the lesion 
site, based on fi ndings that marked regeneration similar to 
normal projections can occur spontaneously.28 This phe-
nomenon is observed in the clear-cut SCI model, but it was 
suggested that regeneration occurred in SCs of some 
BMSCs-NS transplanted rats.28
Untreated SCIs have the potential to regenerate; 
however, cavity formation, neuronal necrosis, and increased 
apoptosis were fi nally observed.16,32 Therefore, we believe it 
is important in the acute to subacute phase that neuronal 
replacement to promote and assist SC regeneration occurs 
to start the regeneration brought about by host cells. Subtle 
differences in the SC microenvironment provided by cel-
lular scaffolding in these phases may have allowed good 
functional recovery to occur.31,33 Because of the relatively 
short survival of transplanted cells, the BMSCs-NS were 
unlikely to have disturbed the initial process of SC 
regeneration.
Transplantation of NSCs for SCI was recently reported 
to induce recovery, but this procedure might present prob-
lems when applied for clinical use.34–36 If many NSCs survive 
in SCs for a long time, transplanted cells will interfere with 
regeneration of host SCs because we cannot control abnor-
mal proliferation of NSCs in the present technology.12,15,36
It has been proposed that BMSC transplantation for SCI 
promotes neurological recovery or decreases neuronal 
apoptosis.7,10,13,34–39 However, the mechanism of action for 
SCI is still unclear. Previous studies suggest the main reasons 
for neuronal recovery were secretion of soluble growth 
factors or cell fusions.37–39 BMSC transplantation in the 
present study caused rats with SCI to undergo good neuro-
logical recovery. It was well known that BMSCs secrete 
neurotrophic factors,38 and it has been reported that nestin-
positive BMSCs favor the astroglial lineage in neural pro-
genitors and stem cells by releasing active bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4.39
Depending on the approach used to treat SCI, BMSCs-
NS may be very useful in this procedure because BMSCs-
NS have the advantages of both NSCs and BMSCs while 
excluding their separate disadvantages.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the effi cacy and safety of BMSCs-NS implan-
tation were demonstrated in a rat model of SCI. It was 
shown that engrafted cells acquired neural and glial pheno-
types. This differentiation led to new axonal sprouting asso-
ciated with improvements in SC function. Cellular treatment 
with BMSCs-NS is clinically relevant in patients with SCI. 
BMSCs-NS can be readily harvested from adult bone 
marrow, expanded in vitro, and readministered to the 
patient, thus avoiding immunosuppressive therapy. For 
these reasons, SCI treatment using BMSCs-NS might 
provide an alternative to NSCs derived from fetuses or 
embryonic stem cells.
