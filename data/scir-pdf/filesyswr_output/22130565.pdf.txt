Abstract
Therapeutic strategies following spinal cord injury must address the multiple barriers that limit
regeneration. Multiple channel bridges have been developed that stabilize the injury following
implantation and provide physical guidance for regenerating axons. These bridges have now been
employed as a vehicle for localized delivery of lentivirus. Implantation of lentivirus loaded
multiple channel bridges produced transgene expression that persisted for at least 4 weeks.
Expression was maximal at the implant at the earliest time point, and decreased with increasing
time of implantation, as well as rostral and caudal to the bridge. Immunohistochemical staining
indicated transduction of macrophages, Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and astrocytes within the
bridge and adjacent tissue. Subsequently, the delivery of lentivirus encoding the neurotrophic
factors NT3 or BDNF significantly increased the extent of axonal growth into the bridge relative
to empty scaffolds. In addition to promoting axon growth, the induced expression of neurotrophic
factors led to myelination of axons within the channels of the bridge, where the number of
myelinated axons was significantly enhanced relative to control. Combining gene delivery with
biomaterials to provide physical guidance and create a permissive environment can provide a
platform to enhance axonal growth and promote regeneration.

INTRODUCTION
Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in paralysis below the level of the injury. The limited
regeneration observed in the spinal cord (SC) has been attributed to insufficient trophic
factor support, and up-regulation of axonal growth inhibitors. SCI induces a number of
processes, including neuron and oligodendrocyte cell death, demyelination, inflammation,
and deposition of a glial scar. Promoting regeneration requires a combinatorial approach that
can address this multitude of processes, which is exemplified by the early experiments with
implantation of autologous peripheral nerve (PN) grafts [1]. Axonal elongation by the PN
graft is promoted and directed by the graft architecture and cells (e.g., Schwann cells) that
secrete trophic factors. PN grafts have limited clinical potential, as their source is limiting,
which has motivated the development of systems and strategies to recapitulate their effects
[2].
Recapitulating the effects of PN grafts is challenging, as the precise contribution of the
architecture and cell-secreted factors (e.g., extracellular matrix, trophic factors) is ill
defined. The structural aspects of PN grafts have been targeted with biomaterial bridges,
which provide mechanical stability to the injured tissue and have channels that span the
bridge to direct axonal elongation [3–5]. The bridges support cell infiltration, which helps
prevent cavity formation that can occur secondary to the initial injury, and may also limit
scar formation. The channels also support cell infiltration. Cells within the channels are
aligned with the major axis of the bridge, which can provide a directional signal for
regenerating axons.
Providing trophic factors that would normally be produced by Schwann cells within PN
grafts has been explored through a range of cell and drug therapies. Direct injection and
osmotic pumps have been employed to deliver trophic factors to promote neurite outgrowth
[6–8]. Alternatively, transplantation of Schwann cells [9–12], stem cells [12–15], or cells
genetically engineered to secrete inductive factors [16–18] are all strategies that have been
reported to enhance axonal growth through the injury, however, the impact of these
strategies is hampered by limited cell survival and engraftment (~15%) [19]. Gene delivery
represents a versatile approach in which transduced cells can function as bioreactors for the
localized production of neurotrophic factors; however, improved delivery strategies are
required to localize delivery to the injury.
In this report, we investigate delivery of lentiviral vectors from multiple channel bridges as a
combinatorial approach to promote regeneration in the injured SC. The bridge provides the
structural support to stabilize the injury and architecture to direct axonal elongation; whereas
lentivirus induced expression of neurotrophic factors can promote axon growth. Lentivirus
was immobilized to nanoparticles and loaded into bridges for implantation into a rat spinal
cord lateral hemisection. The transgene expression profile was characterized, as were the
location and identity of transduced cells. Subsequently, lentiviral vectors encoding NT3 and
BDNF were delivered to promote the growth of axons into and down the channels of the
bridge. Axon growth and myelination were characterized as a function of time, treatment,
and location within the bridge. The combination of soluble vectors and physical structure
synergize to promote axon growth, and the vector releasing bridges provide a platform to
investigate additional factors in SC regeneration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus production
Lentivirus was produced in HEK-293T cells grown in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37°C, and
5% CO2. The lentiviral packaging vectors (pMDL-GagPol, pRSV-Rev, pIVSVSV-G) were

co-transfected along with plenti-CMV-GFP, plenti-CMV-BDNF, plenti-CMV-NT3, or
plenti-CMV-luciferase into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Roche Biosciences, Palo
Alto, CA). After 48 h of transfection, the supernatant was collected and filtered (0.45
micron). Viruses were then concentrated using PEG-it (System Biosciences, Mountain, CA),
with the precipitated lentiviruses suspended with PBS. The virus titer was determined by
HIV-1 p24 Antigen ELISA Kit (ZeptoMetrix Co., Buffalo, NY).
Fabrication of multiple channel bridges
Multiple channel bridges were fabricated using a gas foaming/particulate leaching method as
previously described [4, 5]. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) (75:25 mole ratio of D, L-
lactide to glycolide, 0.76 dL/g, Lakeshore Biomaterials, Birmingham, AL) was dissolved in
dichloromethane (2% w/w) and then emulsified in 1% poly(vinyl alcohol) to create
microspheres. A mixture of PLG microspheres and salt particles (63–106 µm) was loaded
into a custom made aluminum mold with Delrin pin guides using a layer-by-layer technique
and pressurized to 200 psi using a Carver press. The bridges were then equilibrated with
high pressure CO2 gas (800 psi) for 16 h in a custom-made pressure vessel. Afterwards, the
pressure was released over a period of 45 min, which served to fuse adjacent microspheres
creating a continuous polymer structure. The porogen was leached in water for one hour; the
bridges were disinfected in ethanol for 5 minutes and dried overnight. The final bridge
dimensions were 4 mm in length, 2.6 mm in width, and 1.5 mm in height, containing 7
channels 250 µm in diameter (Fig. 1b).
Virus loading into multiple channel bridges
Hydroxylapatite (HA) nanoparticles (Sigma-Aldrich) were suspended in PBS and sonicated
for 1 minute to dissociate aggregates. The HA (1 µL, 10 mg/mL in PBS) was then
complexed with lentivirus (9 µL) encoding luciferase (LV-luc, 3×1011 LP) and incubated for
10 minutes at 4°C. HA/virus complex were then deposited into each channel of the bridge
using Stripper pipet tips (Mid-Atlantic Diagnostics, Mount Laurel, NJ) and placed in dry ice
until implantation.
Rat spinal cord hemisection
A rat spinal cord hemisection model (Fig. 1b) was used to analyze transgene expression and
nerve regeneration. Surgery was performed as previously described [4] on female Long-
Evans rats (180–200 g; Charles River) that were treated according to the Animal Care and
Use Committee guidelines at Northwestern University. Animals were anesthetized using
isoflurane (3% in O2), and a laminectomy was performed at T9-10. A 4-mm long spinal cord
segment, lateral of the midline, was removed to create a hemisection, and bridges were
implanted in the injury space and covered by Gelfoam. (Fig. 1a) The muscles were sutured
together and the skin was stapled. Postoperative care consisted of the administration of
Baytril (enrofloxacin 2.5 mg/kg SC, once a day for 2 weeks), buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg
SC, twice a day for 2 days), and lactate ringer solution (5 mL/100 g, once a day for 5 days).
Bladders were expressed twice a day until bladder function recovered (7–14 days).
Quantification of transgene expression in a hemisection model
Bridges loaded with a lentiviral vector encoding for firefly luciferase were implanted to
quantify transgene expression levels within defined spinal cord segments. One week and
four weeks post implantation, rats (n = 4) were euthanized and fresh spinal segments (T4-
L2) were retrieved. The injury site and five samples rostral and caudal to the injury site were
collected in 5 µm intervals and frozen. The tissues were thawed and 100 µl of lysis buffer
(Cell Culture Lysis Reagent 1X; Promega, Madison, WI) was added, the tissue was
homogenized with microscissors and vortexed. After 10 minutes of incubation at room

temperature the tissue lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C to collect
the supernatant. The luciferase content in the supernatant was quantified using a luciferase
assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and recorded in relative light unit (RLU) per microgram
protein. The total protein amount was measured with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein
assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).
Transgene expression and cell type identification
Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections to analyze the distribution and
identity of transduced cells. Bridges loaded with a lentiviral vector encoding for EGFP were
implanted into the spinal cord. After 7 days, rats (n = 4) were euthanized and the spinal cord
was retrieved, frozen in isopentane (Fisher Scientific), and stored in siliconized Eppendorf
tubes at −80 °C. The tissue section containing the injury site (T8-T11) was cryopreserved in
optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound and sliced longitudinally in 10-µm thick
sections using a cryostat (HM 525, Thermo Scientific). Every other section was collected on
glass slides, post fixed, and stained.
Sections were stained using a double-labeling immunofluorescence staining method. All
collected sections were stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-EGFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
as a primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (green) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) as a secondary antibody. Tissue sections were double stained for specific cell lineages
with primary monoclonal mouse IgG1 antibodies to: (i) anti-S100 (β-subunit) for Schwann
cells (Sigma); (ii) anti-rat prolyl 4-hydroxylase (rPH) for fibroblasts (Acris Antibodies,
Herford, Germany); (iii) anti-rat monocytes/macrophages (ED-1) (Millipore, Billerica, MA);
(iv) anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for reactive astrocytes (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse (red) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used as a
secondary antibody. A Hoechst stain was used to identify the cytoarchitecture. Negative
controls were performed by eliminating the primary antibodies and staining histological
sections of implanted bridges with a lentivirus encoding beta-galactosidase (β-gal).
To determine the identity of transfected cells inside the bridge and the adjacent tissue,
sections were double stained with antibodies for EGFP and specific cell types, and
fluorescence images were captured and overlaid in Photoshop. The percentages of
transduced cells identified as a specific cell type were quantified for four cell types. For each
cell type, 3 rats, 9 tissue sections, and 45 images were analyzed and counted. Images were
taken in three random fields of view of the bridge and two random fields of view of the
adjacent tissue (200X). To count the number of transduced cells, the EGFP and Hoechst
images were superimposed and the positive cells were marked. Subsequently, the location of
EGFP positive cells was overlaid with red fluorescent images and all the marked transduced
cells that overlapped with the red cell stain were counted as positive for each specific cell
type by a blinded observer. Percentages were calculated as the ratio of the transduced cells
identified as a certain cell type to the total counted number of transduced cells.
Immunohistochemistry and quantitative analysis of nerve regeneration and myelination
a. Axon growth—Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections to analyze
axonal growth into the bridges. Bridges were loaded with a lentiviral vector encoding for
either NT3, BDNF, or no lentivirus and implanted into the SC. SCs were retrieved after 1
week (n = 3), 2 weeks (n=6), and 4 weeks (n=6) post implantation, frozen, and sliced
transversally in 10-µm thick sections. Every other section was collected on glass slides. For
analysis, the bridge was divided in three regions based on location; rostral, middle, and
caudal (Fig. 1c). Five sections from each region were stained for neurofilament (NF200;
Sigma-Aldrich) and imaged using a Leica microscope at 50X. Images were stitch together
using photo stitching software (PTgui, New House Internet Services B.V., Rotterdam, The

Netherlands). The total number of axons were counted per channel. Three sections located at
300 µm (rostral), 2000 µm (middle), and 3500 µm (caudal) from the rostral bridge/tissue
boundary were analyzed by a blinded observer. The sections were viewed at 50X to identify
the positions of the 7 channels, and axons were counted within all channels at 400X. Trends
were also confirmed by analyzing the area of neurofilament per channel using ImageJ.
b. Myelination—Sections located within 30 µm from those analyzed for axon growth were
stained for Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) and imaged using a Leica microscope at 400X. The
total number of myelinated axons was estimated by counting the number of MBP positive
rings per channel, n=6 per condition. The extent of myelination was further quantified by
counting the number of channels per bridge that had stained positive for MBP. Only tissue
sections from the rostral segment of the bridge were quantified as the middle and caudal
segments had little to no positive staining for MBP. Results were verified by double staining
adjacent tissue sections for NF200 (green) and MBP (red) and counting the number of
myelinated axons.
Statistics
For multiple comparisons, pairs were compared using an ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test
with a p value <0.05 defined as significant. The numbers of myelinated axons per channel
were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. The error bars represent standard errors in all
figures.
RESULTS
Bridge implantation and transgene expression from lentiviral loaded bridges
Initial studies investigated transgene expression following implantation of lentivirus loaded
bridges in a rat spinal cord lateral hemisection. The bridges supported cell infiltration
resulting in good tissue apposition with all edges of the bridge within a week post surgery
(Fig. s1), with cells located within both the pores and channels of the bridge. Substantial
transgene expression was observed within the injury at 7 days post implantation, and
expression was sustained for at least 4 weeks post surgery (Fig. 2a). Transgene expression
was also observed in segments adjacent to the implantation site, with expression decreasing
with increasing distance from the implant. Expression at the injury site decreased 100 fold
from 1 week to 4 weeks, with the greatest levels occurring at the injury site. At both time
points, the greatest percentage of transgene expression was localized at the injury site, with
48% of total expression at 1 week, and 37% of total expression at 4 weeks. Approximately
90% of the transgene expression occurs within the implant and the 2 adjacent tissue
segments at 1 week, with 80% of expression in the implant and adjacent segments at 4
weeks. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that delivering lentiviral vectors within the
spinal cord results in localized and sustained transgene expression, transgene expression
occurs in a gradient within the spinal cord, and expression is maximal at the implantation
site. No significant increases in inflammation were observed when comparing macrophage
infiltration within the bridges between lentivirus loaded and empty bridges (Fig. s1).
Subsequent experiments investigated the identity of transduced cells within the bridge and
surrounding tissue by using EGFP transgene. At 7 days, transduced cells were localized in
the channels and pores of the bridge and the adjacent tissue (Figs. 2c-e). The identity of
these transduced cells was determined by double staining with antibodies for EGFP and
either S-100β (includes Schwann cells and astrocytes), ED-1 (monocytes and macrophages),
rPH (fibroblasts) or GFAP (reactive astrocytes). Previous studies had identified the first
three cell types as the main ones that infiltrate the bridge after implantation, with these cell
types and reactive astrocytes visualized in the tissue surrounding the bridge [4, 5]. Co-

localization of stains for the cell-specific antigens (red) and transduced cells (green) was
observed for S-100β- (Schwann cells), ED-1-(macrophages) and rPH- (fibroblasts) positive
cells in the bridge and the adjacent tissue (Figs. 3a-c). The percentages of transduced cells in
the bridge identified as Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages were 35%, 31%, and
28%, respectively. No transduced GFAP positive astrocytes were indentified within the
bridge, consistent with previous results that astrocytes did not infiltrate the bridge [4, 5].
EGFP positive astrocytes were observed in the tissue surrounding the bridge (Fig. 3d). In
this tissue, the percentages of transduced cells identified as astrocytes, Schwann cells,
fibroblasts, and macrophages were 35%, 22%, 7.5%, and 12%, respectively. The percentage
of unidentified (i.e. EGFP positive and red label negative) transduced cells in the bridge and
adjacent tissue were 6% and 23.5%, respectively.
Axon growth
Bridges, loaded with lentivirus encoding for NT3 or BDNF, were implanted in a spinal cord
hemisection to investigate the ingrowth of axons into and through the bridge at multiple time
points. Bridges with no lentivirus were used as a negative control (empty). Coronal sections
were grouped by dividing the bridge into 3 regions: rostral, middle and caudal (Fig. 1c). Few
neurofilament positive axons were observed within the channels 1-week post surgery for any
condition, but an increase in the number of axons per channel as a function of time was
observed (Figs. 5b-d). At 2 weeks, substantial numbers of axons were observed within the
channels, with no significant difference in neurofilament staining observed between the 7
channels (Fig. 4). Localization of positive neurofilament staining primarily to the channels
suggests that that the bridge architecture is essential to promoting axonal entry and
regeneration.
The extent of axon growth was a function of neurotrophin expression and time (overall
ANOVA, F=11.8, p<0.0001). At the rostral position, delivery of lentivirus encoding either
NT3 or BDNF significantly increased axon number at 4 weeks compared to the same
condition at 2 weeks (p<0.005) and 1 week (p>0.0001) (Fig. 5b). However, no increase in
the number of axons within the rostral location in the empty bridge was observed between 2
and 4 weeks (p=0.7087). Relative to empty bridges, delivery of lentivirus encoding either
NT3 or BDNF significantly increased (p<0.005) the number of axons per channel in the
rostral section at 4 weeks by approximately a factor of 2 (Fig. 5b); no significant difference
was obtained between NT3 and BDNF (p=0.95) at the rostral position at 4 weeks. For NT3
and BDNF, the axon counts at 4 weeks in the rostral location were significantly greater
compared to empty, NT3, and BDNF at other time points and locations (p<0.005).
The number of axons at the middle and caudal locations of the bridge were less than the
numbers obtained for the rostral section. There were 4.8, 4.3, and 2.3-fold less axons for the
middle segment relative to the rostral segment for NT3, BDNF, or empty loaded bridges,
respectively (Figs. 5b-d). For the caudal location, the number of axons was 3.5, 2.4, and 1.2-
fold less than the rostral location. No significant difference was observed between empty
bridges comparing caudal and rostral locations (p=0.4269) (Figs. 5b,d). At 2 weeks in the
middle section, the number of axons determined for NT3 lentivirus delivery was greater
compared to the BDNF and empty conditions (p=<0.05); however the axon numbers for all
conditions in the middle section reached similar levels at 4 weeks (Fig. 5c). In the caudal
location, at 2 weeks both NT3 expression and empty bridges resulted in greater axon counts
relative to expression of BDNF (p<0.05) (Fig. 5d). At 4 weeks all conditions resulted in
similar axon counts. These results demonstrate that lentiviral delivery of neurotrophic
factors, combined with the permissive environment of the bridge enhances the number of
regenerating axons.

Lentivirus encoding neurotrophins, NT3 or BDNF, enhanced myelination
Myelination of axons within the bridge was subsequently investigated as a function of time
and neurotrophic factor expression. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was observed in several of
the channels in which regenerating axons were present. The middle and caudal regions had
decreased levels of positive MBP staining compared to the rostral region. In the rostral
location, for NT3, 84% of the channels that contained axons stained positive for MBP,
compared to 68% and 32% for BDNF and empty, respectively (Figs. 6a-c). BDNF and NT3
lentiviral delivery significantly enhanced (p<0.01) the number of MBP positive axons and
the number of channels in which MBP was observed, compared to empty bridges (Fig. 6d).
NT3 and BDNF had approximately 18 and 19 myelinated axons per channel, compared to 9
for empty bridges. The increase in the number of myelinated axons per channel correlated
with the increased number of axons per channel. For all conditions, the percentage of
myelinated axons was approximately 13%.
DISCUSSION
We report that delivery of lentivirus encoding the neurotrophins NT3 or BDNF from a
multichannel biomaterial bridge enhanced axon regeneration and axon myelination after
spinal cord injury (SCI) in a rat hemisection model. The delivery of growth factors after an
injury can enhance the regenerative capacity of the body by directing or promoting cell
processes that lead to regeneration. Studies delivering neurotrophic factors after SCI,
including neurotrophin 3 (NT3) [6, 20–24], brain derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) [16,
20, 25–28], nerve growth factor (NGF) [8, 21], glial-cell derived neurotrophin factor
(GDNF) [29, 30], and others [31–33], have shown that these factors enhance axon
regeneration by stimulating axon growth, reducing secondary injury, stimulating cell
survival, and/or promoting axon myelination. These factors are commonly delivered by
osmotic pumps, which can provide a sustained release. Yet, osmotic pumps can clog, require
a second surgery for removal, and deliver the factors near the injury to avoid tissue damage
by the catheter. Alternatively, genetically engineered cells have been transplanted within the
injury site to serve as bioreactors for protein production to locally provide these therapeutic
factors. Nevertheless, a low survival rate for transplanted cells can complicate this strategy
[19]. Gene delivery targeting host cells can induce the expression of neurotrophic factors
from within the injured microenvironment [23]. The direct injection of vectors has been
employed with some benefit [23, 34]; however, expression may not be localized to the
injury. In this report, we have attempted to immobilize lentivirus in a multiple channel
bridge to capture the synergizing effects of both delivering neurotrophic factors and physical
guidance of axonal growth via a bioengineered scaffold.
We have previously reported axonal growth after SCI through a multichannel bridge, which
provides a porous structure that facilitates cellular infiltration to mechanically stabilize the
injury. Multiple channels within the bridge orient infiltrating cells and direct axonal
elongation [4, 5, 35]. The delivery of non-viral vectors from the bridge resulted in localized
transfection [4, 35]. However, the expression level obtained via non-viral vectors may have
been insufficient for functional effects. Herein, we demonstrate that lentivirus delivery
resulted in localized protein expression within the injury site, with lower expression
persisting throughout the adjacent tissue. The expression level with lentivirus delivery was
approximately 1000 fold greater in the bridge than for non-viral vector delivery. The
decreased expression in the adjacent tissue relative to the bridge would be expected to create
a concentration gradient in a secreted factor such as neurotrophins, with the greatest
concentration at the injury and lower concentrations in the adjacent tissue. Axons are known
to respond to changes in the concentration of growth factors, therefore, the gradient
produced by lentivirus delivery may facilitate directed axonal growth toward the injury and
into the bridge.

The cells transduced by lentivirus delivery include macrophages, Schwann cells, and
fibroblasts that had infiltrated the pores of the bridge, consistent with our previous report
using plasmid and lipoplex-loaded bridges [4, 35]. However, lentivirus delivery also resulted
in transduction of astrocytes in the tissue adjacent to the bridge. All of these cells are
commonly present after injury, and can serve diverse functions to enhance or inhibit
regeneration. Macrophages can secrete soluble factors that can alter the regenerative
microenvironment of the bridge, both aiding and inhibiting regeneration [36, 37]. Schwann
cells, which are not endogenous to the spinal cord yet enter through the damaged root entry
zones after injury, may function to support and promote regeneration by releasing growth-
promoting factors and provide remyelination of the axons [38, 39]. Astrocytes, which are
responsible for the formation of the glial scar and are recognized as a barrier to regeneration
by inhibiting the crossing of axons though the tissue, were localized within the adjacent
tissue and the tissue/bridge boundary.
Lentivirus encoding for NT-3 and BDNF were delivered, which target descending tracts
responsible for recovery of motor function. NT3 has been associated with a robust and
consistent outgrowth of corticospinal axons [6, 40]. Administration of exogenous BDNF can
improve survival of axotomized motoneurons in neonatal rats [41]. Lentivirus induced
expression of NT3 and BDNF enhanced axonal growth into the channels of the bridge
relative to empty bridges. This increase observed at the rostral end of the bridge is consistent
with the action of NT3 and BDNF on descending CNS tracts [6, 8, 12]. Future studies will
combine these neurotrophin encoding lentivirus loaded bridges with strategies to degrade the
glial scar that will enhance re-entry into the host tissue, which is necessary to promote
functional recovery from the regenerated axons.
Myelinated axons were observed within the channels of the bridge, and delivery and induced
expression of NT-3 and BDNF significantly increased this number of myelinated axons.
Demyelination of spared axons and lack of myelination of regenerating axons are considered
limiting factors in the recovery of neural function after injury. In chemically induced
demyelination, endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells have been shown to migrate and
remyelinate spared axons [42], though these studies suggest that these cells are able to
migrate a fixed distance. Cell transplantation has been employed as a means to promote
remyelination with some reports indicating that progenitor cells can develop into
oligodendrocytes and remyelinate axons in vivo [43]. Transplantation of PN grafts and
Schwann cells has resulted in myelination of spared and regenerating axons by the Schwann
cells that are delivered alone or as a part of the graft [44–46]. Alternatively, cells have been
transplanted that express NT3 and BDNF, which have enhanced oligodendrocyte survival
and axon myelination [20, 28, 47]. NT3 and BDNF may also enhance a number of other
processes. For example, BDNF has been associated with a reduction in the inflammatory
response, including a reduction in astrocyte numbers [48], which further aids axon
regeneration. Herein, we report an increase in the number of myelinated axons without cell
transplantation. Interestingly, the percentage of myelinated axons was similar between
empty and lentivirus loaded bridges (~13%). This manuscript is the first report of the novel
finding that endogenous cells migrate into the channels to myelinate regenerating axons.
Ongoing studies will further characterize the source and extent of myelination and
investigate strategies to further enhance the process.
CONCLUSIONS
This study investigated lentivirus delivery from multiple channel PLG bridges in a rat spinal
cord hemisection injury model. Transgene expression was greatest at the injury site, with
transduced cells inside the bridge and in the adjacent tissue. Astrocytes, macrophages,

bridge induced axonal growth down the channels. Delivery of lentivirus vectors encoding
for the neurotrophic factors NT3 and BDNF enhanced the number of regenerating axons,
and also the extent of myelination. This study demonstrates that lentivirus delivery of
neurotrophic factors, combined with the permissive environment of the bridge, enhances
nerve regeneration after injury. We report a significant increase in the number of axons and
myelinated axons after SCI. Gene delivery is a versatile strategy in which multiple vectors
can be delivered from one vehicle to promote growth or to block inhibition. Delivering
multiple vectors encoding for distinct proteins is straightforward as each vector will have
similar physical properties, and may provide a mechanism to address the complexity
microenvironment that does not support regeneration.
