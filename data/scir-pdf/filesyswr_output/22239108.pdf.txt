Clostridium botulinum produces the prototype of ADP-
ribosylating C3 transferases (C3bot) that target RhoA, B
and C proteins rendering them inactive (Aktories and Just
2005; Vogelsgesang et al. 2007). C3 transferases therefore
represent a common tool to study Rho-dependent cellular
functions. In neuroscience research, C3bot transferase has
been demonstrated to promote axonal growth in primary
neuronal culture (Jin and Strittmatter 1997), optic nerve lesion
models (Lehmann et al. 1999; Bertrand et al. 2007) and
experimental spinal cord injury (Dergham et al. 2002;
Dubreuil et al. 2003). Over the years, evidence has accumu-
lated that clostridial C3 transferase (C3bot) not only acts as an
enzyme, but in addition is able to promote neurite outgrowth
in a non-enzymatic mode of action (Ahnert-Hilger et al.
2004). Interestingly, application of enzyme-deficient C3bot,
in which the catalytic amino acid glutamate at position 174
was mutated, resulted in growth promoting effects on
hippocampal neurons. In subsequent studies, we successfully
identified a 29-amino acid fragment covering the residues
154–182 (C3bot154)182) still capable of inducing axonal as
well as dendritic growth and branching in neuronal primary
culture and organotypical brain slices (Höltje et al. 2009).

Abstract
C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase is a valuable tool to study Rho-
dependent cellular processes. In the current study we inves-
tigated the impact of enzyme-deficient peptides derived from
Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase in the context of neu-
ronal process elongation and branching, synaptic connectivity,
and putative beneficial effects on functional outcome following
traumatic injury to the CNS. By screening a range of peptidic
fragments, we identified three short peptides from C3bot that
promoted axon and dendrite outgrowth in cultivated hippo-
campal neurons. Furthermore, one of these fragments, a 26-
amino acid peptide covering the residues 156–181 enhanced
synaptic connectivity in primary hippocampal culture. This
peptide was also effective to foster axon outgrowth and re-
innervation in organotypical brain slice culture. To evaluate
the potential of the 26mer to foster repair mechanisms after
CNS injury we applied this peptide to mice subjected to spinal
cord injury by either compression impact or hemisection. A
single local administration at the site of the lesion improved
locomotor recovery. In addition, histological analysis revealed
an increased serotonergic input to lumbar motoneurons in
treated compared with control mice. Pull-down assays
showed that lesion-induced up-regulation of RhoA activity
within the spinal cord was largely blocked by C3bot peptides
despite the lack of enzymatic activity.

 2012 The Authors
Furthermore, beneficial effects on axonal regeneration and
functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice were
observed when this enzyme-deficient peptide was applied at
the site of injury (Boato et al. 2010). To date, the exact
molecular basis, by which enzyme-deficient C3bot peptides
exhibit neurotrophic effects, remains to be elucidated. Also,
important open questions regarding the use of C3bot peptides
to foster neuronal regenerative growth still remain. This is, for
instance, whether a motif such as the surface-exposed ADP-
ribosylation toxin-turn-turn (ARTT) loop that confers sub-
strate specificity and catalytic activity (Ménétrey et al. 2008)
and is included in the 29-amino acid fragment is also essential
for peptide action. Moreover, it is indispensable to gain more
information about the minimal essential length of C3bot-
derived peptides for exhibiting functional growth-promoting
effects within the CNS. To minimise the risk for an unwanted
immune response and to facilitate delivery in the in vivo
situation the effective peptide should be designed as short as
possible. We generated one peptide with a modified sequence,
one C-terminal fragment and four further truncated C3bot
peptides from the original sequence and tested them in a
substantial range of both in vitro and in vivo models. The
effects on neuronal morphology in culture, synaptic connec-
tivity both in culture and the injured spinal cord, and the
influence on axon growth in two different organotypical brain
culture systems were investigated. Two different behavioural
paradigms were applied to study the putative effects on motor
restoration following spinal cord injury in mice. Last but not
least, the impact of C3bot peptides on active RhoA levels
within the injured spinal cord was analyzed.
Materials and methods
Animals
All in vivo experiments were done with Balb/C wild-type mice
(females, 8- to 12-week-old) and were performed in accordance with
German and Flemish guidelines on the use of laboratory animals.
Development of C3bot-derived peptides
C3bot154)182 E/Q (C3bot 29mer E174Q), C3bot154)182 (C3bot
29mer), C3bot156)181 (C3bot 26mer), C3bot160)179 (C3bot 20mer),
C3bot163)177 (C3bot 15mer) and C3bot163)174 (C3bot 12mer) were
synthesized at Pharis Biotec GmbH (Hannover, Germany).
C3bot181)211 (C3bot 31mer) was expressed as recombinant GST-
fusion protein in Escherichia coli TG1 harboring the DNA fragment
in the plasmid pGEX-2T. Peptides were reconstituted in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) pH7.5, sterile filtered (0.22 lm) and used for
the respective experiments.
Antibodies
Immunofluorescence
Monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament protein (200 kDa) and
polyclonal antiserum against microtubule-associated proteins 2,
were from Chemicon International (Hofheim, Germany). Rabbit or
chicken anti-GFP antisera were used to further enhance green
fluorescence (eGFP) (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). Synaptophy-
sin-expressing terminals were visualized by a monoclonal anti-
synaptophysin antibody (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany).
Vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) immunoreactivity was
detected using guinea pig polyclonal serum (Calbiochem, Gibbs-
town, NJ, USA). Serotonin-positive boutons in spinal cord sections
were detected by a polyclonal anti-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)
antiserum obtained from Immunostar (Hudson, WI, USA). Immu-
noreactivity was visualized using goat anti-mouse, goat anti-chicken
Alexa Fluor 488, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, donkey anti-
rabbit as well as donkey anti-guinea pig Cy3- and Cy5-coupled
secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA).
Immunoblotting
The Map2 and synaptophysin antisera were the same as used for
immunofluorescence. A mouse monoclonal IgG from Cytoskeleton
(Denver, CO, USA) was applied to detect RhoA. b-actin was
detected by a polyclonal antiserum purchased from Sigma (St Louis,
MO, USA).
Hippocampal cell culture
Hippocampal neurons were prepared from fetal NMRI mice at
embryonic day 16 (E16). Dissected pieces of hippocampi were
rinsed with PBS, then with dissociation medium [minimal essential
medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IE
insuline/l, 0.5 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin,
44 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES buffer] and dissociated
mechanically. Sedimented cells were resuspended in starter medium
(serum-free neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 0.5 mM
glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 25 lM glutamate)
and plated at a density of 2x104 cells/well (morphometrical analysis)
or 8 x 104 cells/well (analysis of synaptic connectivity) on glass
cover slips pre-coated with poly-L-lysine/collagen. An additional
coating with 10 lg/mL chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (Proteo-
glycan Mix; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was performed in some
experiments. All ingredients were obtained from Gibco/BRL Life
Technologies, Eggenstein, Germany. One day after plating peptide
fragments were added to the culture medium for the indicated time
periods.
Morphometrical analysis
Total length and the overall number of branches from axons and
dendrites were analyzed morphometrically using the Neurolucida
software (MicroBrightField, Williston, ND, USA). The parameter
‘axon length’ represents the integral length of all visible parts of an
axon, including all branches. Experiments were carried out on the
basis of cultures prepared on the same day, from the same animal pool.
Typically, three coverslips were prepared per condition and 8–10
neurons were evaluated on each coverslip. Provided no significant
differences between coverslip means (tested by ANOVA) data were
pooled and given as means ± SEM. Experiments were repeated at
least three times following identical experimental protocols.
Analysis of synaptic connectivity
Detailed analysis was performed using the in-house written software
NeMo 1.4, as described earlier (Henneberger et al. 2005). Briefly,
hippocampal neurons cultured at high density were incubated with

or without C3bot peptides from DIV 4–7. Cultures were transfected
with eGFP to visualize a low number of non-overlapping individual
neurons using the Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). After an expression period of 22 h cultures were fixed
and stained for eGFP (to further enhance green fluorescence) and
synaptophysin or the respective vesicular transmitter transporters.
Labeled neurons were visualized by epifluorescence using a 63
times oil immersion objective. Stained terminals were quantified
within a circular region of interest with a radius of 50 lm centered
on the soma of an eGFP-labeled neuron. Only fluorescence spots
with a diameter of 0.5–2 lm contacting a dendrite and supra-
threshold intensity (average intensity plus three times its SD) were
included in the analysis. In some experiments, synaptic contacts
were counted in individual viewfields (area 350 · 262 lm) at 40
times magnification using untransfected cultures. Neurons were
pooled from different coverslips for statistical analysis provided that
significant differences between the coverslip means (tested by
ANOVA) were absent. Pooled data were then compared using
Student’s t-test.
Organotypical brain slice culture and outgrowth assay
Entorhinal cortex slices were prepared at postnatal day 2 from mouse
brains as described earlier (Hechler et al. 2006; Schmitt et al. 2007;
Boato et al. 2010). Dissection of entorhinal cortex slices was
performed in ice-cold MEM, with 2 mM L-glutamine and 8 mM Tris
base added. Using a tissue chopper (Bachhofer, Reutlingen, Ger-
many) transverse slices of 350 lmwere cut. Slices were embedded in
a collagen I matrix on glass slides. For cultivation, MEM supple-
mented with 25% Hank‘s Balanced Salt Solution, 25% heat-
inactivated normal horse serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 4 lg/mL insulin
(Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany), 2.4 mg/mL glucose (Braun, Melsun-
gen, Germany), 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and
800 ng/mL ascorbic acid (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen,
Germany) was used. Cultures were kept at 37C and 5%CO2 for 48 h
(with C3 peptides added) before microscopic analysis.
Axon counting
For measurement of axonal outgrowth from the explants, neurites of
the explant were evaluated at a total magnification of 200, using a 20
times Olympus LCPLANFL objective (Olympus IX70, Hamburg,
Germany). Axons that crossed a virtual line running at a distance of
100 lm parallel to the border of the concave explant side were
counted.
Re-innervation assay
To analyze re-innervation of the denervated hippocampus in vitro an
assay was used which combines an entorhinal cortex of a b-actin-
eGFP+ mouse with a hippocampus of a wild-type littermate. The
entorhinal-hippocampal eGFP slice cultures were prepared from
mouse brains at day 2 post-partum as described elsewhere (Hechler
et al. 2006). In brief, transverse hippocampal slices (350 lm) from
wild-type animals were placed on membranes (Millicell-CM,
Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) adjacent to eGFP+ entorhinal cortex
slices, rearranging in vitro the correct anatomy of the hippocampal
formation in vivo. The slices were kept at 5% CO2 at 37 C. The
medium contained 50% MEM, 25% BME basal medium, 25% heat-
inactivated normal horse serum, 2 mM glutamax (all Gibco) and
0.65% glucose (Braun), adjusted to pH 7.2. Slice co-cultures were
treated for 48 h with C3bot peptides. After treatment, the entorhinal-
hippocampal eGFP slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
0.5% glutaraldehyde.
Measurement of axonal ingrowth (re-innervation)
To evaluate the axonal ingrowth from GFP-positive entorhinal
cortices into the GFP-negative hippocampal target tissue, the GFP-
labeled fibers, which had grown into the hippocampus, were
photodocumented with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX50)
and a Photometrics CoolSNAPTMES camera (VisitronSystems
GmbH, Munich, Germany). Photomicrographs were then analyzed
with MetaMorph Image Software (VisitronSystems GmbH) to
determine the average intensity in a standardized area, including the
interface entorhinal cortex/hippocampus and the perforant path. The
values from the experimental cultures were compared with control
cultures prepared in the same experiment. Subsequently, the data of
multiple experiments were pooled for statistical analysis. After
confirming that significant differences existed between groups by
performing a Kruskal–Wallis Test, p-values (significance level of
0.05) were determined, using a Mann–Whitney U test (applies both
to outgrowth and re-innervation assay).
Experimental spinal cord injury
Compression injury
Spinal cord compression injury was performed as described
previously (Sieber-Blum et al. 2006; Boato et al. 2010). Briefly,
9- to 11-week-old anesthetized Balb/C mice (20–24 g) underwent a
dorsal laminectomy at thoracic level T8, and a compression lesion
was performed with a SPI Correx tension/compression gauge (Penn
Tool, Maplewood, MN, USA) modified with the feeler bended to a
90 degree angle, and with a flat 1.25 mm tip designed to precisely fit
in the cavity created by the laminectomy. Compression of the mouse
spinal cord was then performed by two investigators (both blinded
to experimental groups, one compressing the spinal cord and the
other double checking pressure and time applied to each animal) at
20 cN for 1 s. Under these conditions, this injury type approximates
the rapid force/acceleration injuries common to weight drop models.
After positioning of the gelfoam patch on top of the perforated dura,
the muscles were sutured and the back skin closed with wound clips.
Dorsal hemisection
For the spinal cord bilateral dorsal hemisection, iridectomy scissors
were used to transect left and right dorsal funiculus, the dorsal horns
(Simonen et al. 2003) and additionally the ventral funiculus (to cut
also the small proportion of ventrally running corticospinal as well
as raphespinal fibers close to the midline). Thus, the hemisection
resulted in a complete transection of dorsal and medio-ventral
descending fiber tracts (Boato et al. 2010). Following this proce-
dure, mice were treated as described above. Both spinal cord injury
(SCI) procedures were performed under a Leica MS5 stereo
microscope.
Locomotion tests
Mice were continuously tested for functional recovery three weeks
following SCI with the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS; Basso et al.
2006). The BMS is a 10-point locomotor rating scale (9 = normal
locomotion; 0 = complete hind limb paralysis), in which mice are
scored by two investigators blinded to experimental groups based on

hind limb movements made in an open field during a 4-min interval.
After allowing mice to recover for 5 days, Rotarod performance
(Sheng et al. 2004) was determined continuously up to the end of
the observation periods. The mice were placed on an accelerated
rolling rod (Ugo Basile, Comeris VA, Italy). The latency to jump off
from the rod was automatically recorded by the action of the mouse
dropping onto a trigger plate. For BMS analysis we used the mean
of the left and right hindlimb scores for each animal. Rotarod and
BMS data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA as previously
described (Basso et al. 2006) and represent mean values for all the
animals of each experimental group ± SEM.
Rho GTPase pull-down assay
Pull-down assays to detect activated RhoA in spinal cord tissue were
performed using a Rho activation assay kit according to manufac-
turer‘s instructions (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO, USA). Briefly,
dissected pieces of spinal cord of 1 cm length that included the
lesioned area were obtained from PBS-perfused animals, homogen-
ated and lysed in lysis buffer. The soluble fraction was obtained by
centrifugation (10 500 g for 2 min). Aliquots were saved for
analysis of total RhoA and loading control. Lysates were then
added to rhotekin-RBD beads for 1 h (4C). Pelleted beads were
washed three times, and bound proteins were mobilized by
incubation with Laemmli sample buffer at 95C for 5 min. Samples
were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and western blot analysis.
Histological analysis of spinal cord tissue
Spinal cord cryosections (20 lm) from transcardially perfused
animals were preincubated with 10% normal goat serum dissolved
in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 20C.
Incubation with primary antibodies was carried out overnight at
4C. Following repeated washing steps with PBS, secondary
antibodies were applied for 2 h at 20C. After removal of unbound
antibodies, sections were mounted.
Quantification of GABAergic and serotonergic inputs to lumbar
a-motoneurons
a-motorneurons of lumbar segments 1–2 (L1–L2) of the most
ventral part of the ventral horn (representing Rexed‘s lamina 9)
were analyzed. The number of VGAT-positive inputs (vesicular
GABA transporter) and 5HT-positive boutons on motoneurons was
calculated according to the criteria given elsewhere (Müllner et al.
2008). Briefly, 5HT-positive swellings and VGAT-positive spots
directly contacting a-motoneuron somata were counted in relation
to the cell body perimeter as measured by Leica Application Suite
software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Measurements
are expressed as number of boutons (spots) per 100 lm cell
perimeter.
Results
To investigate putative growth-promoting effects of short
peptides derived from Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase
(C3bot) on hippocampal neurons, we generated different
peptides from a sequence comprising the amino acids 154–
182 known to exhibit neurotrophic activity (Höltje et al.
2009). In one of the peptides, the catalytic glutamate at
position 174 was exchanged for glutamine (C3bot154)182
E174Q referred to as C3bot 29mer E174Q). Four peptides
represented further truncated versions of the original 29
amino acid sequence: C3bot156)181 or C3bot 26mer,
C3bot160)179 or C3bot 20mer, C3bot163)177 or C3bot
15mer and C3bot163)174 or C3bot 12mer (Fig. 1a). Finally,
a peptide that flanked the initial 29mer to the C-terminal end
was used covering the amino acids 181–211 (C3bot 31mer).
To test for beneficial effects on neuronal outgrowth murine
hippocampal cultures kept under serum-free conditions were
incubated with 50 nM of the respective peptides for four
days. In contrast to full length C3bot, these peptides harbour
no enzymatic activity as expected and already demonstrated
for the initial 29mer (Höltje et al. 2009). Following incuba-
tion, fixed neurons were stained for axonal neurofilament
protein and dendritic microtubule-associated protein 2
(Map2) as markers for axons and dendrites, respectively,
and were morphometrically analysed. The rationale for the
use of the modified 29mer peptide with glutamine instead of
glutamate at position 174 (essential for catalytic function of
full length protein), was to check whether this residue is also
involved in peptide effects on neuronal morphology. Treat-
ment of hippocampal neurons with C3bot 29mer E174Q
indeed enhanced axon and dendrite length. Complexity of
branching, on the other hand, was not significantly altered
(Fig. 1b and e). The four further shortened peptides were
designed to pinpoint the minimal length of C3bot-derived
fragments to foster neuronal outgrowth with the shortest one
reflecting the 12 amino acid of the ARTT loop responsible
for substrate recognition of the full length C3bot transferase.
In addition, the C-terminal 31mer was used to demonstrate
whether an inclusion of substantial parts of the residues
located between position 154 and 182 is essential for
biological activity. Following incubation with the respective
peptides two candidates exhibited promoting effects on
neuronal process growth: C3bot 26mer (Fig. 1c and e)
resulted in a significant promotion of axonal and dendritic
length and, in addition, enhanced the complexity of branch-
ing in these two compartments. Application of the shorter
C3bot 15mer also resulted in the promotion of axonal length
and branching, effects on dendrite morphology, however, did
not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1c and e). The other
three peptides were without effects on the parameters
studied. Therefore, the 29mer peptide seems to be effective
even with an amino acid exchange at a critical position, and
certain further truncated peptides still exhibit beneficial
effects on the morphology of cultivated neurons. Next, we
addressed the question whether the observed morphological
effects elicited by the shorter C3bot 26mer and C3bot 15mer
were accompanied by functional changes such as the number
of synaptic inputs. To this end, we quantified the number of
synaptophysin-positive terminals contacting the proximal
dendrites of individual eGFP-transfected neurons
(Fig. 2a). Using NeMo software (Henneberger et al. 2005)

synaptophysin-expressing inputs that contacted proximal
dendrites were counted based on size and intensity criteria.
Incubation with C3bot 26mer enhanced the level of connec-
tivity by about 50% (Fig. 2b and c). Accompanying Western
blot analysis confirmed an increased expression of synapt-
ophysin together with a higher level of dendritic Map2
expression in cultures treated with C3bot 26mer (Fig. 2d).
Despite its beneficial effects at least on axonal morphology
C3bot 15mer was without effect on the number of synaptic
inputs (Fig. 2e). Also, incubation with C3bot 20mer or
C3bot 12mer did not result in any detectable effects on
general synaptic connectivity in culture as tested for non-
transfected neurons (Figure S1, C3bot 26mer was used as
positive control). To investigate the efficacy of C3bot
peptides to act also on growth-inhibitory substrate we
cultivated hippocampal cultures on extracellular matrix
constituents such as chondroitinsulfate proteoglycans
(CSPG), which are strongly secreted in response to lesions
of the CNS. CSPGs are known to act as RhoA activators
(Schweigreiter et al. 2004). The growth of hippocampal
neurons on CSPG substrate exhibited a reduced morpholog-
ical complexity (Fig. 2f) and, presumably as a consequence
of that, also expressed less synaptic contacts than neurons
grown on normal substrate (Fig. 2g). Incubation with C3bot
26mer, but not C3bot 15mer, however, prevented this CSPG-
induced loss of synaptic contacts (Fig. 2g). So, albeit lacking

metrically quantified using Neurolucida

effects. N = 3 or more experiments, data

(probability of occurrence in %). C3bot 26mer shifts the number of
inputs to higher values. N = 3 or more experiments, data were taken

neurons (C3bot 15mer). Experiments were repeated at least three
times. (f, g) Parallel cultures were cultivated on growth-inhibitory
chondroitinsulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) substrate and synaptic

resembles more closely the in vivo situation than dissociation
culture since all the cell populations of the brain are present
in the brain explants, and additionally it allows for a more
exact control of experimental conditions than in the animal
model. Murine entorhinal cortex explant cultures (Fig. 3a
and b) were then incubated with medium only, C3bot 26mer
or C3bot 15mer for 48 h. Subsequently, the number of
outgrowing axons comprising the perforant path in the intact
brain was quantified. Incubation with C3bot 26mer enhanced
the number of axons by 35% compared with control
conditions (Fig. 3c and d). Treatment with C3bot 15mer on
the other hand was without any effect. Another organotypical
culture system was used to investigate the growth-promoting
effects of C3bot peptides: we applied an eGFP/wild-type
co-culture model that combines the entorhinal cortex of a
b-actin-eGFP mouse with the hippocampus of a wild-type
mouse. eGFP-expressing axons of the perforant path were
clearly detectable and quantifiable in the non-fluorescent
wild-type hippocampus. Slices were treated as described for
the outgrowth model. An increased re-innervation of the
hippocampus by perforant path fibers was detected after
application of C3bot 26mer (measured as an increase in
fluorescence intensity by 50%). Again, no effects were
observed for C3bot 15mer (Fig. 3e and f).
In the light of these findings, we refrained from a further
use of C3bot 15mer and, instead, applied the more
promising 26mer in the subsequent in vivo experiments.
Using either compression injury model of the spinal cord or
a dorsal hemisection lesion paradigm at thoracic level T8

regain of motor function in the BMS open field test (Basso
et al. 1995) and Rotarod experiments as a forced movement
test system. Animals were operated and gel-foam patches
soaked with 5 lL of 40 lM C3bot 26mer (790 ng/
animal) or PBS were applied directly at the injury site on
top of the perforated dura. The gelfoam patch remained in
the animals for the entire time of investigation. According
to the BMS behavioural tests, animals treated with the
peptide showed an improved recovery from both types of
injury than mice that received PBS only (Fig. 4a and b).
After both contusion injury and spinal hemisection, mice
gained relatively constant score points two weeks after
surgery. Mice treated with C3bot 26mer reached values 1.5
score points higher than the control group. As previously
shown (Boato et al. 2010) this model of dorsal hemisection
in general represented a more severe form of lesion. A
beneficial effect of the C3bot peptide on locomotor
recovery was also detectable in the Rotarod experiments,
and in case of hemisection it reached significance (Fig. 4c
and d). Following hemisection, motor performance of either
group was more affected than after contusion injury,
confirming the BMS data.
For the 29mer, enhanced recovery of motor function
following SCI was reflected by an improved serotonergic
input to lumbar motoneurons, a part of them being engaged
in hind limb muscle control (Boato et al. 2010). In this
context, we asked whether incubation with C3bot 26mer (and
C3bot 29mer) also had an effect on inhibitory GABA- and
glycinergic input to these neurons after spinal hemisection. In
this injury model fiber tracts are transected and allow for the
study of neuronal plasticity and regeneration. Following
completion of the behavioural experiments shown before,
spinal cord sections were stained for the vesicular GABA /
glycine transporter VGAT and 5-HT. First, we counted
VGAT-positive spots contacting the somata of lumbar a-
motoneurons at levels L1-L2 in the ventral horn (Fig. 5a and
b). However, no detectable alterations in the average number
of inhibitory inputs were detected after treatment with C3bot
26mer. This holds true also for C3bot 29mer (data not
shown). On the other hand, quantification of serotonergic
boutons contacting these motoneurons revealed a 2-fold
increase after treatment with this peptide (Fig. 5c).
Next, we addressed the question whether treatment with
C3bot peptides impacts on RhoA activation in the spinal

ration following spinal cord injury by compression or hemisection. Mice
were subjected to two different experimental spinal cord injury (SCI)
models. At thoracic level T8, either a compression injury or a dorsal
hemisection were conducted. Mice were allowed to recover for
approximately three weeks. The regain of motor function was evalu-
ated by open field and forced movement tests. (a, b) C3bot 26mer
application (40 lM/5 lL) significantly increased the performance

cord after lesion. This issue was tested for the hemisection
model. By performing pull-down assays we analysed active
(GTP-bound) RhoA levels from lysates of spinal cord
fragments that included the lesion area (Fig. 6a) or the
laminectomy site in sham-operated animals. Two time points
were chosen, one at 24 h and the other at 7 days after
surgery. In addition to C3bot 26mer, C3bot 29mer was also
tested in vivo because of its known effect on RhoA
activation in vitro.
As expected, active RhoA (RhoA-GTP) showed a ten-
dency to be up-regulated 24 h after surgery compared with
sham-operated mice that exhibited only weak RhoA-GTP
signals (Fig. 6b and c). However, the two peptides did not
clearly affect RhoA activation. However, RhoA activation
was still prominent 7 days after surgery in PBS animals but
was clearly reduced in mice that received treatment with
C3bot 26mer or 29mer (Fig. 6b and c).
In conclusion, we were able to show in this study that a
fragment of C3bot covering 26 amino acid residues is able to
stimulate neuronal outgrowth and connectivity in different in
vitro and in vivo systems. A further truncation of the
fragment to 15 amino acid residues largely constricts the
neuronal growth promoting effects. Other peptides were
completely inactive in the experimental settings applied.
Discussion
The primary goal of the present study was to investigate the
minimum length of Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase to
sufficiently exhibit beneficial effects on neuronal process
growth, connectivity and regeneration following CNS lesion.
Additionally, interactions with putative downstream partners
such as the small GTPase RhoA, generally considered as a
negative regulator of neuronal regeneration, were examined.
The data reveal that a 26-amino acid fragment from C3bot
encompassing the residues 156–181 is sufficient to produce
promoting effects in a wide range of experimental settings
dealing with neuronal growth and interaction. Behavioural
experiments indicate that treatment of SCI-injured mice with
this fragment results in improved locomotor restoration
probably involving C3bot peptide-mediated reduced RhoA
activation in the spinal cord. Further shortening of the
peptide resulted in partial or even complete loss of activity in
the applications tested.

Morphological measurements
First, we addressed the question whether the exact amino
acid sequence covering the so-called ARTT-loop (Han et al.
2001) included in all the peptides used is essential even
for its non-enzymatic action. Application of C3bot 29mer
with glutamate 174 exchanged still exhibited promoting
effects on process elongation comparable to the initially
designed 29mer, effects by the modified 29mer on axonal
and dendritic branching, however, were not significant
(for comparison, see Höltje et al. 2009). Noteworthy,
elongation and branching crucial for network assembly are
distinct mechanisms that are differentially regulated (Kalil
et al. 2000; Hall and Lalli 2010). Branching mechanisms
often include Rac activity (Albertinazzi et al. 1998) and
Cdc42-governed filopodia extension (Kakimoto et al. 2006)
that are obviously not affected by this peptide. For dendrite
branching, that was promoted by C3bot 26mer, it was shown
that activated RhoA acts to inhibit expression of a protein
named cypin and, by doing so, decreases dendrite complexity
(Chen and Firestein 2007).The observation that C3bot 12mer
(identical to the ARTT loop) representing the shortest
peptide used exhibited no activity on cultured neurons

RhoA levels were increased 24 h after surgery in PBS, 29mer-
(C3bot154–182), and C3bot 26mer-treated mice compared with sham-
operated animals. Sustained RhoA activation was still detected one
week after injury in PBS animals, which was reduced in mice treated
with the C3bot peptides. Proper assay function was controlled by
addition of the non-hydrolyzable G protein activator GTPcS as positive
control and GDP as negative control to lysates from a sham-operated
mouse. (c) Quantification of RhoA-GTP levels by LabImage software

further underlines the fact that the exact ARTT loop alone is
not sufficient for enzyme-independent neurotrophic action.
Also, regions closer to the C-terminal end of C3bot do not
seem to contribute to the beneficial effects because the C-
terminal 31mer was without effects. An open question
remains, why the 15mer, but not the 20mer, exhibited
axonotrophic activity. This was surprising, since the 20mer
includes the 15mer sequence. Most likely the three-dimen-
sional structure of the peptide or the property to dimerize/
oligomerize is the basis for the axonotrophic activity.
We were able to show that C3bot 26mer (and C3bot
29mer) can inhibit RhoA activation. The fact, that C3bot
26mer promotes axon outgrowth and re-innervation in
organotypical culture systems further strengthens the data
already obtained for the 29mer (Höltje et al. 2009) and
confirms the effects observed in dissociation culture for more
complex culture systems. Interestingly, the 15-amino acid
fragment was without effect in brain slice culture despite its
effectiveness on axon growth in primary dissociation culture.
Given the working hypothesis that C3bot peptides bind to a
neuronal receptor structure to achieve their effects (reviewed
in Just et al. 2011) one must assume that the 15mer falls
below a critical length for acting as a ligand, at least for
receptors expressed on the surface of neurons cultivated in
their organotypical context, obtained from postnatal animals
(dissociation cultures represent neurons prepared at embry-
onic stage).
Synaptic connectivity
Analysis of synaptic connectivity in primary culture revealed
promoting effects of C3bot 26mer, but not C3bot 15mer (or
other peptides ineffective also in morphometrical measure-
ments) on the number of synaptic inputs. The observed
higher number of synaptic contacts corresponds with the
increased dendritic length and branching detected after
application of C3bot 26mer, a phenomenon that was not
seen in cultures treated with C3bot 15mer. The effects on
synaptophysin and Map2 elicited by the 26mer were also
evident when analysed by Western blot analysis. Moreover,
treatment with C3bot 26mer prevented CSPG-mediated
down-regulation of synaptic inputs. Inhibitory effects of
extracellular matrix components such as CSPG achieve their
inhibitory effects on neuronal growth largely by signalling
pathways which converges on RhoA activation (Schweigre-
iter et al. 2004). In accordance to our observations for axonal
and dendritic growth of cultivated hippocampal neurons in
the current study and in our earlier observation (Boato et al.
2010), it was shown that CSPG treatment can result in a
strong reduction of neuronal growth by up to 50% (Shen
et al. 2009). So, it appears very likely that the observed
reduced synaptic input in cultures grown on CSPG without
peptide reflects the reduced possibility to establish inter-
neuronal connections in the absence of an extensive network
of neuronal processes. However, impairment of RhoA
signalling by C3bot 26mer seems to be a likely mechanism
by which its beneficial effects on (functional) neuronal
outgrowth are achieved.
In addition to the in vitro experiments, effects of C3bot
26mer on neuronal connectivity were also investigated for
the input to lumbar a-motoneurons after spinal cord injury in
mice. In a previous study we were able to show that
application of C3bot154)182 (C3bot 29mer) enhances the
number of regenerating corticospinal fibers following tho-
racic SCI (Boato et al. 2010). Complementing the improved
regenerational growth of glutamatergic corticospinal fibers
(Rekling et al. 2000), we detected a higher number of
serotonergic inputs to lumbar motoneurons in animals treated
with C3bot 29mer. Serotonergic brainstem fibers set spinal
motoneurons in an excitable state rendering them ready to
cause muscle contraction mainly by activation of 5-HT2C
receptors, regulating persisting Ca2+ and Na+ currents (Li
et al. 2007; Murray et al. 2010). In the present study, we
could show a positive effect for C3bot 26mer on serotonergic
input to lumbar a-motoneurons, but we were unable to detect
changes in inhibitory GABAergic/glycinergic input to these
neurons in mice treated with C3bot 26mer. One possible
explanation for this differential outcome might be that the
peptides were applied locally at the site of spinal cord injury
(T8) 6–7 segments above the localization of the lumbar
motoneurons (L1–L2). By using this form of application
descending fibers that pass or regenerate through the thoracic
lesion area might benefit from the peptide effect, rather than
inhibitory fibers originating from local inhibitory interneu-
rons localized to lumbar segments.
Clinical outcome after spinal cord injury
In this study, we used two different models of experimental
spinal cord injury, compression injury and hemisection.
While the former reflects the most frequent type of injury in
humans (Sekhon and Fehlings 2001), the latter might
produce a more defined lesion and is better suited to study
truly regenerating fibers. The behavioural data clearly show
an improved recovery of the treatment group (C3bot 26mer)
compared with the control group after either form of lesion.
This could reflect an increase in the intrinsic plasticity of the
spinal cord axons resulting in regeneration of axotomized
axons or collateral sprouting of unlesioned tracts. Alterna-
tively, the effects could be due to enhanced sparing of spinal
tissue, particularly in the case of the compression injury.
Moreover, it can be assumed that the observed increase in
serotonergic input to lumbar motoneurons in mice which
underwent hemisection, results from enhanced regenerative
growth of raphespinal fibers or increased neuroprotection
mediated by the peptide, as observed in the case of C3bot
29mer (Boato et al. 2010). A dominant role of serotonin for
spinal motoneuron excitability has been demonstrated
repeatedly (Harvey et al. 2006; Ung et al. 2008; Boido
et al. 2009).

C3bot peptides and RhoA activation
Despite the lack of ADP-ribosylating activity, C3bot peptide-
mediated effects on neuronal outgrowth still seem to be
based on Rho-dependent signaling mechanisms. Evidence
for this comes from pull-down studies that detected a reduced
RhoA activation in spinal cord tissue one week after
experimental SCI in mice treated with C3bot 26mer and
29mer. Up-regulation of Rho proteins following SCI is
considered to be a p75 neurotrophin receptor-dependent
process and represents a hallmark in the cellular responses to
this type of injury (Yamashita and Tohyama 2003; Conrad
et al. 2005; McKerracher and Higuchi 2006). Increased
levels of activated RhoA seem to account to a great extent for
axonal growth-inhibition following CNS lesions. So far, the
exact molecular events resulting in RhoA inhibition by
C3bot peptides remain elusive. Putative mechanisms include
binding to a neuronal receptor to trigger intracellular
signaling pathways. Alternatively, a putative receptor would
only mediate uptake of C3bot peptides to act in an
intracellular way. A direct non-enzymatic interaction of
C3bot with intracellular targets was shown for the small
GTPase RalA (Wilde et al. 2002), but can be excluded for
C3bot peptides (I. Just, unpublished observations). Never-
theless, non-enzymatic interaction of C3bot peptides with
RhoA is also detectable in cultured hippocampal neurons
(Boato et al. 2010) leading to the assumption that this indeed
represents a general mechanism of action to promote
neuronal outgrowth by short C3bot-derived peptides.
Overall, the present study clearly demonstrates the high
potential of the 26-amino acid peptide C3bot156)181 to
stimulate the limited intrinsic repair mechanisms in the CNS
after lesion. Further truncation of the peptide sequence
results in substantial loss of function. It is conceivable, that
the length of the peptides defines the range of activated
cellular effectors. Compared with the use of wild-type C3
exoenzyme, the use of neuron-specific enzyme-deficient C3
peptides to stimulate neuronal growth processes seems to be
favourable especially in the in vivo situation. Observations
from our laboratory showed that application of C3bot wild
type at equimolar dose to C3bot peptides after SCI resulted in
serious unwanted side effects including death in half of the
animals tested. Although the detailed reasons for this
observation yet remain to be determined, it is tempting to
assume that they are linked to ubiquitous effects mediated by
C3bot on various cell types not shared by C3bot peptides.
