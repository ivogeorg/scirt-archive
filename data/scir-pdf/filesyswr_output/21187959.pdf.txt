Abstract
The aim of this study is to understand if human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and neuropeptide pituitary adenylate
cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) have synergistic protective effect that promotes functional recovery in rats with
severe spinal cord injury (SCI). To evaluate the effect of delayed combinatorial therapy of PACAP and hMSCs on spinal cord
tissue repair, we used the immortalized hMSCs that retain their potential of neuronal differentiation under the stimulation of
neurogenic factors and possess the properties for the production of several growth factors beneficial for neural cell survival.
The results indicated that delayed treatment with PACAP and hMSCs at day 7 post SCI increased the remaining neuronal
fibers in the injured spinal cord, leading to better locomotor functional recovery in SCI rats when compared to treatment
only with PACAP or hMSCs. Western blotting also showed that the levels of antioxidant enzymes, Mn-superoxide dismutase
(MnSOD) and peroxiredoxin-1/6 (Prx-1 and Prx-6), were increased at the lesion center 1 week after the delayed treatment
with the combinatorial therapy when compared to that observed in the vehicle-treated control. Furthermore, in vitro
studies showed that co-culture with hMSCs in the presence of PACAP not only increased a subpopulation of microglia
expressing galectin-3, but also enhanced the ability of astrocytes to uptake extracellular glutamate. In summary, our in vivo
and in vitro studies reveal that delayed transplantation of hMSCs combined with PACAP provides trophic molecules to
promote neuronal cell survival, which also foster beneficial microenvironment for endogenous glia to increase their
neuroprotective effect on the repair of injured spinal cord tissue.

Introduction
A traumatic primary injury to the spinal cord (SCI) induces
axonal degeneration, neural cell death, and microvasculature
destruction. These events subsequently trigger a cascade of
pathological actions (so called secondary damage) including
vascular and biochemical changes, hemorrhagic necrosis, inflam-
matory process and demyelination [1,2], leading to a second wave
of cell death and lesion area extension which impair the affected
body functions. Moreover, poor trophic support environment of
the adult central nervous system (CNS) is hostile to endogenous
spinal cord regeneration. The findings from recent biomedical
research have indicated promising cell therapies for SCI treatment
by utilizing various types of multipotent stem cells such as
embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells/
bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs/BMSCs), adipose tissue-derived
mesenchymal stem cells, and umbilical cord blood cells [3,4,5,6].
Human MSCs/BMSCs are multipotent stem cells which can
differentiate into several tissue cell types such as neural cells,
adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and hematopoiesis-support-
ing stroma, thereby making hMSCs/hBMSCs as promising
candidates for regenerative medicine. Moreover, hMSCs/
hBMSCs are beneficial for the purpose of autologous transplan-
tation, raising the promising possibility that the cells can be used
for stem cell-based approach to treat several neurodegenerative
diseases, such as stroke, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral
Sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and SCI [7]. Cumulative evidence
shows that the transplantation with BMSCs into injured spinal
cord caused axonal growth in the lesion site and produced partially
functional recovery in SCI rats [5,8,9,10]. The findings from
several laboratories have also indicated that BMSCs may play a
guiding role in fostering host axons to grow in the grafted spinal
cord after being transplanted into the injured spinal cord
[11,12,13]. Moreover, it has been indicated that delivery of
BMSCs 1 week after injury significantly cell survival and improves
the hindlimb locomotor function in animals with moderate SCI
[12]. These findings point to the promise of bone marrow derived
cell-based strategy for potential SCI repair.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a
member of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)/glucagon
peptide family, provokes cAMP production and regulates
neurogenesis, neuroprotection and axonal regeneration [14,15,
16,17]. Our previous studies demonstrated that PACAP increased
neural cell survival in the contused spinal cord tissue [18] and
induced hMSCs to differentiate into neuron-like cells [19]. This
molecule also shows immunomodulatory action on immune cells,
such as microglia and macrophages. For example, PACAP can
suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced neurotoxicity in mixed neu-
ron/glia culture [20], and it has an inhibitory effect on tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) production in injured spinal cords
[21]. A recent study also indicates that endogenous PACAP
mediates regulatory T cell production in the inflamed CNS, which
in turn exerts neuroprotection in experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis [22].
The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential of
combinatorial therapy using hMSCs and PACAP for spinal cord
tissue repair. The life span of primary hMSCs used in our previous
study is short due to replicative senescence [19,23]. The primary
MSCs that are harvested from patients with disease- or age-
differences may produce inconsistent results. Accordingly, we used
an immortalized hMSC cell line that was generated by
transducing with HPV16 E6/E7 genes [23] and further
nucleoporated with a plasmid containing human telomerase.
The immortalized hMSCs not only were transdiffereniated into
neuronal-like cells in response to neurogenic agents, but also
highly secreted growth factors, neurotrophic factors, and cyto-
kines/chemokines. Delayed combinatorial treatment with hMSCs
and PACAP was observed to significantly improve hindlimb
locomotion in SCI rats. Through in vitro co-culture system using
the hMSC cell line and primary rat astrocytes, we provided
evidence that the hMSC-derived factors increased the production
of membrane glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) in astrocytes under
the influence of PACAP and promoted astrocytic glutamate
uptake activity. These results showed that delayed transplantation
of hMSCs in combination with PACAP administration synergis-
tically improves microenvironment beneficial for the spinal tissue
repair after traumatic SCI.
Results
Neurodifferentiation and trophic factor secretion of
immortalized hMSCs
The potential of immortalized hMSCs toward neuronal
differentiation was first tested. When compared to the control
culture, the differentiated cells with positive immunostaining for
internexin (a marker for neuronal precursor) and synapsin-1 (a
synapse vesicle protein) displayed more elongated processes after
treatment with PACAP (20 ng/ml) and other neurogenic agents
including dbcAMP, b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME), and retinoic acid
(RA) for 24 hours (Figure 1, arrows). In addition, dbcAMP and b-
ME induced extensive branching in differentiated hMSCs
(Figure 1B and E, arrowheads). The results support the view that
the immortalized hMSCs retain the property of their transdiffer-
entiation into neuronal-like cells.
Furthermore, through an antibody array analysis (Figure 2), we
found that hMSCs used in this study secreted profusely several
growth factors, neurotrophic factors, and cytokines, such as
angiogenin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), granulocyte/macro-
phage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), insulin-like growth
factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-2/4, brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), bone morphogenetic proteins-4 (BMP-4), neuro-
trophin-3 (NT-3), platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP-1). The results indicate that hMSCs used in this study can
serve as a trophic factor-producing source that may assist tissue
repair in the injured spinal cord.
Basso Beattie Bresnahan score increased by
combinatorial treatment with PACAP and hMSCs
SCI can induce extreme inflammation in the first week after
SCI [1]. The study indicated that administration of rat MSCs one
week after SCI led to better survival of transplanted cells than
immediate transplantation [12]. Accordingly, delayed transplan-
tation of hMSCs combined with PACAP was conducted at day 7
post SCI (Figure 3A). Immunofluorescence for human nuclei
(HuNu) showed that many transplanted hMSCs were still present
in the injected site at week 1 post transplantation (Figure 3B), while
the transplanted cells were scarcely observed at week 2 post
transplantation (unpublished observations of Lin and Tzeng).
Although the in vitro study has shown that hMSCs can undergo
neuronal differentiation under the influence of PACAP (Figure 1),
we did not detect new neurons derived from hMSCs at the
injected site and lesion center at week 1 post transplantation
(unpublished observations of Lin and Tzeng). This raises the
possibility that the transplanted hMSCs combined with PACAP
might rather reconstitute niche in the support of the tissue repair,
than contribute to the generation of new neurons in the injured
spinal cord. Thus, the profile of differential protein expression in
the lesion center was studied using the proteomic analysis. In
comparison to the expression levels of proteins involving
antioxidation/oxidoreduction in vehicle-treated groups, the inten-
sity of Prx-1, Prx-6, and MnSOD was upregulated by 50% in
animals with delayed transplantation of hMSCs combined with
PACAP (Table S1 and Figure S1). Indeed, western blotting
showed that the levels of the three proteins were increased by
delayed treatment by PACAP and hMSCs compared to that in the
vehicle-treated group (Figure 3C). Moreover, increased levels of
Prx-1 and Prx-6 were observed in PACAP-treated animals
compared to that in the group receiving hMSC transplantation
or treatment with PACAP and hMSCs (Figure 3C). The results
provide evidence showing the effect of the combinatorial treatment
on oxidant defense in the injured spinal cord.
The hindlimb locomotor function was assessed by Basso Beattie
Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale at day 31 post SCI. As
shown in Figure 3C, the BBB score for the SCI rats receiving
delayed transplantation of hMSCs was 5.060.4 (n = 4). The values
were not biostatically different from those observed in SCI rats
with PBS injection. The scores in vehicle-treated rats (2.060.1;
n = 3) were similar to the ones indicated by the previous studies
[24,25]. Delayed administration of PACAP into the injured spinal
cord did not induce significant increase in hindlimb locomotor
function when compared to vehicle-treated rats having severe
locomotor deficit (Figure 3C). However, the locomotion in SCI
rats receiving the delayed combinatorial treatment by PACAP and
hMSCs (3.862.1) was improved at day 31 post SCI with
significantly increased BBB score (9.861.2; n = 6), which corre-
sponds to weight-supported plantar steps, but no coordination of
forelimb and hindlimb [26].
The spinal cord tissue sections collected at day 31 post SCI from
the four animal groups were subjected to immunofluorescence to
examine the remaining neuronal fibers in the injured spinal cord.
Numerous calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)-positive
neuronal fibers were only found in the dorsal portion of the lesion
center of SCI rats receiving the delayed combinatorial treatment
by PACAP and hMSCs (Figure 4D, arrows). Note that CGRP-
positive neuronal fibers were scarcely observed in the lesion center

of vehicle-treated control (Figure 4A), PACAP-treated (Figure 4B)
and hMSC-treated animal groups (Figure 4C). Moreover, we
found that more orientated elongated neurofilament-200 kDa
(NF)-positive neuronal fibers scattered through the lesion center in
the injured spinal cord receiving the delayed combinatorial
treatment by PACAP and hMSCs (Figure 4H, arrows), when
compared to the vehicle-treated control, which had NF-positive
neuronal debris (Figure 4E, arrowheads), and collapsed fragment-
ed NF-positive neuronal fibers (Figure 4E, arrow). However,
numerous fine fragmented neuronal fibers with NF-positive

treated for 24 hours in serum-free ITS medium with several neurogenic factors, dbcAMP (0.1 mM), PACAP (20 ng/ml), b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME;
1 mM), and retinoic acid (RA; 0.1 mM). The cultures were subjected to immunofluorescence staining for a-internexin (A–F) or synapsin (G–L). Arrows

immunostaining remained in the injured spinal cord tissues treated
with delayed infusion by hMSCs (Figure 4F, arrows) or PACAP
(Figure 4G, arrows). Furthermore, there was evidence of numerous
extending growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) immunoreactive
neuronal fibers in the injured spinal cords proximal to the lesion
center in the rats receiving the delayed combinatorial treatment by
PACAP and hMSCs (Figure 4L, arrows). However, neuronal fiber
fragments with GAP-43 immunoreactivity were observed in the
injured center of PACAP-treated or hMSC-transplanted spinal
cord (Figure 4J and 4K, open arrows). Note that there was GAP-
43-positive cell debris in the injured spinal cord of the PBS-treated
control, although a few GAP-43-positive neuronal fibers were also
observed (Figure 4I, arrowheads). Together with the behavioral
analysis, the high density of the neuronal fibers in the injured
spinal cord correlates to partially restoration in the weight support
in rats which received the delayed combined treatment by PACAP
and hMSCs.
By glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining, we
further observed that astrocytes displayed a hypertropic morphol-
ogy in the injured spinal cord at week 2 post a contusive injury
(Figure 5A, arrows). Moreover, the appearance of GFAP-positive
astrocytes in the injured spinal cord receiving PACAP (Figure 5B,
arrows) or hMSCs (Figure 5C, arrow) was hypertrophic. However,
the extension of astrocytic processes was observed in the injured
spinal cord with delayed combinatorial treatment by PACAP and
hMSCs (Figure 5D, arrowheads). In addition, ionized calcium-
binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) positive microglia in the
injured spinal cord by delayed treatment with PACAP and hMSCs
displayed an amoeboid-like shape (Fig. 5H, arrowheads), while
there were small round Iba-1 stained microglia scattered through
the lesion center of the spinal cord in either PACAP-treated
(Figure 5F) or hMSC-treated spinal cord (Figure 5G). Note that
Iba-1 positive microglia in the vehicle-treated spinal cord tissues
mainly displayed a unipolar shape (Figure 5E, arrows). The
observations reveal that delayed combinatorial treatment by
PACAP and hMSCs exerts effects on the regulation of endogenous
glial activities, which may assist tissue repair in the injured spinal
cord.
An increase in galectin-3 expressing microglia by hMSCs
and PACAP
Galectin-3/MAC-2, a member of a class of carbohydrate-
binding proteins, has been known to play a role in tissue repair
following cerebral ischemia [27,28] and mediates microglial
phagocytosis [29,30]. The proteomic analysis showed an increase
in the levels of galectin-3 in the injured spinal cord after the
delayed treatment by hMSCs combined with PACAP (Table S1).
The recent findings have shown the upregulation of galectin-3
expression in microglia located in the hippocampus receiving
hMSCs after transient global ischemia [27]. In our study, galectin-
3-positive cells with amoeboid-like cells were observed at the lesion
center of the spinal cord receiving delayed transplantation with
hMSCs (Figure 6A). Neither galectin-3 nor Iba-1 immunostaining
was colocalized to the transplanted hMSCs with HuNu immuno-
reactivity (Figure 6A, arrowheads). In vitro study using microglia
was performed to examine whether PACAP and hMSCs played
the regulatory role in microglial galectin-3 expression. As shown in
Figure 6B, galectin-3-positive cells without HuNu immunoreac-
tivity were increased in the culture treated with PACAP for
24 hours. The findings were further verified by flow cytometric
assay showing that galectin-3 expressing microglia were signifi-
cantly increased by co-cultured with hMSCs in the presence of
PACAP (Figure 6C and 6D).

medium for 48 hours. The cultured media were collected and applied onto a human growth factors/cytokines antibody array membrane (left panel in

and the staining intensity of each spot was quantified by densitometry. The percentage of the intensity of the respective spots over that of the
positive control (POS) on the same array was represented as the relative expression levels of each human growth factor (B) or cytokine (C). The data
represent mean 6 SEM of three independent experiments.

Glutamate transporter-1 expression in astrocytes treated
with PACAP and hMSCs
Although reactive astrocytes contribute to impairment of axonal
regeneration by the formation of glial scar [31], these cells are
essential in the maintenance of CNS function by providing
metabolic/trophic/antioxidative support and neurotransmitter
homeostasis [32]. Given the fact that the glutamate transporter
activity is modulated along alternation in astrocytic morphology
[33], we examined whether hMSCs and PACAP mediated
astrocytic glutamate uptake activity. At first, Q-PCR was
performed for the analysis of the gene expression of the
astrocyte-specific glutamate transporters, Na+-dependent gluta-
mate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and GLT-1. Our results
revealed that co-culture indirectly with hMSCs in the absence or
presence of PACAP profoundly increased the expression of GLT-1
mRNA in astrocytes when compared to that detected in the
control culture (Figure 7A). However, no significant change in
GLAST mRNA levels was observed after co-culture with hMSCs,
application of PACPA, or both.
Interestingly, we found that the cell surface levels of GLT-1
proteins in astrocytes co-cultured with hMSCs were significantly
increased by the addition of PACAP (Figure 7B). By GLT-1 gene
overexpression approach using lentiviral transduction system, we
further confirmed the upregulation of the cell surface localization
of GLT-1 in astrocytes by co-cultured with hMSCs in the presence
of PACAP. As shown in Figure 7C, diffusible distribution of GLT-
1 or few punctate GLT-1 signal (Figure 7C, arrows) was observed
in astrocytes co-cultured with hMSCs. However, strong punctate
signals were observed in astrocytes transduced with lentiviral
vector encoding GLT-1 after astrcoytes were co-cultured with
hMSCs in the presence of PACAP (Figure 7C, arrowheads).
Moreover, examination of astrocytic glutamate uptake activity
indicated that co-culture with hMSCs and PACAP simultaneously
improved astrocytes to uptake extracellular glutamate when
compared to that observed in the cultures including control,
PACAP treatment, or co-culture only with hMSCs (Figure 7D).
The results reveal that hMSCs in combination with PACAP
increase the membrane levels of GLT-1 which contribute to the
improvement of astrocytic glutamate uptake.
Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated that the immortalized
hMSCs used in this study are able to be differentiated into
neuronal-like cells in vitro under the induction of neurogenic
factors. However, neurons derived from transplanted hMSCs were
not observed in the injured spinal cord. Several studies have
indicated that the trans-differentiation of BMSCs failed to be
observed in vivo [34,35,36]. In addition, the adult mammalian
spinal cord is a non-neurogenic site [37,38]. Thus, it is possible
that the injured spinal cord consists of non-permissive environ-
ment for neuronal trans-differentiation of transplanted hMSCs.
The trophic support of the hMSCs via secreting growth factors
and neurotrophic factors has been well documented [39,40,41].

and reprobed with b-actin antibodies as internal loading control. (D). At day 31 after SCI, rats with severe SCI were subjected onto an open-field to

Similarly, our results from antibody arrays have indicated that
immortalized hMSCs used in this study were found to produce a
high level of angiogenin, EGF, GM-CSF, IGFBP-2/4, and NT-3.
Angiogenin, a potent inducer of revascularization, is known to act
as a neuroprotective molecule for motoneurons [42]. GM-CSF has
been reported to improve functional recovery in rats with SCI via
the inhibition of glial scar formation and apoptosis and increased
expression of immune cells-produced trophic factors [43,44,45]. In
addition, NT-3 is considered as a neurotrophic factor of the
corticospinal tract and is found to promote corticospinal axon
growth and partial functional recovery in rats with mid-thoracic
lesions of dorsal columns or dorsal spinal cord hemisection [46].
EGF combined with FGF-2 has also been found to improve
functional recovery in rats with mild or moderate clip compression
injury at spinal T1 section [47]. Other neuroprotective factors or
growth factors, such as BDNF, BMP-4, and PDGF-BB, were also
detected in the conditioned medium of hMSCs. Although the
expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1a, IL-1b, and
TNFa were detectable, their levels were much lower than those of
IL-6. In addition, hMSCs secreted extremely low levels of MCP-2,
macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1), regulated on
activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES),
thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), stromal
derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and Eotaxin. The role of IL-6 in spinal
cord repair is controversial [48,49,50]. Nevertheless, it is thought
that inflammation plays the beneficial role in spinal cord repair
due to its functions in tissue debris removal and neurotrophic
factors secreted by glial cells [51]. Based on the observations from
our and other laboratories, implanted hMSCs are expected to
provide beneficial niches by secreting those indicated trophic
factors for neural cells to survive and grow in the injured spinal
cord. Indeed, there were a greater number of remaining neuronal
fibers with NF or GAP-43 immunoreactivity in the spinal lesion
center of SCI rats that underwent delayed combinatorial
treatment with PACAP and hMSCs, when compared to that
detected in the vehicle-treated control group.
Peroxiredoxins (Prxs), peroxide-eliminating enzymes ubiqui-
tously expressed in the mammalian cells, consist of six distinct

remaining neuronal fibers in the lesion center of the injured
spinal cord. After BBB open field scores were performed at day 31,
spinal cord tissues were collected. Longitudinal tissue sections were
subjected to immunofluorescence for CGRP (A–D), NF-200 (E–H), or
GAP-43 (I–L). CGRP positive neuronal fibers were observed in the dorsal
section of the spinal cord (D, arrows). Elongated neuronal bundles
labeled with CGRP, NF-200, or GAP-43 (arrows in D, H, and L) were
observed in the injured spinal cord tissue receiving delayed combina-
torial treatment of PACAP and hMSCs. Few NF positive or GAP-43
positive neuronal fibers were seen in the injured spinal cord tissues
treated with PACAP (arrows in F and open arrows in G). Fine NF positive
fibers (arrow in G) or fragmented GAP-43 positive fibers (open arrows in
K) can be detected in the lesion center of the spinal cord with delayed
treatment by hMSCs. Arrowheads indicate the cell debris with

isozymes [52]. The six distinct Prx isozymes are expressed in
different brain regions and different cell types. For instance, Prx1
and 6 are exclusively expressed in glial cells, while Prx2, 3, 4 and 5
are profoundly expressed in neurons [53]. We have found that the
levels of Prx1, Prx6, and MnSOD in the lesion center of the spinal
cord declined along with the longer survival time points, when
compared to that detected in sham-operated control (unpublished
observations of Wang and Tzeng). The findings from our
proteomic analysis and western blotting indicated that increased
levels of Prx1, Prx6, and MnSOD detected in the lesion center of
the spinal cord from the injured rats treated with PACAP and
hMSCs. Perhaps, delayed treatment with PACAP or hMSCs
promoted neural cell survival at the lesion center, causing an
increase in the levels of the three antioxidation/oxidoreduction-
relative proteins at this area. Alternatively, the combinatorial
treatment may upregulate the production of the three antioxida-
tion/oxidoreduction-relative proteins in the cells at the lesion site.
Thus, the combinatorial treatment with PACAP and hMSCs may
provide oxidant defense in the lesion center, which in turn
contribute to the spinal cord tissue repair.
No biostatistical difference in the BBB scores was observed
between rats receiving transplantation of hMSCs and the sham
control group. Yet, the BBB scores of the injured rats with delayed
transplantation of PACAP and hMSCs were significantly increased.
Moreover, a bundle of elongated neuronal fibers remained in the
lesion center of the spinal cord from the injured rats treated with
PACAP and hMSCs. A reduction in astrocytic hypertrophy was also
observed at the lesion center in the animals that received delayed
combinatorial treatment with PACAP and hMSCs. However, the
mechanism for the effect of the combinatorial therapy on the
improvement of spinal cord tissue repair is not sufficiently
understood. Yet, our in vivo observations also demonstrated that
there were galectin-3-positive cells with the morphology of Iba-1
positive microglia/macrophages in the injured spinal cord by
delayed combinatorial treatment with hMSCs and PACAP.
Moreover, we showed that a subpopulation of galectin-3 positive
microglia was upregulated when microglia were co-cultured with
hMSCs in the presence of PACAP. These galectin-3 expressing cells
in the nervous system, including microglia, macrophages, and
Schwann cells, are known to be involved in myelin phagocytosis in
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, ischemia, and axonal
injury [54,55,56,57]. However, microglia/macrophages without
galectin-3 expression do not show effective myelin phagocytosis
[58]. Accordingly, our in vivo and in vitro evidence implicates that
the combinatorial treatment with hMSCs and PACAP may
promote tissue debris clearance by the upregulation of galectin-3-
positive phagocytes in the injured spinal cord.
Glutamate is released at remarkably high concentrations by
excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS. However, extracellular
glutamate overload results in excessive Ca2+ influx into neurons
through overactivation of neuronal ionotropic glutamate receptors,
causing neuronal excitotoxicity. In general, glutamate homeostasis
in the synaptic cleft is maintained by re-uptake of glutamate through
neuronal or glial glutamate transporters [59,60]. However,
Figure 6. Galectin-3 positive microglia increased by combinatorial treatment with PACAP and hMSCs. (A). The injured spinal cord was
collected at day 14 post SCI, which was sectioned and subjected to immunofluorescence staining for galectin-3 (red, arrowhead)/HuNu(green, arrow)
and Iba-1 (red, arrowhead)/HuNu (green, arrow). The tissue sections were then incubated with DAPI for nuclear counterstain. (B). Microglia-hMSC co-
cultures were treated with PACAP (100 nM) for 24 hours, and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining for galectin-3 (green) and HuNu (red).
(C). A representative cytogram of microglia and hMSCs was shown in the left and middle panel, respectively. Accordingly, the cytogram of microglia-
hMSC co-culture indicates two cell populations (right panel): microglia scattering in R1, and hMSCs appearing in R2. (D) Microglia were treated with
PACAP (100 nM), or co-cultured with hMSCs in the absence or presence of PACAP (100 nM). 24 hours later, the relative levels of galectin-3 positive
microglia were determined by FACS. The data represent as the relative level of galectin-3 positive microglia by determining the ratio of galectin-3
positive microglia being analyzed in the region of R1 (C) in comparison with that detected in the control culture. The images shown in B and C were
taken from confocal microscopy. Data consist of means6 SEM of three independent experiments. Scale bar in A, 50 mm; in B, 40 mm. *p,0.05 versus

numerous glutamate-induced CNS neurodegenerative disorders,
such as ischemia and traumatic CNS injury, are associated with
dysfunction of astrocytic glutamate transporters, GLAST and GLT-
1 [61,62]. In our in vitro study, GLT-1 mRNA levels were
upregulated in astrocytes which were co-cultured with hMSCs in
the presence or absence of PACAP. However, the glutamate uptake
ability of astrocytes and GLT-1 protein levels on the cell surface of
astrocytes were significantly increased only by co-culture with
hMSCs in the presence of PACAP. The in vitro evidence suggests
that the administration of hMSCs with PACAP into the injured
spinal cord may increase the cell surface expression of astrocytic
GLT-1 proteins to promote clearance of extracellular glutamate
and reduce SCI-induced neuroexcitotoxicity.
This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of delayed
combinatorial treatment of PACAP and hMSCs for spinal cord
tissue repair in rats with severe SCI. The coordinated effects of
PACAP and hMSCs on the increase of phagocytic microglia
population and astrocytic glutamate uptaking ability may play the
critical role in the promotion of spinal cord tissue repair and
hindlimb recovery in rats with severe SCI.

constructed by the insertion of a 3.45-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment
containing the hTERT cDNA into pIRES2-EGFP [63]. The
hMSC strain (KP) that was developed by transfection with the type
16 human papilloma virus proteins E6E7 as described previously
[23] was further immortalized by nucleoporation with the
pTERT-IRES2-EGFP. Single cell clone (3A6) was selected and
characterized by examining the gene expression of the E6E7,
hTERT and GFP. The cells were then expanded and maintained
in DMEM/low glucose (LG) medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, Utah, USA). For the
induction of neural differentiation, the immortalized hMSCs were
treated with several neurogenic factors in ITS medium that was
prepared as described previously [19].
Primary mixed glia isolated from 1 to 2-day-old Sprague-
Dawley (SD) rat pup cerebral cortices were prepared as described
previously [64]. The cells (107 cells/flask) were then plated onto
poly-D-lysine coated T-75 tissue culture flasks. The medium was
changed every 2 to 3 days. Eight days later, primary rat microglia
were collected using the shake-off method [65]. The remaining
cells in the cultures consisted of 92% to 95% primary rat astrocytes
(as indicated by GFAP positive staining).
Spinal cord injury
Severe SCI was induced using the weight-drop device developed
at New York University [66,67]. The animal surgical procedure was
performed as reported previously [18,24,25]. Briefly, adult female
SD rats (250620 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/
kg). A laminectomy was performed at T9-T10, and the dorsal
surface of the spinal cord was compressed by dropping a 10-gm rod
from a height of 50 mm. During surgery, the rectal temperature was
maintained at 3760.5uC using a thermostatically-regulated heating
pad. Bladder evacuation was applied daily for at least 7 days.
Antibiotics (sodium ampicillin, 80 mg/kg) were daily injected into
animals for 7–9 days. All surgical interventions and animal care
were performed in accordance with the Laboratory Animal Welfare
Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and National
Cheng Kung University.
Cell transplantation
At day 7 after contusive injury, the rats received local injection
with either PACAP (Calbiochem, Germany), or hMSCs, or both.
A 10-ml Exmire microsyringe with a 31-gauge needle was
positioned at the midline of the cords 2 mm rostral and caudal
(dual injection) to the contusive center. Human MSCs (8–106104
cells/injection; approximately 26105 cells/animals) or/and PA-
CAP (1 mg/1 ml/injection; 2 mg/rat) were injected 0.8 mm into
the dorsal column of the spinal cord. Less than 10 ml total volume
of hMSCs and PACAP was used for one injection. Each injection
will be completed within 20 minutes.
BBB locomotor rating scale
The BBB Locomotor Rating Scale was used to evaluate the
hindlimb functional improvement of treated animals with spinal
cord contusion [26]. In this study, the behavioral analysis was
performed at 31 day post SCI before sacrifice.
Tissue section preparation
Experimental animals were perfused intracardially with 0.9%
cold NaCl (400 ml/rat on average), followed by 4% paraformal-
dehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (500 ml/rat). Spinal cord
tissues were removed, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight, and then cryoprotected in 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS
for one day. The cord (approximately 2 cm in length with the
epicenter) was excised, embedded in Tissue Tek OCT (Miles), and
then sectioned longitudinally at the thickness of 20 mm for
immunofluorescence.
Immunofluorescence
Spinal tissue sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) three times, and then incubated for 30 minutes with 0.1%
Triton X-100 in PBS containing 5% horse serum to increase the
permeability and reduce nonspecific binding. Primary antibodies
were applied to tissue sections at the dilution of 1:200 overnight at
4uC in a humidified chamber. Sections were rinsed three times
with PBS followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies for 1 hour
and fluorescein–avidin for 45 minutes at room temperature. For in
vitro study, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes at room temperature. The cells were incubated with
primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5%
horse serum overnight at 4uC, followed by incubation with
biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200; Vector) and FITC-avidin
(1:200; Vector). The antibodies used in this study are listed as
follows: anti-synapsin-1 antibodies (1:200; BD Biosciences, San
Diego, CA), a-internexin (1:200; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-
NF-200 kDa (1:200; NF-200; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), anti-CGRP
(1:200; Chemicon), anti-GAP-43 (1:200; Chemicon), anti-Iba-1
(1:200; Wako Pure Chemical, Japan), anti-GFAP (1:200; Chemi-
con), anti-galectin-3 (1:200; ABcam, Cambridge), or anti-HuNu
(1:200; Chemicon). Nuclear staining was carried out using 49,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution. The immunostained
cells were visualized under fluorescence microscope (Nikon E800)
with a color digital camera or under confocal microscopy.
Human cytokines antibody array
The hMSCs were seeded onto 35-mm petri-dish (46105 cells/
dish) for 48 hours. The conditioned media were collected for the
analysis of trophic factors and cytokines using human cytokine
antibody arrays (Ray Biotech, Inc) under the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the provided blocking buffer was added to
array membranes for 30 minutes. The membranes were then
incubated with 1 ml of conditioned media for 2 hours, followed by
the addition of biotin-conjugated anti-cytokine antibody for
2 hours. The membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated
streptavidin (1: 100) for another 2 hours, and then were analyzed
by chemiluminescence. The membranes were subsequently
exposed to KodakH BioMaxTM light film. The intensities of the
spots on the array membranes were quantified using NIH ImageJ
software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).
Sample preparation for Two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis (2-DE)
The spinal segment (4–5 mm) containing the lesion epicenter
was homogenized in 0.2 ml of cold lysis buffer consisting of
40 mM Tris, 40 mM sodium acetate, 1% NP-40, 1% Triton X-
100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF;
Sigma), and protease inhibitor cocktail in PBS for 30 minutes,
followed by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at
10,000 g for 30 minutes at 4uC to remove insoluble debris. The
proteins were then precipitated by cold acetone with 10%
trichloroacetic acid overnight. After centrifugation, the protein
pellet was washed with cold acetone followed by air drying, and
then resuspended in the rehydration buffer containing 8 M urea,
4% CHAPS, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3/10 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and
50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma). Protein concentration was
assessed using a Bio-Rad reducing agent and detergent compatible
kit (Bio-Rad).

2-DE
For the first-dimension isoelectric focusing (IEF), pH 3–10 non-
linear range immobilized pH gradients (IPG) strips (11 cm) were
rehydrated with 200 ml of solubilized sample (200 mg protein
amount) for 12 hours before the sample was separated by IEF at
100 Volt for 30 minutes, 500 Volt for 30 minutes, 1000 Volt for
1 hour, 5000 Volt for 1 hour, and finally 8000 Volt for 3 h. The
IPG strips were equilibrated with 2 ml of equilibration buffer
consisting of 0.375 M Tris, 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol and
0.02 g/ml DTT at 25uC for 15 minutes followed by equilibration
in 0.375 M Tris, 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol and 0.025 g/
ml iodoacetamide at 25uC for 15 minutes. The second dimension
SDS-PAGE used a 10% separating gel and was then performed
without a stacking gel. The equilibrated IPG gel strip was placed
on top of the SDS-PAGE gel and was sealed with 0.5% low-
melting temperature agarose with 0.01% bromphenol blue as
tracking dye. Electrophoresis was carried out at 180 V until the
tracking dye reached the bottom of the gel. Silver staining was
accessed by immersing the 2-DE gel in the fixation solution
containing methanol (50%), acetic acid (12%), and water (38%) for
30 minutes, followed by 50% ethanol for 60 minutes. The gel was
sensitized by 0.02% sodium thiosulfate solution and stained in a
solution containing 0.2% AgNO3 and 0.05% formaldehyde for 20
minutes, and subsequently developed in a solution of 0.05%
formaldehyde, 2% Na2S2O3, and 0.0004% Na2S2O3. The staining
was stopped at the desired time point by the addition of fixation
solution. The spots on the gels were excised, trypsinized, and
analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-
flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) (autoflex III, Bruker
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).
Western blotting
Spinal tissue blocks (approximately 4–5 mm thickness/block)
were taken from the rostral or caudal regions adjacent to epicenter
or from the contusive site on the spinal cord. Tissue blocks were
homogenized in extraction solution containing 40 mM Tris,
40 mM sodium acetate, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)
using the sonicator. On the other hand, the primary glial cells after
treatment were harvested and gently homogenized on ice using
PBS containing SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetra-
acetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and proteinase
inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentration was assayed using the
Bio-Rad DC kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein extracts (30 mg/
lane) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a
nitrocellulose filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was
probed at 4uC overnight with primary antibodies, and then
incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated second-
ary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA) for 1 hour at room temperature. The detection was
carried out by using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham
Pharmacia, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The primary
antibodies used in this study are listed as follows: anti-Prx-1
(1:1000; Abcam), anti-Prx-6 (1:1000; Abcam), anti-MnSOD
(1:1000; Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), and anti-b-actin
(1:200; Santa Cruz).
Flow cytometry
The assay was used to measure the expression of galectin-3 in
microglia that were seeded on a 35-mm petri-dish at the density of
56105 per dish and co-cultured with hMSCs (46105 cells per
dish). After treatment, the cultures were incubated in cold PBS
containing rabbit anti-galectin3 antibody for 30 minutes at room
temperature, followed by FITC-labeled anti-rabbit antibody
(1:100; Vector Labs) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The
cells were then subjected to FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). Fluorescent intensity was detected in the FL-1
channel (515–545 nm). Data were analyzed using the WinMDI2.8
(The Scripps Research institute, Flow Cytometry Core Facility, La
Jolla, CA). The cytogram of microglia-hMSCs indicated microglia
gated in R1, and hMSCs in R2. Values are presented as relative
level of galectin-3-positive microglia (R1) in each culture to that
detected in the control culture.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR)
The assay was used to measure the mRNA levels of GLT-1 and
GLAST in astrocytes, and the method was followed by the
procedure described previously [68]. PCR amplification of GLT-1
and GLAST was performed for 10 minutes at 95uC, followed by
50 cycles set for 10 seconds at 95uC, annealing for 10 seconds at
65uC for GLT-1 (or at 60uC for GLAST), and extending for 20
seconds at 72uC. The results were normalized to the housekeeping
gene of cyclophilin A (CyPA), and were expressed as a ratio of the
percentage of GLT-1 (or GLAST) to the CyPA control treatment.
Glutamate uptake assay
The experimental procedure was followed as previously
described [68]. Astrocyte cultures were incubated at 37uC for 10
minutes in HHBSS assay buffer (in mM: 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.26
CaCl2, 0.4 MgSO4, 0.64 KH2PO4, 3 NaHCO3, 5.5 glucose, and
20 HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 1 mCi/dish of [3H]-L-glutamate
(Amershan Biosciences) plus 100 mM of unlabeled L-glutamate.
The reaction was terminated by aspiration of the assay buffer. The
radioactivity of aliquots (350 ml) in 3 ml of liquid scintillation
counting solution was measured by a Liquid Scintillation Counter.
In parallel, 10-ml aliquots were taken to measure the protein
content using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. The radioactivity
after normalization to the protein content in the cultures was
referred as glutamate uptake activity. The relative uptake activity
was represented as the percentage of the uptake activity of the
treated culture over the control group.
Preparation of glutamate transporter-1 expressing vector
and lentiviral vector transduction
According to cDNA sequences of rat GLT-1 (NM-017215) in
Genbank, the primers (sense: 59- GCCATGGCATCAACC-
GAGGGT-39; GLT-1 anti-sense: 59-TTTTTCACGTTTC-
CAAGGTTCT-39) of full length GLT-1 was designed. Total
RNA was isolated from adult SD rat cortical tissues, and then
subjected to RT-PCR using GLT-1 primers with 35-cycle reaction
at 94uC for 30 seconds, 62uC for 30 seconds, and 72uC for 1
minute 30 seconds. GLT-1 cDNA product (a 1721-bp fragment;
+109 to +1830) was cloned into TA cloning vector (TOPO II,
Invitrogen). The orientation of the cDNA inserts was verified by
autosequencing. The cDNA inserts were cut out using BamHI and
XhoI and subcloned into pLV-CAG-GLT-1-GFP lentiviral vector
(lenti-GLT-1-GFP). The lentiviral vectors expressing GLT-GFP
were constructed and the lentivirus particles were prepared by
Biosettia, Inc (San Diego, CA, USA). Astrocytes (46105 cells/well)
were replated onto 12-mm coverslips placed in a 24-well plate for
2–3 days, and then were transduced by the appropriate amount
(150 ml virus particles) of lenti-GLT-1-GFP transduction particles
with DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% calf serum (Hyclone).
Twenty-four hours after the transduction, the culture medium was
replaced with fresh DMFM/F-12 medium containing 10% CS,
and the cell cultures were incubated for another 48 hours. Infected
astrocytes were then co-cultured indirectly with hMSCs. The
hMSCs (56104 cells per well) were seeded onto the Transwells

with Millicell-CM filters (12 mm in diameter; pore size 0.4 mm) for
24 hours before co-culture was performed. After 72 hours, the
cultures were washed with PBS for three times, followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Analysis of cell surface levels of glutamate transporter-1
Primary astrocytes were cultured at the density of 46105 cells
per 35 mm petri dish and indirectly co-incubated with hMSCs
(56105 cells per filter) that were plated onto the Transwells with
Millicell-CM filters (30 mm in diameter) with 0.4-mm pores for
24 hours. After treatment by PACAP for 48 hours, membrane
proteins were extracted using ProteoJETTM membrane protein
extraction kit, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Fermen-
tas, EU). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad
DC kit (Hercules, CA). Fifty micrograms of membrane proteins
were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. The protein was identified by incubating
the membrane with anti-GLT-1 antibody (1:1000; Millipore) or
anti- purinergic P2X7R antibody (1:1000; Alomone Labs, Israel)
overnight at 4uC, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (1:2000) and ECL solution.
Statistical Analysis
The results are presented as mean 6 SEM. The two tailed
Mann-Whitney test and repeated measures analysis of variance
were performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the results
(p value ,0.05).
