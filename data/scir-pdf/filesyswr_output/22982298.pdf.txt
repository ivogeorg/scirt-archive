spinal cord. Among the 20 brain regions, there were brain nuclei
with a high axonal regenerative capacity, such as the nucleus of
the medial longitudinal fasciculus (NMLF) and the intermediate
reticular formation (IMRF). In these brain nuclei, 32–51% of the
neurons regenerate their axons into the spinal cord. In brain nuclei

1. Introduction
In general, mammalian central neurons cannot repair after
nerve injury, whereas fish central neurons can regrow their axons
and restore function even after nerve transection. In the rat model
of spinal cord lesion, primary cortical motor neurons and motor
recover motor function 6–8 weeks after SCI (Van Raamsdonk
et al., 1998; Becker et al., 2004). Similar to mammals, motor func-
tion in zebrafish is controlled by motor neurons from two distinct
populations, the brainstem and the spinal cord. Recently, it was re-
ported that motor neurons in the spinal cord are newly-generated
from progenitor cells located around the central canal after SCIReceived in revised form 21 August 2012

Unlike mammals, fish motor function can recover within 6–8 weeks after spinal cord injury (SCI). The
motor function of zebrafish is regulated by dual control; the upper motor neurons of the brainstem
and motor neurons of the spinal cord. In this study, we aimed to investigate the framework behind the
regeneration of upper motor neurons in adult zebrafish after SCI. In particular, we investigated the cell
survival of axotomized upper motor neurons and its molecular machinery in zebrafish brain. As represen-
tative nuclei of upper motor neurons, we retrogradely labeled neurons in the nucleus of medial longitu-
dinal fasciculus (NMLF) and the intermediate reticular formation (IMRF) using a tracer injected into the
lesion site of the spinal cord. Four to eight neurons in each thin sections of the area of NMLF and IMRF
were successfully traced at least 1–15 days after SCI. TUNEL staining and BrdU labeling assay revealed
that there was no apoptosis or cell proliferation in the axotomized neurons of the brainstem at various
time points after SCI. In contrast, axotomized neurons labeled with a neurotracer showed increased
expression of anti-apoptotic factors, such as Bcl-2 and phospho-Akt (p-Akt), at 1–6 days after SCI. Such
a rapid increase of Bcl-2 and p-Akt protein levels after SCI was quantitatively confirmed by western blot
analysis. These data strongly indicate that upper motor neurons in the NMLF and IMRF can survive and
regrow their axons into the spinal cord through the rapid activation of anti-apoptotic molecules after SCI.
The regrowing axons from upper motor neurons reached the lesion site at 10–15 days and then crossed ataDivision of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, 5-11-80 Kodatsuno, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-0942, Japan

tions at 121 C for 20 min in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for Bcl-2,
nter2.3. Tissue preparation
At appropriate time points, the brain and the spinal cord were
exposed under deep anesthesia (0.1% MS222 in PBS) and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, overnight at 4 C. They were then
incubated in an ascending series of sucrose concentrations from
5% to 20%, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT)
compound (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan). Subsequently, cryosec-
tions were prepared at 12 or 20 lm thickness. The coronal sections
were used for all experiments of the brainstem and the longitudi-
nal sections were used for experiments of the spinal cord. To deter-
mine the anatomical structure of the adult zebrafish brainstem, we
referred to the zebrafish brain atlas (Wullimann et al., 1996).
2.4. Retrograde tracing
To label brainstem neurons projecting into the spinal cord,
retrograde tracing from the lesion site of the spinal cord was per-
formed as described previously (Becker et al., 1997). In brief, a
small piece of gelatin foam (Spongel; Astellas, Tokyo, Japan) soakedneurons regenerate their spinal axons (Becker et al., 1997). They
also reported that zebrafish brainstem neurons, which were retro-
gradely double-labeled by tracers, could be observed 6 weeks after
SCI. These data indicate that upper motor neurons in the brainstem
can survive for a long time and then regrow their axons to the
spinal cord after SCI. However, there are three questions that
should be solved in more detail: (1) Are the regenerating axons de-
rived only from originally axotomized and survived neurons or in
part from newly-generated neurons? (2) Do the cell apoptosis
and/or cell proliferation in the brainstem occur during the axonal
regeneration process? (3) What kind of molecule is responsible
for cell survival of upper motor neurons after SCI? In the present
study, therefore, we focused on these specific questions, especially
on elucidating the molecular machinery for cell survival of upper
motor neurons following SCI. To answer these questions, we con-
ducted terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay, 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU)
labeling and immunohistochemical staining of anti-apoptotic fac-
tors (Bcl-2 and phospho-Akt) in combination with retrograde trac-
ing technique in adult zebrafish after SCI.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio; 3–4 cm in body length) were used
throughout this study. The experiments were performed in accor-
dance with the Committee on Animal Experimentation of the
Kanazawa University, and all attention was paid to minimize pain
and the numbers of fish used.
2.2. Spinal cord injury
As described previously (Reimer et al., 2009), fish were anesthe-
tized by immersion in 0.033% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulf-
onic acid (MS222; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 0.01 M
phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), and the spinal cord was
transected 4 mm caudal to the brainstem-spinal cord junction, un-
less otherwise specified. After surgery, the incision was sealed with
histoacryl (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) and the
fish were reared in 26 C water until appropriate time points.
K. Ogai et al. / Neurochemistry Iwith 25 mg/ml biocytin (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or
50 mg/ml rhodamine dextran amine (RDA, Fluororuby; Fluoro-
chrome, Denver, CO, USA) was applied to the transected spinalp-Akt and GAP43 immunohistochemistry, or incubating sections
with 2 M HCl at 37 C for 30 min for BrdU immunohistochemistry.
Sections were then washed, blocked and incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4 C. After washing, sections were incu-
bated with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary
antibodies at 23 C for 1 h, followed by washing and nuclear stain-
ing with 2 lg/ml DAPI. The sections were then observed by fluores-tions were cleared in xylene and mounted with MGK-S (Matsun-
ami Glass, Osaka, Japan). The sections were then observed by
bright field microscopy (VB-7000).
2.8. Immunohistochemistry
Primary antibodies used were as follows; mouse anti-BrdU
(Sigma–Aldrich; 1:500), rabbit anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; 1:300), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (p-Akt;
pSer473) (Sigma–Aldrich; 1:500) andmouse anti-GAP43 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; 1:300). Immunohistochemistry was performed as
described previously (Matsukawa et al., 2004; Nagashima et al.,
2009). In brief, antigen retrieval was performed by autoclaving sec-2.7. Hematoxylin–eosin staining
Hematoxylin–eosin staining was carried out to show the struc-
ture of lesioned spinal cord as follows. Sections were stained with
Mayer’s hematoxylin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) for 3 min
followed by washing and counter-staining with 1% eosin-Y (Wako
Pure Chemical Industries) for 10 min. After dehydration in ansitive cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. For the
positive control, 100 U/ml DNase I (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) was
applied to the sections prior to TUNEL staining.
2.6. Intraperitoneal application of BrdU
BrdU incorporation assay was performed to visualize cell prolif-
eration, as described previously (Reimer et al., 2008). In brief, fish
were anesthetized and intraperitoneally injected with 50 ll of
2.5 mg/ml BrdU (Sigma–Aldrich) at 0, 2 and 4 days post-lesion
(dpl). Cells incorporating BrdU were visualized by immunohisto-cord. The tracer was allowed to be transported to the brainstem
neurons for at least 1 day (biocytin), or 3–6 days (RDA). Biocytin
was detected with DyLight 594-conjugated NeutrAvidin (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) along with the appropriate second-
ary antibody for immunohistochemistry (see Section 2.8). RDA was
directly detected by fluorescence microscopy (VB-7000; Keyence,
Osaka, Japan).
2.5. TUNEL assay
Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL technology using In Situ
Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. In brief, sections were microwaved in 0.01 M citrate buffer,
washed, blocked and incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase and fluorescein-conjugated dUTP at 37 C overnight,
followed by counter-staining with 2 lg/ml 40,6-diamidino-2-phen-

color-overlaid using Photoshop CS5 software (Adobe Systems, San
Jose, CA, USA).
At 6 weeks post-lesion, the spinal cord was transected 4 mm
nter2.9. Western blot analysis
At appropriate time-points, the brains minus the telencephalon
and the optic tectum, where the projections to the spinal cord
were absent (Becker et al., 1997), were extracted and sonicated
in 100 ll lysis buffer (10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-
ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton
X-100, 50 mM sodium fluoride and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate:
purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries or Nacalai Tesque,
Kyoto, Japan). The supernatants were collected and the protein
concentration was measured using the Bradford method (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Thirty micrograms of total protein was
loaded in each lane of a 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacryl-
amide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (What-
man, Maidstone, UK). The membrane was cut at the 47 kDa
protein marker (Nacalai Tesque) and separated into two parts to
probe for Bcl-2 (1:500, 26 kDa) and p-Akt (1:500, 56 kDa). Primary
antibodies used were the same as those used in the immunohisto-
chemistry (see Section 2.8). After washing and incubation with
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma), the
signals were visualized by BCIP/NBT Phosphatase Substrate System
(KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Densitometrical analysis was per-
formed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA).
2.10. Cell counting
The number of Bcl-2- or p-Akt-immunoreactive cells in the
NMLF and IMRF was counted after immunohistochemistry (see
Section 2.8) using serial brain sections in which the whole region
of the NMLF and IMRF was included. We used 20 lm-thick sections
to minimize double-counting due to the cell splitting, because the
cell diameter of upper motor neurons was not much larger than
20 lm (Becker et al., 1997). In addition, the cells without DAPI sig-
nal (i.e., counterpart of the split cell) were excluded from the
counting. The anatomical position was determined by the same
procedure as in Section 2.3. For counting, at least 3 animals in each
group were recruited. After counting the cells, means and SEMs
were calculated on all animals (nP 3).
2.11. Behavioral analysis
To quantify the restoration of motor function, behavioral analy-
sis was performed with a slight modification of previously
described method (Kato et al., 1996, 2004; Kaneda et al., 2008).
In brief, a single zebrafish was placed in a water tank
(370  240 mm, water depth = 80 mm) and its spontaneous move-
ment was captured by two video cameras (EVI-1011; Sony, Tokyo,
Japan) placed both on the top and at the side of the tank for 5 min
at 30 frames/s. The position of the fish in each frame was deter-
mined, and the three-dimensional coordination of the fish was
then reconstructed by combining two images (from the top and
side view) with previously developed software (Kato et al., 1996,
2004; Kaneda et al., 2008) on a computer (Precision 490; Dell,
Round Rock, TX, USA). The total distance of swimming was calcu-
lated as described in Kato et al. (1996). At least 3 fish were re-
cruited for each time point after SCI.
2.12. Statistical analysis
The levels of Bcl-2 or p-Akt protein in brainstem neurons at var-
ious time points after SCI were quantified densitometrically and
expressed as a ratio compared with an unlesioned fish. The number
1204 K. Ogai et al. / Neurochemistry Iof Bcl-2- and p-Akt-positive cells was expressed as the mean-

3. Results
3.1. Stability of neurotracers in brainstem neurons after SCI
In this study, we transected the spinal cord of zebrafish 4 mm
caudal to brainstem-spinal cord junction, unless otherwise speci-
fied. Retrograde labeling of the NMLF and IMRF nuclei in the brain-
stem was performed by placing gelatin foam soaked with
rhodamine dextran amine (RDA) or biocytin at the transection site
in the spinal cord (Becker et al., 2004). In the area of NMLF (Fig. 1A),
approximately 10 RDA-labeled neurons were seen at 1 day post-le-
sion (dpl). The intense signal of RDA was sustained for at least 3–
6 dpl (Fig. 1B–D). In the area of IMRF (Fig. 1E), similar stable label-
ing of RDA could be seen in 1–6 dpl (Fig. 1F–H). In both areas, ret-
rogradely labeled neurons were detected even at 15 dpl (data not
shown). In contrast, retrograde labeling with biocytin was a
slightly more labile. Stable labeling with biocytin could be seen
only to 3 dpl in the NMLF and IMRF (data not shown). Therefore,
we used RDA for long-term experiments over 6 dpl and biocytin
for short-term experiments up to 3 dpl. The long-term presence
of neurons in the NMLF and IMRF labeled by the retrograde tracer
strongly indicates that these neurons survive after SCI.
3.2. Absence of apoptosis in axotomized brainstem neurons following
SCI
To further elucidate the survival of brainstem neurons after SCI,
we conducted TUNEL assay in NMLF and IMRF neurons identified
by retrograde labeling with RDA at 6 dpl. In these neurons, there
were no double positive neurons with TUNEL-positive (TUNEL+)
and tracer+ at 6 dpl (Fig. 2). The positive control treated with DNase
I yielded clearly positive cells (data not shown). Thus, axotomized
neurons in the NMLF and IMRF could avoid undergoing apoptosis
at least 6 days after SCI.
3.3. Absence of cell proliferation in the brainstem following SCI
In axonal regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS),
there are two possibilities for the cellular origin of regenerating ax-
ons after nerve injury. They can either be derived from newly-gen-
erated neurons or the neurons themselves could have survived
after nerve injury. To determine which cell types are present in
the brainstem of adult zebrafish during axonal regeneration after
SCI, we performed a BrdU incorporation assay. BrdU was intraper-
itoneally injected at 0, 2 and 4 dpl (Fig. 3A and H). To confirm suc-
cessful incorporation of BrdU, we chose the paraventricular zone in
the telencephalon as a positive control, as many neural precursor
cells are present even in the adult zebrafish (Kizil et al., 2012).
BrdU+ cells could be detected in this region at 7 dpl (Fig. 3B and
C) and at 6 weeks post-lesion (Fig. 3J and K). However, no BrdU+
neurons were seen both in the NMLF (Fig. 3D and E) and IMRF
(Fig. 3F and G) at 7 dpl.

of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and phospho-Akt (p-Akt) in the
total protein extracts from the brainstem, including the NMLF and

To evaluate the recovery of motor function in zebrafish after
SCI, we measured moving behavior in a three-dimensional fashion
with a computer image processing system (Kato et al., 1996, 2004;

4. Discussion
4.1. Long-term survival of upper motor neurons in the NMLF and IMRF
of the adult zebrafish brainstem after SCI
Adult zebrafish are able to regenerate various tissues, including
the CNS. In CNS regeneration, there are two cell sources of
regenerating axons after injury. One is neurons differentiated from
multipotent precursor cells, the other is the surviving neurons
post-injury. In the present study using adult zebrafish, upper

(A-2). (A-1) In unlesioned spinal cord, there were no GAP43+ fibers. At 15 dpl, a few GAP

rotracer showed the upregulation of survival signaling for a long
time after SCI. The survival of axotomized neurons was further
confirmed by the absence of cell apoptosis and cell proliferation
at any time after SCI (Figs. 2 and 3). Our data were in good agree-
ment with previous findings in the adult zebrafish brain, reporting
that the number of newly-generated neurons is extremely low in
the region where descending neurons exist (Zupanc et al., 2005;
Hinsch and Zupanc, 2007). In contrast to the upper motor neurons
in the brainstem, motor neurons in the spinal cord become apopto-
tic after SCI, and neurogenesis from the ependymal zone around
the central canal is activated via sonic hedgehog and/or Notch
signaling (Reimer et al., 2008, 2009; Dias et al., 2012).
In adult zebrafish retina, we have reported that the optic nerve
can be regenerated, even after optic nerve transection, and visual
function can be almost fully recovered within 90–100 days after

nteraxotomy (Kato et al., 2007; Kaneda et al., 2008). Similar to these
studies, we have investigated the regenerative capacity of retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) after axotomy in the adult zebrafish, by com-
paring with the rat retina which cannot be regenerated. We have
shown that there are no TUNEL+ RGCs in the fish retina for at least
20 days after axotomy, whereas many TUNEL+ RGCs were observed
in the rat retina at 6 days after optic nerve crush (Koriyama et al.,
2007; Homma et al., 2007). Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic factors
Bcl-2 and p-Akt are upregulated in the fish retina 2–5 days after
axotomy, whereas these anti-apoptotic proteins are rapidly down-
regulated in the rat retina after nerve crush. The upregulation of
Bcl-2 and p-Akt in the fish retina is mediated by the activation of
the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway through
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (Koriyama et al., 2007; Jantas
et al., 2009). In this study, we found that the levels of Bcl-2 and

1210 K. Ogai et al. / Neurochemistry Ip-Akt increased rapidly in the brainstem approximately 2-fold be-
tween 1–6 days after SCI in adult zebrafish (Figs. 4 and 5), which
was consistent with the increase in the number of Bcl-2- or p-
Akt-positive cells in the NMLF and IMRF at 3 dpl compared with
the unlesioned brainstem. And the increased expression of these
anti-apoptotic factors was detected in retrogradely labeled neu-
rons in the NMLF and IMRF. From these findings, it is suggested
that axotomized neurons in the brainstem of adult zebrafish can
survive after SCI through the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic
factors, Bcl-2 and p-Akt. This is a new and convincing explanation
for the survival of upper motor neurons following SCI in adult
zebrafish.
4.2. Long distance regeneration of descending axons from upper motor
neurons of the brainstem after SCI in adult zebrafish
In this study, we showed that long-distance regenerating axons
descended beyond the lesion site of the spinal cord after SCI in
adult zebrafish by three distinct methods. The first method is the
double lesion test with a retrograde labeling: In this experiment,
the fish received a primary lesion 4 mm caudal to the brainstem-
spinal cord junction, and received a second lesion 4 mm caudal
to the primary lesion site, to inject the retrograde tracer at 6 weeks
after the initial lesion (Fig. 3H and I). A number of neurons in the
NMLF and IMRF were labeled with a tracer injected at the second
lesion site (Fig. 3M and P; Becker et al., 1997). The second method
was more direct: we used histology of longitudinal sections of thespinal cord to show that thin fibers connected the lesion site be-
tween 30–60 days after SCI (Fig. 6). In these longitudinal sections,
we could see that there was an increase in the number of GAP43+
axons in proportion to days after SCI. The third method used was to
measure swimming behavior of zebrafish following SCI: Swimming
behavior was measured three-dimensionally using a computer im-
age processing system, which revealed that the temporal pattern of
recovery of motor function is biphasic, with a slow recovery rate
observed for first 2 weeks and a relatively fast recovery rate ob-
served from 3–8 weeks after SCI (Fig. 7F). The turning point of
these slow and fast phases is around 2 weeks after SCI, which cor-
responds well to the time taken for regenerating axons to reach the
lesion site (Fig. 6). This three-dimensional behavior analysis re-
vealed the recovery of motor function after SCI in more detail as
compared to the previous study in which the two-dimensional
eous swimming of the fish was traced for 5 min, and total swimming distance was
sh can swim unrestrictedly (A). However, the swimming capability was significantly
erved. At 53 dpl (E), there was a steep recovery in the distance swam to about 54% of
ming distance after SCI. Values in (F) are expressed as the means ± SEM. ⁄p < 0.05,

national 61 (2012) 1202–1211tracking of fish was used (Becker et al., 2004). The biphasic pattern
of behavioral recovery may be due to the increase in the number of
GAP43+ descending axons. Becker et al. (2005) further demon-
strated that not only axotomized upper motor neurons but also
intraspinal neurons upregulate GAP43 in response to SCI. At pres-
ent, therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of
GAP43+ axons shown in Fig. 6 are confused with regenerating
intraspinal axons. However, as mentioned above, upper motor neu-
rons could be retrogradely labeled from more caudal part to the le-
sion site at 6 weeks after SCI (Fig. 3M and P). Moreover, the
swimming behavior was recovered in accordance with the increase
of GAP43+ axons in caudal part to the lesion site (Fig. 7). From these
findings, it is certain that upper motor neurons can regenerate
their axons across the lesion site following SCI. In spinal cord
regeneration of adult zebrafish, it is known that motor neurons
have regenerative capacity, but sensory neurons (e.g., dorsal root
ganglia) do not (Becker et al., 2005). It needs to be elucidated
whether descending or ascending axons are present in the ‘‘bridge’’
connecting the proximal and distal segments in the vicinity of the
lesion site. Furthermore, the exact molecular mechanism behind
the axonal regeneration of brainstem neurons after SCI remains
to be determined.
In optic nerve regeneration, we previously identified a variety of
regeneration-associated genes and pathways involved in axonal
elongation, such as retinoic acid signaling, retinal transglutamin-
ase, and nitric oxide synthetase/NO signaling (Matsukawa et al.,
2004; Sugitani et al., 2006, 2012; Koriyama et al., 2009; Nagashima
et al., 2009). The next goal is to determine such regeneration-
associated genes enabling upper motor neurons to regenerate their
axons.
