Glial scarring following severe tissue damage and inflammation after spinal cord injury (SCi) is due to an 
extreme, uncontrolled form of reactive astrogliosis that typically occurs around the injury site. The scarring 
process includes the misalignment of activated astrocytes and the deposition of inhibitory chondroitin sulfate 
proteoglycans. Here, we first discuss recent developments in the molecular and cellular features of glial 
scar formation, with special focus on the potential cellular origin of scar-forming cells and the molecular 
mechanisms underlying glial scar formation after SCi. Second, we discuss the role of glial scar formation in the 
regulation of axonal regeneration and the cascades of neuro-inflammation. Last, we summarize the physical 
and pharmacological approaches targeting the modulation of glial scarring to better understand the role of glial 
scar formation in the repair of SCi.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCi) is a common and devastating 
central nervous system (CNS) insult that results in 
disruption of cord microstructure and is followed by limited 
neuronal regeneration and insufficient functional recovery 
in adult mammals. After severe SCi, and in response 
to changes in the local microenvironment, astrocytes, 
the most abundant glial cells in the CNS, transform into 
reactive astrocytes and undergo dramatic morphological 
changes[1] as wel l  as massive var iat ions in gene 
expression[2]. Reactive astrocytes, the major component 
of glial scars, along with other cells in the spinal cord and 
blood-borne cells leaking from the damaged blood-spinal 
cord barrier, participate in the process of scar formation[3]. 
From the historical perspective, a glial scar is recognized 
as an impediment to the regeneration of axons in the cord 
because of the irregular rearrangement of hypertrophic 
astrocytic processes, as well as major components of 
the axonal inhibitory extracellular matrix (ECM), including 
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that are 
secreted by the reactive astrocytes[4]. Currently, increasing 
evidence is advancing our knowledge of the mechanism 
of the formation of glial scars after a lesion and the roles 
of glial scars in the regulation of neuro-inflammation and 
repair processes[5,6].
This article reviews the following: (1) the molecular 
and cellular properties of glial scar formation following SCi; 
(2) the roles of glial scar formation in axonal regeneration 
and neuro-inflammation; and (3) the current status of scar-
modulating therapeutic strategies for spinal cord repair after 
injury.
Molecular and Cellular Properties of Glial Scars
Characterization of Glial Scars
Traumatic damage of the spinal cord can result in seal-
like scar tissue in the lesion zone, which is filled with dense 
cellular components and a connective matrix. Generally, 
the scar tissue is classified into two parts, fibrotic and glial. 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 421–435422
The fibrotic scar, primarily composed of invading fibroblasts 
derived from perivascular and meningeal cells, occupies 
the epicenter of the lesion area, with sedimentation of 
collagen matrix[7]. Close to the outer layer of the fibrotic 
scar, a specialized structure is found, the glial limiting 
membrane, which marks the interface between the 
fibrotic scar and glial scar tissue[8]. The glial scar (mainly 
astrocytic) evolves from the dynamic process of reactive 
gliosis, which is characterized by complicated and mesh-
like processes extended by reactive astrocytes converging 
on the peri-lesion zone, thus building a physical barrier to 
axonal growth after SCi. it is noteworthy that the glial scar 
has a spatial orientation. Magnetic resonance imaging has 
revealed that the mean thickness of the glial scar rostral/
caudal to the cavity is thicker than that in the region lateral 
to the cavity formed in rat spinal cord[9].
Another important feature of the glial scar is the 
increased expression of ECM components, which are 
predominantly secreted by reactive astrocytes. Among 
the ECM components, the CSPGs and the nature of their 
inhibition of axonal regeneration and restriction of plasticity 
have been studied extensively[10-12]. After injury to the rat 
spinal cord, there is increasing expression of members of 
the CSPG family, including neurocan, versican, brevican 
and NG2[13,14]. in humans, after SCi, the CSPG family 
members NG2 and phosphacan are both detectable in the 
evolving astroglial scar, while neurocan and versican exist 
exclusively in the lesion epicenter[15]. Mediated by Rho 
kinase, CSPGs inhibit neurite growth in vitro and in vivo[16]. 
Recently, Siebert and osterhout found that CSPGs directly 
suppress the process outgrowth from oligodendrocyte 
progenitor cells (oPCs) and their differentiation into mature 
oligodendrocytes in vitro[17]. interestingly, CSPGs also 
control the activity of resident microglia and infiltrating 
blood-borne monocytes via the CD44 receptor, thus playing 
a beneficial role in the acute phase of SCI[18].
in general, the formation of the glial scar depends on 
the severity of the lesion, as severe trauma can give rise 
to a permanent glial scar in the affected region. in addition, 
the disparity of astrocytic location within the spinal cord can 
also influence the development of glial scars. Astrocytes 
proximal to the lesion site densely overlap newly-
proliferated astrocytes and those that have migrated from 
distal areas, and undergo isomorphic gliosis, leading to an 
established glial scar, while reactive astrocytes far from the 
site of injury eventually reacquire a quiescent state with 
normal morphological and functional features[19]. Therefore, 
the highly heterogeneous state of astrocytes that have 
been altered to respond to the specific injury appears to be 
a critical determinant of glial scar formation[20].
Cellular Origin of Glial Scars
Glial scar formation after SCi is generally referred to as 
reactive astrogliosis. Most reactive astrocytes in a glial scar 
have two origins: those proximal to the lesion zone that 
experience dramatic up-regulation of cytoskeletal proteins 
[such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin and 
nestin], and those that acquire stem-cell properties to form 
new astrocytic progeny[21]. The other source is astrocytes 
that have migrated from a distal area to the lesion site[22]. in 
addition to the astrocytic origin of the astrocytes localized 
in the spinal cord[23], glial scar formation also involves the 
activation of cells including ependymal cells, NG2-positive 
cells, and meningeal cells surrounding the lesion site[24–26]. 
More importantly, several studies have shown that the 
various aforementioned cells, which are able to change 
their phenotypes, are eventually fated to become reactive 
astrocytes and are located in the glial scar[25,27,28].
in the adult rodent spinal cord, stem/progenitor cells 
exist at two main locations: the zone proximal to the central 
canal and the outer circumference below the pial surface of 
the cord[29]. Via genetic fate mapping, ependymal cells have 
been identified as the dominant proliferating cell population 
that act as neural stem cells and give rise to new cells in 
the intact adult spinal cord[30] (Fig. 1).
in response to SCi, ependymal cells lining the central 
canal are induced to generate migratory progeny that 
differentiate into astrocytes and participate in glial scar 
formation[31]. Most ependymal cell-derived astrocytes 
are GFAP-negative but express other markers and have 
ultrastructural characteristics of astrocytes. The ependymal 
cell-derived astrocytes form the core of the glial scar, and 
the astrocytes at the periphery arise by self-duplication[26].
NG2, a membrane-spanning CSPG, is not only 
expressed in a population of fate-restricted oPCs but 
also exists on many cellular surfaces after damage to the 
spinal cord[32]. Previous work has provided evidence that 
the NG2+ cell population includes oPCs[33], pericytes[34], 
non-myelinating Schwann cells[35], meningeal cells[36], 
Yi-Min Yuan, et al.    The glial scar in SCi and repair 423
macrophages[37] and microgl ia [38],  suggest ive of a 
heterogeneous cell population within the injured spinal 
cord. Sellers and colleagues have demonstrated that NG2 
progenitors have a diverse differentiation profile, producing 
oligodendrocytes, expressing myelin basic protein in 
processes that wrap axons 7 days after injury, and 
differentiating into scar-forming astrocytes during 24 h post-
lesion[28]. Evidence has also been presented that nestin- 
and double cortin-positive meningeal cells may be a new 
source of multipotential adult stem/precursor cells in the 
spinal cord parenchyma, and these cells can differentiate 
and migrate to participate in glial scar formation[27]. in 
addition, Nestin+ and Nkx6.1+ vascular muscle cells[39], 
which are characteristic of mineralization, can give rise to 
scar-forming stromal cells, but their interaction with glial 
scar-forming astrocytes is not fully established. Further 
studies are required to clarify the features and the fate 
of NG2+ infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia 
around the scar[40,41].
Mechanisms of Glial Scar Formation 
Considerable research on the signaling pathways and 
molecular mediators involved in the triggering and 
modulation of reactive astrocytes has advanced our 
understanding of the important role of reactive astrogliosis 
Fig. 1. Schematic of the cellular origin of glial scar formation following spinal cord injury (SCI). Astrocytes (blue), ependymal cells 
(rose) and NG2+ progenitor cells (green) can give rise to a heterogeneous scar-forming astrocyte population within the glial scar 
established after SCI.

in CNS injury. However, the molecular mechanisms 
underlying glial scar formation after SCi have not been fully 
elucidated. Here, we briefly summarize some molecules 
associated with the initiation and maintenance of the glial 
scar in different animal models of SCi (Table 1).
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)  Traumatic injury 
to the spinal cord results in the up-regulation of BMPs 
2/4/7 and noggin in reactive astrocytes at the lesion 
site[42]. Neurosphere cultures from the cord of the adult 
mouse show that BMP-4 promotes astrocyte differentiation 
from NSCs while suppressing the production of neurons 
and oligodendrocytes[43]. Moreover, genetic ablation of 
BMPR1b, a subtype of the type 1 BMP receptor, leads to 
an attenuated glial scar in the chronic stages following 
compression injury, indicative of a vital role in glial scar 
progression[44]. interestingly, BMPR1a and BMPR1b 
signaling have opposite effects on the early beneficial 
phases of astrocytic hypertrophy, while an apparent 
disruption of reactive astrocytic gliosis at the acute stage 
following SCi occurs in BMPR1a conditional knockout 
animals. Collectively, these findings reveal that BMPs are 
deeply involved in the initial establishment and progressive 
maintenance of glial scar formation. 
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)  MMP-2 and MMP-9, 
members of the MMP family implicated in ECM remodeling, 
are spatially and temporally correlated with glial scar 
formation[45]. By using specific gene-deficient mice, MMP-2 
and MMP-9 have been demonstrated to play a synergistic 
role in glial scar formation. An overt role of limiting 
extensive glial scarring has been found in the MMP-2-null 
mouse[46], while MMP-9 is instrumental in the development 
of an inhibitory glial scar by increasing the migration 
of reactive astrocytes surrounding the lesion site[47]. 
Furthermore, infusion of a recombinant extracellular MMP 
inducer adenovirus into the contused animal spinal cord, 
and, consequently, increasing the secretion of MMP-3, 
reduces CSPG deposition in the glial scar and improves 
locomotor recovery[48].
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  EGFR, 
which is undetectable in astrocytes in normal adult CNS, 
is upregulated in astrocytes after contusive damage to 
the spinal cord[49]. Further study has demonstrated that 
EGFR induces reactive astrocytes to migrate, undergo 
hypertrophy, and form a glial scar through activation of 
the Rheb–mToR signal pathway[50]. Deprivation of EGFR 
activity in mice results in malformed glial borders and larger 
lesions after SCi[51]. in addition, EGFR ligands, such as 
EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), 
stimulate astrocytes to secrete CSPGs to further form the 
glial scar[52]. EGFR also favors the activation of microglia 
via the phosphorylation of MAPK and downstream 
mediators[53]. Hence, EGFR at the lesion area is a critical 
player responsible for glial scar formation during the acute 
stage after SCi. 
Eph/Ephrins  The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases 
is well known for its role in guiding axonal growth during 
development. After damage to the adult spinal cord, 
members of the Eph family, along with their ligands 
(ephrins), accumulate in the proximal axon stump and 
reactive astrocytes and are thus implicated in glial scar 
formation[54]. The studies of the effects of ephrin-B2 on 
reactive astrocytes and EphB2 on meningeal fibroblasts 
demonstrate that cellular interplay mediated by ephrin-B2 
and EphB2 is an early event that results in the development 
of a glial scar in the injured spinal cord[55]. in addition, 
the up-regulation of EphA4 in injured axons leads to the 
retraction of corticospinal axons and inhibition of axon 
regeneration in the weeks after a spinal lesion[56]. Notably, a 
study by Turnley’s team showed that astrocytic gliosis and 
glial scars are greatly reduced in EphA4-deficient mice after 
a lateral spinal cord hemisection[57]. in contrast, the genetic 
deletion of EphA4 does not significantly alter the astroglial 
response or cause the development of an astroglial 
fibrotic scar after dorsal hemisection SCi in mice[58]. This 
discrepancy cannot be simply explained by the lesion 
models used. Turnley’s team re-examined astrocytic gliosis 
following injury in EphA4-null mice and revealed that these 
mice no longer show attenuation of astrocyte reactivity, 
while other phenotypes, such as decreased size of the 
dorsal funiculus, are unaltered. They demonstrated that 
the change in the EphA4-mediated astroglial phenotype is 
associated with long-term breeding of the EphA4 colony 
but does not appear to be influenced by the background 
mouse strain[59]. 
Cytoskeleton   Viment in and GFAP are the main 
cytoskeletal intermediate filaments of astrocytes expressed 
during development and adulthood, respectively. After 
SCi, both vimentin and GFAP are up-regulated in reactive 
astrocytes[60]. An analysis of mice that are genetically 
deficient in vimentin or GFAP showed that glial scar

formation appears normal after spinal cord or brain lesions. 
However, less dense scars frequently accompanied by 
bleeding occur in mice double-deficient in vimentin and 
GFAP[61], most likely due to the impaired astrocytic motility 
resulting from the ablation of intermediate filaments[62]. 
Moreover, the genetic absence of vimentin and GFAP 
also improves axonal sprouting[63] and facilitates functional 
recovery in the context of a spinal cord hemisection 
model[64]. 
Transforming growth factor-beta  TGF-beta expression 
increases immediately after SCi in the injured segment[65]. 
Both TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 are detectable in 
macrophages and astrocytes, while TGF-beta1 is also 
neuron-associated[66]. The cellular localization and temporal 
expression pattern of TGF-beta after SCi suggest that early 
induction of TGF-beta1 at the point of SCi modulates acute 
inflammatory responses and glial scar formation[67], while 
the later induction of TGF-beta2 indicates a regulatory role 
in the maintenance of the scar[68].
Signal transducer and activator of transcription and 
interleukin (STAT/IL) family STAT3, which contributes 
to neuro-inflammation[69] and promotes neuronal survival 
and regeneration[70] after SCi, is one of the most important 
transducers in the process of glial scar formation. A marked 
reduction of glial scarring and a significant improvement of 
locomotion occur in animals with conditional knockdown 
of STAT3 compared with their wild-type counterparts[71]. 
Notably, the post-injury inhibition of STAT3 nuclear 
translocation mitigates the proliferation and migration 
of spinal astrocytes, suggesting that regulating STAT3 
is an effective avenue to control the development and 
maintenance of glial scars[72,73]. A wide spectrum of 
extracellular triggers is able to activate intracellular STAT3, 
particularly type i and ii interferons, neurocytokines, and 
growth factors including EGF and platelet-derived growth 
factor[74]. In the case of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family, 
cytokines such as IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor and 
ciliary neurotrophic factor, which undergo dimerization of 
the gp130 signal transduction subunit with other specific 
receptors, direct the activation of STAT3 and elicits changes 
in reactive astroglia and astrocytic scar formation[75–77]. 
Emerging lines of evidence indicate that neutralization of 
pro-inflammatory signals such as IL-6 during the acute 
phase of SCi significantly suppresses the astrocytic 
differentiation-promoting effect of endogenous neural stem/
progenitor cells, implying a cellular impact on glial scar 
formation by IL-6[78].
Moreover, using knock-out mice, S100A[79] and 
SoX9[80] are also reported to be directly involved in glial 
scar formation by promoting reactive astrocytic migration 
and targeting CSPG deposition, respectively. in addition, a 
study of PKC disruption by the inhibitor Gö6976 has linked 
an increase in the regeneration of dorsal column axons 
with the inactivation of CSPGs after dorsal spinal cord 
hemisection[81]. More interestingly, Bhalala et al. recently 
reported that miR-21 regulates astrocytic hypertrophy 
and glial scar progression after SCi, which implicates 
epigenetic regulation as a potential therapeutic target for 
manipulating glial scar formation and improving functional 
performance[82].
Roles of Glial Scars in SCI 
in a relative sense, there are two facets of glial scar 
function in the injured spinal cord. At the acute and 
subacute stages after SCi, the glial scar serves to seclude 
the lesion area from healthy tissue by limiting disruption 
of the blood-spinal cord barrier, the amplification of an 
overwhelming inflammatory response[83] and massive 
cellular degeneration[11]. Gradually, the glial scar has its 
detrimental effect, which is characteristically a long-lasting 
physical and chemical barrier to axonal regrowth during the 
chronic period[84,85]. 
Influence on Axonal Growth
over the past decade, increasing evidence has attributed 
the fai lure of axonal regrowth after SCi to l imited 
intrinsic neuronal plasticity and the local non-permissive 
microenvironment including myelin-associated growth 
inhibitors as well as the glial scar[86,87]. inhibition of glial 
scar formation by deleting key signals that mediate the 
process has shown an overt facilitation of the affected axon 
regrowth. Of note, MRL/MpJ mice are a genetically inbred 
strain that exhibit decreased scarring and fibrosis with a 
rapid regenerative healing response in several somatic 
tissue wounds[88,89]. Bona fide axonal regrowth, including 
sprouting and regeneration, has been observed in MRL/
MpJ mice with dorsal hemi-section and contusion[90,91]. 
However, there are many differences between the two 
studies. In the MRL/MpJ mice with mid-thoracic spinal 
contusion, poor locomotor recovery is accompanied by 
Yi-Min Yuan, et al.    The glial scar in SCi and repair 427
ongoing degeneration both within and surrounding the 
chronic lesion site[89]. On the contrary, MRL/MpJ mice that 
undergo a dorsal hemisection show improved recovery of 
motor function, a reduced astrocytic response, and fewer 
micro-cavities at the injury site[90]. Although a spectrum of 
axonal growth-promoting molecules, such as laminin[92] 
and fibronectin[93], is induced by scar tissue after damage 
to the spinal cord, the prominent chemical constituents 
secreted by reactive astrocytes, CSPGs, stimulate axonal 
regrowth in the inhibitory milieu[94]. Currently, the two 
predominant receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) 
receptors, RPTP-sigma[95] and leukocyte common antigen-
related receptor (LAR)[85] have been identified as functional 
receptors of CSPGs. in RPTP-sigma-deficient mice, the 
regrowth of axons across the CSPG-rich glial scar has 
been reported in many SCi models, including those of 
dorsal column crush, spinal hemisection and contusion[96]. 
Fisher et al. demonstrated that the LAR-CSPG complex 
triggers the inhibition of axonal growth, partially via 
inactivating Akt and activating RhoA signals; furthermore, 
the deletion of LAR in knock-out mice or the blockade 
of LAR with sequence-selective peptides significantly 
overcomes the growth restriction of serotonergic fibers by 
CSPG and promotes functional locomotor recovery[97]. 
Regulation of Neuro-inflammation
The neuroinflammatory response includes the activation of 
tissue-resident microglia and the infiltration of blood-borne 
macrophages, further contributing to secondary damage 
in the spinal cord, along with glial scarring and progressive 
cavitation[98,99]. in the acute stage after SCi, the single-layer 
perivascular basement membrane in the specialized blood-
spinal cord barrier often separates into an inner endothelial 
basement membrane and an outer parenchymal basement 
membrane. Numerous mononuclear phagocytes accu-
mulate in the space between the membranes and infiltrate 
into the surrounding parenchyma. Attenuation of the 
inflammatory cascade exerted by infiltrating monocytes 
occurs during the subacute period following SCi and 
coincides with the appearance of the glial scar and glia 
limitans, suggesting the potential regulation of inflammation 
by glial scarring[100]. Moreover, disruption of astroglial scar 
formation using astrocytic STAT3-CKo mice to augment 
the spread of inflammation after SCi underscores the 
beneficial effect of glial scars on inflammatory restriction[70]. 
From a historical perspective, neuro-inflammation has 
a negative reputation in the context of SCi. However, 
increasing evidence over the past decade has changed 
this perception due to the existence of alternative anti-
inflammatory monocytes[5]. The alternative activation of 
mononuclear (IL-10 producing) phagocytes, in contrast to 
the classic phenotype of pro-inflammatory features, has 
a strong matrix-resolving property to degenerate the glial 
scar depending on the expression of the matrix-degrading 
enzyme MMP-13 [101,102]. More interestingly, CSPGs, 
the predominant component of glial-scar ECM, directly 
activate microglia/macrophages via the CD44 receptor 
and modulate neurotrophic factor secretion by these cells 
during the first two days after injury[18]. These studies 
advance our knowledge of the interaction between glial 
scar formation and the neuro-inflammatory response after 
SCI and emphasize the synergistic impact on the reparative 
process, suggesting a promising strategy for controlling 
neuro-inflammation by manipulating glial scarring.
Targeting Glial Scars to Promote Repair after SCI
SCi, with high morbidity and poor prognosis, including 
paraplegia, hemiplegia and quadriplegia, is a worldwide 
medical problem. Clinically, in addition to surgical 
decompression and spinal stabilization[103], the administration 
of methyl-prednisolone has been used to prevent secondary 
neuronal damage[104]. However, these interferences have not 
translated into significant functional recovery or sparing of 
neuronal tissue. in the past two decades, great progress has 
been made on the development of remedial interventions 
targeting the glial scar formed after traumatic damage to the 
spinal cord.
Physical Interventions
Low-power laser irradiation, a modified physical therapy, is 
used in the treatment of severely injured peripheral nervous 
system and CNS[105]. in SCi, regardless of whether the 
damage is contusive or compressive, the irradiated spinal 
cord reveals a prominent reduction in the extent of the 
astrocyte response, manifesting attenuated CSPG-matrix 
accumulation, glial scar and syringomyelia[106]. in addition, 
the conversion of a normally non-permissive environment 
into a friendly milieu induced by low-dose irradiation is 
conducive to motor recovery after SCi[107].
Based on a study of the injured mammalian spinal 
cord, the instructive effect of an imposed electrical field 
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 421–435428
may be attributed to a shift in the arrangement of reactive 
astrocytes in undamaged white matter near the lesion and 
the significantly reduced number of astrocytes possessing 
oriented cell processes within the injury site, which 
potentially has an influence on glial scar formation after 
SCi[108]. More importantly, in patients with complete SCi, 
implantation of an oscillating field stimulator for 15 weeks 
allows the recording of upper-extremity somatosensory-
evoked potentials at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year[109].
Pharmacological Strategies
Following SCI, the specialized microstructure of the blood-
spinal cord barrier is damaged, and the permeability 
between spinal cord tissue and blood vessels is unres-
tricted until the subacute phase[110]. Thus, by harnessing 
this window of barrier impairment, the delivery of 
pharmacological agents is a feasible approach to treat 
SCi. Agents that have been reported to promote axonal 
regeneration or/and functional recovery after SCi by 
manipulating glial scar formation are listed in Table 2. 
Many studies have provided evidence of the growth-
inhibitory nature of CSPG-containing glial scars, which 
are primary targets for therapeutic strategies after 
SCi[92]. it is well-established that chondroitinase ABC 
(ChABC) significantly ameliorates the hostile-matrix 
microenvironment following SCI by enzymatically digesting 
the glycosaminoglycan side-chains of CSPGs and promotes 
functional recovery[4,111,112]. in accord with these findings, 
a recent study showed that the infusion of ChABC is also 
successful in restoring neuronal glycosylation to normal[113]. 
However, the clinical translation of ChABC may be set 
back by two major challenges: (1) its poor thermostability 
and (2) its synthesis from an Escherichia coli origin, which 
may carry immunological risk[114,115]. in addition to ChABC, 
there is evidence that MMPs can degrade the protein 
backbone of some CSPGs to restrict the formation of a glial 
scar[116], and the process is associated with mitigation of a 
functional deficit; however, axonal dieback is an unpleasant 
secondary response[117]. Grimpe and Silver showed that a 
newly-designed DNA enzyme against xylosyltransferase-1, 
a critical enzyme that initiates glycosylation of the 
protein core of CSPGs, blocks the formation of intact 
glycosaminoglycan-bearing CSPGs in the glial scar and 
allows micro-transplanted dorsal root ganglia axons to 
regenerate around the core of the lesion[118].
Decorin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan containing 
only one glycosaminoglycan chain, is a versatile player 
in regulating glial scar formation following SCi. Mini-
pump administration of decorin into acute stub injuries 
of the adult rat spinal cord inhibits neurocan, brevican, 
phosphacan and NG2 expression[119]. in addition, decorin 
is reported to attenuate glial scar formation in the rat 
cerebral hemisphere[120]. in accord with these findings, 
decorin treatment in acute SCi induces the synthesis of 
plasminogen/plasmin by microglia, and these are known 
to play major roles in degrading the inhibitory components 
of the glial scar and promoting CNS plasticity[121]. More 
interestingly, a recent study showed that decorin has 
the ability to directly stimulate neurons to extend axons 
within CSPG- or myelin-rich environments, suggestive of 
a coherent pharmacological base that suppresses scar-
formation to facilitate axonal regrowth after SCi[122].
it is well established that anaerobic metabolism at 
the lesion site due to the loss of high-energy metabolites 
is an important contributor to secondary damage and 
neurological deficits[123]. Before undergoing a moderate 
spinal cord contusion, rats pretreated with creatine, a 
potent intracellular energy buffer, score better than controls 
in the BBB open-field locomotor rating scale and have 
significantly less scar tissue surrounding the cavity[124]. 
our recent study found that ethyl pyruvate, which is able 
to compensate for cellular ATP synthesis[125], improves 
functional recovery by evoking a significant amelioration 
of the abnormal glial microenvironment after SCi[126]. in the 
damaged cord, glial scar formation is markedly reduced, 
whereas the number of proliferative astrocytes decreases 
in an astrocyte culture scratch injury model after ethyl 
pyruvate administration. Moreover, ethyl pyruvate affects 
activated microglia and CD11b-positive inflammatory cells 
in an anti-inflammatory fashion.
A recent study showed that the delayed expression 
of cell-cycle proteins contributes to astroglial scar 
formation and chronic inflammation after rat spinal cord 
contusion, suggesting that pharmacological agents 
against cell-cycle proteins ameliorate the non-permissive 
microenvironment[127]. Specifically, the use of olomoucine 
to inhibit cell cycle kinases (CDKs) 2 and 5 results in the 
persistent down-regulation of astroglia[128] and microglia[129] 
proliferation within the glial scar around the site of a spinal

lesion, and this, in turn, results in successful neuronal 
sprouting and functional recovery. Similarly, flavopiridol, 
a non-selective CDK inhibitor that also inhibits the 
transcription of cyclin D1, reduces glial scar formation 
and mitigates the functional deficits from 21 days post-
injury[130]. Recently, CR8, a potent and selective roscovitine-
derived inhibitor of CDKs that has been reported to provide 
neuroprotection in experimental traumatic brain injury[131], 
was found to have a beneficial effect after impact contusive 
SCi in rats[132]. The systemic and continuous administration 
of CR8 limits the sustained elevation of cell-cycle proteins 
related to delayed astroglial scar formation and chronic 
inflammation, thus significantly improving the functional 
recovery. 
There is strong evidence that rapamycin is neurop-
rotective and promotes functional recovery by overcoming 
glial-scar inhibition through inhibition of a specific signal 
pathway[50]. Rapamycin, an mToR-selective inhibitor, 
promotes autophagy and anti-inflammation, thereby playing 
a neuroprotective role[133]. Based on a screen of the active 
ingredients of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F., we found that 
triptolide reduces glial scar formation by inactivating the 
JAK2–STAT3 signal pathway[134]. Moreover, observations 
from sporadic studies suggest that compounds such as 
rolipram[135], rose Bengal[136] and 7 beta-oH cholesteryl-
oleate[137] may be beneficial in treating SCI by manipulating 
glial scarring. 
Concluding Remarks
Glial scar formation is an important biological event after 
SCi. Research in recent years has highlighted the pivotal 
and complex roles played by the glial scar in secondary 
damage in SCi. We have discussed recent progress in our 
understanding of the glial scar: its molecular and cellular 
properties; its role in regulating axonal regeneration and 
neuro-inflammation; and its manipulation by physical and 
pharmacological approaches. However, many important 
questions remain to be answered, and the key implications 
of the glial scar need to be further explored. Basic research 
that focuses on investigating the mechanisms underlying 
glial scar formation, especially the role of endogenous 
stem/progenitor cells localized in the parenchyma of the 
injured spinal cord, as well as developing pharmacological 
approaches to manipulate glial scar formation and promote 
axonal regeneration, will be helpful in achieving successful 
therapeutic explorations for SCi.
