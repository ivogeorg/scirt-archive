Spinal cord injury (SCi) results in permanent loss of function leading to often devastating personal, economic 
and social problems. A contributing factor to the permanence of SCi is that damaged axons do not regenerate, 
which prevents the re-establishment of axonal circuits involved in function. Many groups are working to 
develop treatments that address the lack of axon regeneration after SCi. The emergence of biomaterials for 
regeneration and increased collaboration between engineers, basic and translational scientists, and clinicians 
hold promise for the development of effective therapies for SCi. A plethora of biomaterials is available and has 
been tested in various models of SCi. Considering the clinical relevance of contusion injuries, we primarily 
focus on polymers that meet the specific criteria for addressing this type of injury. Biomaterials may provide 
structural support and/or serve as a delivery vehicle for factors to arrest growth inhibition and promote 
axonal growth. Designing materials to address the specific needs of the damaged central nervous system 
is crucial and possible with current technology. Here, we review the most prominent materials, their optimal 
characteristics, and their potential roles in repairing and regenerating damaged axons following SCi.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCi) causes loss of neurons and axons 
resulting in motor and sensory function impairments. There 
are thousands of new cases of SCi in the world annually[1, 
2] occurring often in young adults. The lack of endogenous 
repair and the significant costs to the individual, family and 
society[1] are important motivations behind the continuing 
efforts to develop effective therapies. Promoting axonal 
regeneration is considered a potential repair strategy 
because it could lead to recovery of axonal circuits involved 
in motor and/or sensory function[3]. 
The central nervous system (CNS) neurons are intrinsically 
capable of some regeneration of damaged axons[4] but their 
attempts after SCi are frustrated by structural and chemical 
obstructions in the damaged nervous tissue[5]. Spinal 
cord repair approaches typically lead to small functional 
gains. one feature that most of these approaches have 
in common is a poor axonal regeneration response, 
suggesting that promoting axonal regeneration, including 
synapse formation, is essential to achieve substantial 
functional repair after SCi. if so, it is rational to anticipate 
that effective spinal cord therapies will need to include 
interventions addressing the axon growth-inhibition that 
leads to the poor axonal growth responses.  
over the last decades, bioengineering principles have 
been introduced into the field of spinal cord injury and repair 
through collaborative efforts between basic, translational, 
and clinical researchers. This review focuses on the 
potential application of synthetic and natural biomaterials to 
modify growth-inhibitory terrain in the injured spinal cord to 
elicit axonal regeneration and foster functional restoration. 
Repair-supporting Biomaterials—Polymers
in general, biomaterials for spinal cord repair are used

for their ability to provide passive structural or active 
growth support to damaged axons; some offer both 
through functionalization with biologically-active peptide 
sequences. Numerous natural and artificial materials 
have been tested for their efficacy in repairing the injured 
spinal cord. Application of some of these has resulted in 
functional improvements, indicating their repair potential. 
As introduced above, axonal regeneration is considered 
an important repair mechanism for the injured spinal 
cord. Therefore, this review focuses on materials that 
have shown most promise to elicit an axonal regeneration 
response to foster functional restoration after SCi.
Most biomaterials designed and produced in the 
laboratory and tested for their efficacy to repair the injured 
spinal cord are polymers. Polymers have numerous 
biomedical applications due to their vastly diverse 
properties. Typically, polymers are large two- or three-
dimensional molecules composed of repeating units[6, 7]. 
Polymers can be obtained from natural sources including 
plants, animals, and DNA, or be fabricated synthetically in a 
laboratory. Natural polymers are widely available and tend 
to undergo highly-controlled synthesis resulting in regular 
structures; however, they often contain contaminating 
molecules and are difficult to sterilize[7]. Synthetic polymers 
are easier to sterilize, but are typically susceptible to 
the chosen process of synthesis which often causes 
irregularities in structure and composition[7].  
Currently, there is no consensus in the literature on 
what constitutes the optimal characteristics of biomaterials 
for spinal cord regeneration and repair. However, there 
is increasing theoretical and experimental evidence for 
the use of polymers for the repair of soft tissue such as 
nervous tissue. An important advantage of some polymers 
for spinal cord repair is that they can be designed for in 
situ polymerization and/or cross-linking, therefore needing 
minimally-invasive approaches (injection) to be applied. 
A variety of techniques have been developed and used to 
characterize material properties, optimizing biomaterials 
for use in a tissue-specific repair application. Figure 
1 illustrates some examples of these characterization 
techniques. Using these techniques, biomaterials can 
be fabricated to degrade within a specific window of 
opportunity, be non-cytotoxic, and have mechanical 
properties similar to those of the native tissue to decrease 
fibrolysis[8]. Hydrogels, a category of polymer that are 
highly water-sequestering, specifically seem to fulfill many 
of these requirements that could support the repair of 
damaged nervous tissue.
Hydrogels
Most SCis in humans are contusions[1] that result in an 
irregular-shaped cavity surrounded by spared white matter. 
The preferable way to introduce a biomaterial for repair 
would be injection into the cavity, which would minimize 
additional damage to the nervous tissue. Therefore, a 
number of research groups have investigated injectable, 
in-situ gelling substrates for spinal cord repair[9-11]. Many of 
these substrates are hydrogels, water-swollen cross-linked 
polymer networks capable of imitating the mechanical and, 
to some degree, the architecture of the soft spinal cord 
tissue[12]. Some characteristics of hydrogels that can be 
considered for optimizing their application in spinal cord 
repair are their porosity, degradation, functionalizability, 
biocompatibility, in situ gelling, and elastic modulus.  
Mammalian Extracellular Matrix-based Natural 
Polymers
A variety of natural biomaterials mostly present within 
the extracellular matrix (ECM) provide both structural 
and growth support to axons during development[13, 14] 
and maturity[15] as well as after injury[16]. Collagen, 
laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and proteoglycans/
glycosaminoglycans[14] are all members of this particular 
group of materials. Most ECM components signal their 
axonal growth-promotion through integrin receptors[17] that 
bind, in many, the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide sequence[18]. 
our continuously increasing understanding of the role of 
ECM in axonal growth has fueled many studies of these 
materials to investigate their efficacy for repair (i.e. [19]).  For 
an overview of recent studies that have used mammalian 
ECM materials, the injury models chosen, and the outcome 
measures, see Table 1.
Collagen  Collagen is found naturally as a triple-helical 
protein in mammals[20]. it is the most abundant protein in 
the human body and the main component of the ECM[21]. 
Collagen self-polymerizes in a two-phase process 
(nucleation/growth[20, 22]) which is determined by pH, 
temperature, and polymerization rate[23-26]. The highly-
tunable mechanical properties[27, 28] and swelling of fibers[28] 
allow collagen to form a hydrogel. Collagen signals its

biological actions through α1β1 (monomers) and α2β1 
(fibrils) integrins[29] as well as discoidin domain receptors 
and glycoprotein Vi[30]. in nervous tissue regeneration, 
collagen has been used in scaffolds[31, 32], magnetically-
aligned fibrils[33-36], gels[34, 37], and cell-delivery vehicles[38]. 
Collagen has the innate ability to form magnetically-
responsive fibrils which are capable of directing neurite 
growth and delivering growth factors, both of which can 
be advantages for spinal cord repair. However, if the 
mechanical properties are not properly tuned for the 
environment, collagen may act as a physical barrier for 
regenerating growth cones[39]. Also, one group found a high 
mortality rate (40%) with implanted collagen filaments, 
suggesting that it has potential cytotoxicity[40].  
Laminin  Laminin is a heterotrimeric glycoprotein consisting 
of α, β, and γ subunits that self-assemble in a temperature-, 
pH- and concentration-dependent manner[41, 42]. As a 
major component of basement membrane ECM, laminin 
has frequently been shown to influence neurite outgrowth 
both in vitro[42-45] and in vivo[44, 46-49]. Laminin forms a sheet-
like polymer that is best known for its critical involvement 
in basal membrane formation. Laminin signals through 
a variety of integrins[50]. integrin activation influences 
neurite outgrowth via the formation of a focal adhesion 
complex and the activation of focal adhesion kinase and 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular

signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways[51].
Laminin does not provide structural support and, 
therefore, is not often introduced alone as a biomaterial 
for SCi regeneration. instead, it is combined with other 
supportive materials to enhance growth promotion[35, 39, 52, 53] 
and cell differentiation[54]. Recently, it was shown that the

structure of the laminin polymer may be tied to its signaling 
capabilities. Certain structural configurations can induce 
regeneration and functional recovery when injected alone 
directly into the spinal cord following injury[49].
Fibronectin  Fibronectin is a high molecular weight 
glycoprotein that binds to integrins and to other ECM 
proteins such as collagen[17, 55-57]. Soluble fibronectin 
circulates in the blood and is involved in clot formation, 
while insoluble fibronectin is found in the ECM. Unlike 
some other ECM proteins, fibronectin does not undergo 
spontaneous polymerization, but rather does so via a 
highly-regulated, cell-mediated process[58]. The biological 
activity of fibronectin is mediated by RGD-integrin α5β1 
binding, and also has an additional integrin-binding 
site[59], PHRSN[60, 61], that results in a synergistic effect on 
cell adhesion and the activation of a variety of pathways 
leading to changes in >30 genes[59].  
Although incapable of forming a hydrogel on its own, 
as a potential treatment strategy, it has been used in 
combination with hydrogels for spinal cord repair due to its 
cell-signaling properties through RGD-integrin binding[62]. 
After injury, it has been shown to elicit neurite outgrowth[57]. 
Fibronectin may be most relevant for regenerating 
damaged blood vessels via the α5β1 integrin receptor, 
which in turn could improve nutrient delivery to cells and 
reduce the infiltration of circulating macrophages following 
SCi[63]. Fibronectin has also been used in biosynthetic 
conduits for regeneration in a complete spinal transection 
model[64].
Hyaluronan/Hyaluronic Acid   Hyaluronan/hyaluronic 
acid (HA) is a high molecular weight non-sulfated 
glycosaminoglycan that occurs naturally in the ECM in the 
adult CNS. it plays a major role as the structural component 
in brain ECM[65]. Due to its ability to sequester large 
amounts of water, it readily forms hydrogels both alone[66] 
and (often) in combination with other natural materials such 
as fibronectin[67] and methylcellulose[68] or methacrylate[69]. it 
is biodegradable and functionalizable, and therefore, when 
combined with materials that are not readily degraded, 
it permits tunable concentration-dependent degradation 
rates. HA binds to a variety of membrane-associated 
proteins including versican, aggrecan and  glial HA-
binding protein[65]. Modified HA supports cell attachment 
and migration, and when combined with brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor, may improve regeneration and motor 
function as an implanted scaffold after SCi[70, 71]. Due to 
its natural role as a structural component in the CNS, it 
has been used both alone as well as in functionalized and 
combination formats to provide structure and guidance for 
regenerating axons after injury[71, 72].
Combination ECM-derived Polymers  Recently, some 
groups have focused on creating a more complete 
ECM environment containing multiple molecules from 
native ECM[19]. Previously, it was shown that various 
basement membranes containing a full arsenal of ECM 
molecules enhance neurite outgrowth in vitro[73, 74] and 
axonal extension in the lesioned adult brain[74]. Basement 
membrane is a specific type of ECM secreted by support 
cells and composed of >20 different molecules[75]. They are 
of specific interest for axon regeneration due to their crucial 
role in regeneration in the damaged peripheral nerve[76]. 
Although it is typically difficult to isolate and manipulate 
these fragile substrates without causing damage, recent 
advances have made successful isolation of various 
basement membranes possible[75]. Several combination 
ECM materials isolated from mammalian sources are 
commercially available[52, 77], while others are in various 
stages of development and characterization[19, 78-80].
MatrigelTM is a well-characterized, commercially 
available ECM-derived hydrogel that is a gelatinous mixture 
of proteins secreted by tumor cells[52]. The abundance 
of proteins secreted by this particular cell type makes 
MatrigelTM an easy-to-obtain source of hydrogel-resembling 
natural ECM[52]. Previous studies have indicated its ability 
to promote neurite outgrowth[35, 53] and to serve as a cell-
delivery vehicle[81]. it has been used in a variety of studies 
and in many different combination treatments, with groups 
reporting mostly positive results; however, in some studies, 
axonal regeneration occurred with significant tissue 
loss when MatrigelTM was used to fill a conduit following 
complete spinal transection[82, 83].     
in addition, non-tumor-related sources of ECM have 
also become available. ECM isolated from de-cellularized 
pig bladder was shown to have regenerative potential in a 
variety of organs including esophagus[84] and ligament[78]. 
This potential is likely due to its ability to provide structural 
support, growth factors, and a variety of signaling 
molecules to regenerating tissues[19]. Recently, several 
groups have started to isolate ECM from CNS to study its 
potential as a regenerative substrate for SCi[80,85].
Neurosci Bull     August 1, 2013, 29(4): 445–459450
Non-mammalian Natural Polymers
Natural polymers for neural tissue engineering and 
regeneration can also be obtained from non-mammalian 
sources such as algae, crustaceans, plants, and 
bacteria. An important aspect of these polymers is their 
biocompatibility, i.e., how the mammalian body responds to 
these foreign materials. They typically do not have ligand-
associated interactions with mammalian cells and therefore 
may serve primarily as a supportive matrix. Some of the 
most investigated non-mammalian natural polymers that 
have shown some benefits for nervous tissue repair are 
listed in Table 2.
Synthetic Polymers
Synthetic polymers are championed due to their ability to 
be modified and designer-made with optimal mechanical 
properties and functional sequences for cell signaling and 
controlled degradation. They are also easy to sterilize[7] in 
contrast to natural polymers. The selection discussed here 
has been chosen as a representative subset of the most 
common synthetic polymers that have been used for CNS 
repair (Table 3).
Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacylate) (PHEMA) or poly 
(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate-co-methylmethacrylate) 
(PHEMA-MMA)  PHEMA and PHEMA-MMA are probably 
the most studied water-swelling biomaterials. PHEMA is a 
non-biodegradable, functionalizable hydrogel with many 
medical applications such as contact lenses. Some studies 
suggest it may actively increase axon regeneration[53]. 
PHEMA easily forms designer conduits[114], but these 
are structurally weak with a risk of collapse[115]. Typically, 
copolymerization with methyl methacrylate (PHEMA-MMA) 
offers structurally-stronger scaffolds[114]. The biocompatibility 
of PHEMA has been recognized as a potential problem in 
CNS repair studies.

gene therapy. in chronic SCi, PHPMA was shown to reduce 
the lesion cavity volume and induce axon regrowth[116]. one 
disadvantage compared to PHEMA is that PHPMA shows 
an increase in regeneration-blocking connective tissue after 
SCi[117], which suggests it may work more efficiently when

or therapy to counter the connective tissue deposition.
Poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG)/poly-ethylene oxide (PEO) 
PEG is a water-soluble hydrogel and can be designed to 
be hydrolytically unstable, i.e., biodegradable, or inert, 
i.e., non-degradable[7]. This is an attractive property, 
especially for drug delivery, because it allows for controlled 
degradation. Another quality is that PEG gels can be 
modified to be thermally activated so that they are liquid 
at room temperature but quickly gel in situ[118].  Due to its 
hydrophilic properties, PEG has been useful in repairing 
damaged neuronal membranes when applied directly to 
the injury site immediately following a crush injury[119-122], 
in a delayed application[123], or as a subcutaneous application[124]. 
PEG is favorable as it is functionalizable and groups have 
incorporated cell-binding domains such as RGD[125] and 
iKVAV[126]. it can be used for cell immobilization[127] and drug 
release[128].  Another interesting capability of PEG is that 
it has anti-oxidant actions[129, 130], which may limit secondary 
injury. PEG hydrogels have been used alone[119-123, 129, 130] 
and as factors[128] or cellular carriers[131] after SCi and they 
are generally considered promising candidates for nervous 
tissue repair.
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)  PVA is a degradable, 
biocompatible, non-toxic, carbon-carbon backbone 
polymer[132], which makes it an attractive option for 
biomedical applications.  it is nontoxic, hydrophilic, and has 
good adhesion properties. PVA is commonly used for drug 
delivery directly to the injury site after SCi[133, 134]. PVA forms 
hydrogels with varied mechanical properties based on the 
water-content of the gel[7]. Unless it is functionalized, PVA 
does not directly bind to cell surface receptors and causes 
little immune response[134]. Therefore, unmodified PVA does 
not elicit axonal growth responses. 
Poly(α-hydroxyacids)  Poly(α-hydroxyacids)[135] include 
poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), their co-
polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(lactic-
co-caprolactone) (PLCL). Varying the composition of these 
co-polymers allows for precise control of degradation and 
mechanical properties[136]; however, this class of polymers 
does not form hydrogels. Therefore their use is limited to 
conduits for complete transection. An important advantage 
over other candidates is that they are FDA-approved for 
use in the peripheral nervous system. They have been 
shown to support regeneration after complete spinal 
transection when combined with either growth factors[137] or 
cell transplants[138, 139].  
Axonal Regeneration: A Balance between Growth-
Promoters and Growth-Inhibitors
Many molecules at an injury site directly influence the 
conduciveness of the environment for axonal regeneration. 
Balancing these signals in ways that lead to axonal 
regeneration is an important challenge in the field of spinal 
cord repair. in essence, there are two ways to influence 
this balance in favor of axonal growth: (1) remove/degrade 
growth-inhibitory molecules, such as chondroitin-sulfate 
proteoglycans (CSPGs), myelin-associated glycoproteins, 
and others, and (2) introduce growth-promoting molecules, 
such as neurotrophins (for review see[147]). An important 
role for biomaterials is that of a delivery vehicle for factors 
that, when released in a controlled fashion, may affect the 
growth-inhibition balance so that axonal regeneration is 
achieved.   
Functionalizing Biomaterials to Tip the Balance
Although intrinsically capable of regeneration[4], one reason 
that CNS neurons fail to do so is the excess of inhibitory 
signals within and around the injury site in the spinal cord[5]. 
Many groups address this issue by incorporating molecules 
into biomaterials to counter these injury-related signals over 
a controlled period of time. The enzymes chondroitinase 
(ChABC) (for review see[148]) and sialidase[149, 150], or a 
combination of the two were shown to decrease growth 
inhibition[151]. Many groups have shown that administration of 
ChABC is associated with sensory axonal regeneration[152] 
and functional recovery[148, 152, 153] when experimentally 
introduced following SCi. When comparing the two, one 
group found that sialidase increases axonal regeneration 
and functional recovery[149-151] to a greater degree than 
either ChABC alone or a sialidase/ChABC combination[151].
Alternatively, groups have addressed this issue by 
incorporating growth-promoting molecules into biomaterials. 
Largely, this approach involves either presenting cell-
matrix-binding ligands or growth factors to enhance 
regeneration and encourage infiltration of growing axons 
into and through the lesion site[154].  often, the cell-matrix-
binding ligands are covalently attached to the material 
itself, while growth factors are incorporated during the 
Agnes E. Haggerty, et al.    Biomaterials for spinal cord repair 453
polymerization phase and slowly released as the material 
degrades. Growth factors often used in combination with 
biomaterials are brain-derived neurotrophic factor[71, 155-159], 
neurotrophin-3[156, 159], nerve growth factor[160-162], and ciliary 
neurotrophic factor[155, 159, 163]. These factors appear to act 
on both specific and shared target neurons and affect the 
regeneration of different axonal tracts. This argues for the 
careful choice of growth factor, depending on the deficit 
and measure of recovery. With damage to multiple tracts, a 
combination of factors may be necessary.  
one technique to deliver multiple growth factors from 
a biomaterial is to incorporate stem cells and stem cell-like 
cells that secrete a growth-promoting cocktail of factors to 
the damaged cells within an injury site (for review see[164, 165]). 
Using biomaterials as a vehicle for transplants may offer 
the protection and cues needed to increase survival of the 
transplants in order to prolong their therapeutic effects and 
provide meaningful regeneration and functional recovery. 
in order to best enhance the survival of transplanted cells 
in spinal cord repair, materials should protect the cells 
from sources of cytotoxicity within the injury environment 
(i.e., macrophages and reactive oxygen species), while 
maintaining biologically-active interactions with the 
transplant as a pseudo-ECM. Functionalizing biomaterials 
with specific binding motifs could aid in providing a pseudo-
ECM environment and protect cell transplants from anoikis 
(a form of apoptotic death due to loss of attachment). These 
cell-binding motifs include laminin-associated peptides[166, 167] 
and more generally RGDs[165, 167, 168] and have shown some 
improvements in transplant survival[165-169].
Concluding Remarks
Currently, a plethora of biomaterials is available and many 
more are in development for use in spinal cord repair. Each 
material has benefits and pitfalls when incorporated into 
the injury site. in this review, a subset of materials widely 
used in the field of spinal cord regeneration is presented. 
When testing any biomaterial for spinal cord repair, the type 
of material chosen should depend on the specific needs 
of the injury. The most clinically-relevant injury in humans 
is contusion, which occurs in >75% of all SCi cases. 
Therefore, we argue that injectable, in situ gelling materials 
hold the greatest clinically-relevant treatment potential. 
injectable materials can be delivered either directly to 
the epicenter or adjacent to the lesion site while causing 
little additional damage. of the in situ gelling materials, 
it is necessary that the immunogenicity of the material is 
low and reliable sterilization techniques exist. Currently, 
there is still some concern over the reliable sterilization of 
natural polymers while more techniques are available to 
safely sterilize synthetic polymers. The material should also 
be biodegradable, preferably in such a way that it slowly 
degrades as it is replaced by the naturally-regenerated 
environment. Considering all of this, PEG-based hydrogels 
meet many of these criteria, and when combined with the 
innate ability to sequester reactive oxygen species, it is 
reasonable to expect advances in this particular group of 
in situ gelling materials which could make an important 
contribution to the development of therapies for spinal cord 
repair.
