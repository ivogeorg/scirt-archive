Abstract
Background: Microglia and macrophages (MG/MF) have a diverse range of functions depending on unique
cytokine stimuli, and contribute to neural cell death, repair, and remodeling during central nervous system
diseases. While IL-1 has been shown to exacerbate inflammation, it has also been recognized to enhance
neuroregeneration. We determined the activating phenotype of MG/MF and the impact of IL-1 in an in vivo spinal
cord injury (SCI) model of IL-1 knock-out (KO) mice. Moreover, we demonstrated the contribution of IL-1 to both
the classical and alternative activation of MG in vitro using an adult MG primary culture.
Methods: SCI was induced by transection of the spinal cord between the T9 and T10 vertebra in wild-type and IL-
1 KO mice. Locomotor activity was monitored and lesion size was determined for 14 days. TNFa and Ym1 levels
were monitored to determine the MG/MF activating phenotype. Primary cultures of MG were produced from
adult mice, and were exposed to IFNg or IL-4 with and without IL-1b. Moreover, cultures were exposed to IL-4
and/or IL-13 in the presence and absence of IL-1b.
Results: The locomotor activity and lesion area of IL-1 KO mice improved significantly after SCI compared
with wild-type mice. TNFa production was significantly suppressed in IL-1 KO mice. Also, Ym1, an alternative
activating MG/MF marker, did not increase in IL-1 KO mice, suggesting that IL-1 contributes to both the
classical and alternative activation of MG/MF. We treated primary MG cultures with IFNg or IL-4 in the
presence and absence of IL-1b. Increased nitric oxide and TNFa was present in the culture media and
increased inducible NO synthase was detected in cell suspensions following co-treatment with IFNg and IL-1b.
Expression of the alternative activation markers Ym1 and arginase-1 was increased after exposure to IL-4 and
further increased after co-treatment with IL-4 and IL-1b. The phenotype was not observed after exposure of
cells to IL-13.
Conclusions: We demonstrate here in in vivo experiments that IL-1 suppressed SCI in a process mediated by the
reduction of inflammatory responses. Moreover, we suggest that IL-1 participates in both the classical and
alternative activation of MG in in vivo and in vitro systems.

Introduction
Every year more than 10,000 people in the United States
are victims of spinal cord injury caused by traffic, sports
and other accidents. While medication during the acute
injury period involves the administration of large doses
of steroid and other anti-inflammatory drugs, the recov-
ery of neurological functions relies on the host’s neural
plasticity and compensatory mechanisms. Many of these
patients are permanently paralyzed [1,2]. The spinal cord
injury (SCI) site increases initially due to the invasion of
monocytes such as macrophages (MF) and microglial
cells (MG) which are resident macrophages in neural tis-
sue. MF and MG (MF/MG) activation increases neu-
roinflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines
such as IL-1b and TNFa, as well as reactive oxygen spe-
cies such as superoxide anion and nitric oxide (NO). This
inflammatory spiral gives rise to astroglial scar formation
around the injury epicenter and inhibits the tissue repair
process and neuroregeneration [2].
MF (and perhaps MG as well) have a diverse range of
functions during inflammatory periods depending on
the type of induction caused by unique cytokine stimuli
[3-5]. The classically activated MF brought about by
IFNg, induces the production of IL-1b, TNFa and NO
from inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and works as a
cytotoxic phenotype in which central nervous system
(CNS) damage is exacerbated by inflammation. In con-
trast, it is considered that alternatively activated MF,
which are also known as type M2 MF and are induced
by the stimulation of IL-4 and IL-13, may be involved in
tissue repair and remodeling [5-7]. MF activated in this
manner promote axonal growth and overcome inhibi-
tory substrates [8]. Such MF implanted into the injured
spinal cord have been reported to induce an increase in
axonal regrowth or functional improvement [9,10]. We
have also reported that transplanted human stem/pro-
genitor cells from bone marrow (hMSCs) rescued neural
cell death in the hippocampus after global ischemia; this
process is mediated by the induction of the alternatively
activated MF/MG which is reflected by expression of
the marker Ym1 [11]. Like these, although MF/MG
might tune tissue damage to repair after CNS injuries,
there is little evidence to illustrate the phenotypes after
the injuries. Therefore, we demonstrate the MF/MG
activating phenotype after SCI.
IL-1 plays a crucial role in CNS damage [12-14]. IL-1
contributes to an increase in the size of the lesion after
mechanical- and chemical-induced SCI, while treatment
with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) reduced this
effect [13-16]. Also in the stroke model, treatment with
IL-1b has exacerbated ischemic brain damage [17] while
IL-1ra [18] or IL-1 gene-deficient (KO) mice have
decreased infarct volumes [19-21]. One of the functions
of IL-1 is activation of MG/MF, and IL-1 and its
receptors expressed by MG/MF regulate NO synthesis,
apoptosis and secondary inflammatory responses
[13,19,21,22]. Recent evidence suggests that IL-1b trig-
gers the proliferation and early differentiation of neural
progenitor cells during the development of the spinal
cord and after hippocampal injury [23,24]. It also acti-
vates type II helper T cell induction which has an anti-
inflammatory effect after cerebral ischemia [25]. More-
over, other inflammatory factors, such as TNFa and
iNOS, have been implicated in the neural regeneration
process during tissue repair [26,27]. Therefore, IL-1 or
inflammatory factors could play roles in tissue repair
during subacute periods. Although the alternative acti-
vating phenotype of MF/MG has been suggested in
neural repair processes and IL-1 might also contribute
to neuroregeneration, the participation of IL-1 against
the alternative activation of MF/MG has not been
reported yet.
In the present study, we compared lesion size after
SCI between IL-1 KO and wild-type mice. We then
determined MF/MG activation by measuring marker
levels for 14 days after SCI.
Moreover, we determine that IL-1 influences MG
directly to modulate the alternative activation process in
adult mouse primary MG cells obtained from IL-1 KO
and wild-type mice.
Materials and methods
Animals
Mice with homozygous disruption of both IL-1a and b
genes (IL-1 KO) have been described previously [28].
IL-1 KO mice that had been backcrossed for more than
ten generations into the C57BL/6 strain were used in
these experiments. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were pur-
chased from Charles River Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan).
All mice were housed in the specific pathogen-free ani-
mal facility at Showa University and had free access to
food and water. In all experiments, adult males 8 to 12
weeks old weighing 17 to 25 g were used. All experi-
mental procedures involving animals were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Showa University (#09156, 00136, 00139, and 01157).
Spinal cord injury (SCI) model
The SCI mouse model was produced according to a pre-
vious report [29] with minor modifications. Anesthesia
was induced in mice by inhalation of 4.0% sevoflurane
and maintained with 3.0% sevoflurane. Under aseptic
conditions, an incision was made along the midline of
the skin of the back and the muscles, soft tissues and
yellow ligaments overlying the spinal column between
T9 and T10 were removed. The intervertebral spinal
cord between T9 and T10 was then transected with a
thin-bladed knife. After bleeding had stopped and

coagulated blood was removed, the incision was closed
and animals were given 1.0 mL physiological saline (s.c.)
to avoid dehydration. Following recovery, foods were
placed on the cage floor and the intake of the water bot-
tle was lowered to allow for easy access. All mice were
allowed to recover in a room maintained at 24 ± 1°C
during the experimental period.
Assessment of motor function
Motor function after SCI was compared by using an
open field behavior test that focused on hindlimb func-
tion according to the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) [30].
The BMS consists of an open-field locomotor rating
scale, ranging from 0 (complete paralysis) to 9 (normal
mobility). Briefly, individual mice were placed in the
center of the open-field (for example, 50 × 50 cm
square) with a smooth, non-slip floor and monitored for
four minutes. Hindlimb movements, trunk/tail stability
and forelimb-hindlimb coordination were assessed and
graded. Mice were tested daily for 14 days post opera-
tively (dpo). Mice with peritoneal infection, hindlimb
wounds, and/or tail or foot autophagia were excluded
from the study. Scoring was done by randomly number-
ing the mice to ensure that the investigators were not
aware of the treatment groups.
Measurement of injured area
After anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.
p.), animals were perfused transcardially at 3, 7 or 14
dpo with 0.9% saline followed by 10% buffered formalin
and the spinal cord removed (T5 - L1 vertebrae). Spinal
cords were then post-fixed and prepared in a paraffin
block. Five spinal cord sections (5-?m thickness) were
obtained from each mouse: at the midline which
included the central canal near the core-injury site and
bilaterally at 150 ?m and 300 ?m lateral to the midline
(Total 5 sections from each mouse). The damaged area
can be identified by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
immunostaining of the surrounding area which is con-
sidered to be indicative of glial scarring. The paraffin
sections were deparaffinized and boiled in 10 mM
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 90°C for 20 minutes. Following
incubation in 0.3% H2O2, the sections were blocked
with 5% normal horse serum (NHS) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Subsequently, the sections were incubated
overnight with rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (1:10, DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark). The sections were washed with
PBS and immersed with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 90
minutes. They were then incubated in an avidin-biotin
complex solution (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) fol-
lowed by diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector) as a chromo-
gen. Control staining involved carrying out the same
steps minus the incubation with the primary antibody.
The injured area surrounded by GFAP-immunopositive
cells was measured by image analysis software DP2-
BSW (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the estimated lesion
area was calculated by the average of the injury areas.
Isolation of primary microglial cells from adult CNS
Isolation of primary adult microglia was carried out
according to previous studies [31,32] using a slightly
modified protocol. Briefly, anesthetized mice (sodium
pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg, i.p., n = 20) were perfused
transcardially with ice-cold saline under sterile condi-
tions and the whole brain and upper spinal cord were
quickly removed. The CNS tissues were homogenized
with a Dounce-tissue grinder (Weaton, Millville, NJ,
USA) and further digested by gentle shaking in a diges-
tion cocktail (0.025 U/mL DNase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA), 0.5% dispase II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany),
0.05% collagenase D (Roche), 0.1 ?g/kg TLCK (Na-
Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride;
Sigma) in HBSS (Hank’s balanced salt solution; Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)). After filtration with a nylon
filter (pore size 100-?m), the homogenate was centri-
fuged at 400 × g for six minutes and the pellet washed
with HBSS and centrifuged again. Then, the pellet was
resuspended in 30% isotonic Percoll (GE, Uppsala, Swe-
den), HBSS overlaid on the suspension, and the Percoll
gradient solution was centrifuged at 200 × g for 40 min-
utes. After removing the debris and supernatant, the
pellet was collected, washed, and resuspended with 10%
RPMI1640 medium (10% heat-inactivated FCS (Nichirei,
Tokyo, Japan), 2 mM L-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicil-
lin and 100 ?g/ml streptomycin in RPMI1640 (all from
Invitrogen)) after HBSS washing. The cell suspension
was seeded in six-well plates and incubated with a
change of medium every three to four days for two
weeks until confluency was reached (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). The epitope profile of the cells was deter-
mined by immunocytostaining with antibodies against
CD11b (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), Neu N (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA, a neuronal marker), GFAP (DAKO,
astroglial marker), and myelin basic protein (MBP, Milli-
pore, an oligodendroglial marker).
Activation of primary microglia with cytokines
MF can be activated into several kinds of polarized phe-
notypes depending on the stimulant [3]. We have
reported that the BV-2 mouse microglial cell line can be
activated according to the classical or alternatively acti-
vated phenotypes in response to stimulation by IFNg or
IL-4, respectively [33], with the phenotypes being similar
to those described in previous reports [3]. Primary MG
cultures produced from wild-type and IL-1 KO mice
were washed twice with PBS (-) and replaced with experi-
mental medium (D)MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented

with 1% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ?g/ml streptomy-
cin, and 2 mM L-glutamine). Then the cells (n = 6 in
each phenotype) were exposed to recombinant mouse
IFNg (rmIFNg, 10 ng/mL), recombinant mouse IL-4
(rmIL-4, 20 ng/mL) or vehicle. Cells from half of the cul-
ture dishes were further exposed to 10 ng/mL rmIL-1b
(all recombinant cytokines from PeproTech, Rocky Hill,
NJ, USA). Twenty-four hours later, the medium and cells
were collected and were kept at -30°C until analysis
(Additional file 1: Figure S1).
To determine the contribution of IL-1b on alternative
activation of MG, another set of primary MG were pre-
pared as above. After culturing for two weeks, the MG
were treated with rmIL-4 (20 ng/mL), rmIL-13 (20 ng/
mL) or both (20 ng/mL each) with and without rmIL-
1b. The cells and medium were collected 24 hours after
treatment and were kept at -30°C until analysis (Addi-
tional file 2: Figure S2).
Multiple-Immunostaining
Animals from the 3rd, 7th or 14th dpo were placed
under sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) anesthesia
and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 50 mM phosphate buffer
(pH7.2). The T5 - L1 segment of the spinal cord was
removed and tissues were post-fixed in fixative solution
overnight, followed by 20% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (pH7.2) for two nights. Tissues were then
embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetech,
Tokyo, Japan) and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled iso-
pentane. Ten-micron-thick sections were cut saggitally
on a cryostat. Frozen sections of spinal cord from mice
subjected to SCI were used for immunohistochemical
staining. Primary cultures of microglia-rich cells were
cultured in four- or eight-well permanox chamber slides
(Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA), fixed with 2% PFA for 30
minutes, and used for immunocytostaining to determine
the epitope profiles of the cells.
Tissue sections or chamber slides were washed several
times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) and incubated
in 5% NHS/PBST for 1 hour. Subsequently, the sections
were incubated overnight with primary antibodies. The
sections were then rinsed with PBST and immersed
with appropriate fluorescently-labeled secondary antibo-
dies for 2 hours. Control staining involved carrying out
the same procedures but without the incubation with
primary antibodies. The primary and secondary antibo-
dies used are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Some sections
were stained with 4, 6-diamidine-2-phenylindole dihy-
drochloride (DAPI, 1:10,000; Roche) to identify cell
nuclei. Fluorescence was detected using an Axio Imager
optical sectioning microscope with ApoTome (Zeiss;
Oberkochen, Germany).

cord segments between the T5 and L1 vertebrae were
removed. The tissues were homogenized with lysis buf-
fer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 M NaCl and 1%
Triton X-100, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid
(EGTA), 50 mM NaF, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10
mM sodium pyrvate, and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma)) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 minutes at 4°
C, and the supernatant collected. Protein concentrations
in the samples were determined using the BCA protein
assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA).
IL-1b, TNFa, and/or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-
1) protein levels were determined using a mouse IL-1b/
IL-1 F2 kit (DY401), a mouse TNF-a/TNFSF1A kit
(DY410) and a mouse IGF-1 kit (DY791) respectively, all
of which were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN,
USA). Analyses were performed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions, and data were standardized
according to total protein concentration.
For cell culture experiments, the culture media were
spun down to remove cells and the supernatants used
for the protein detection assays as described in the pre-
ceding paragraph. All in vivo and in vitro samples were
stored at -30°C until use.
Assay for arginase activity and NO production in primary
cultures of MG
Arginase is a marker for alternative activation and its
activity was measured according to our previous report
[33]. Briefly, primary cultures of MG cells were soni-
cated with lysis buffer on ice. The homogenate was
mixed with an equal volume of pre-warmed 50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 10 mM MnCl2 and incu-
bated for 15 minutes at 55°C for activation. The mixture
was then incubated in 0.25 M L-arginine for 60 minutes
at 37°C to hydrolyze urea from L-arginine, and the reac-
tions were stopped by adding Stop solution (H2SO4/
H3PO4/H2O, 1:3:7). Then, a 1% (final concentration)
solution 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione-2-oxime (ISPF,
Wako, Tokyo, Japan) in ethanol was added to the solu-
tion, which was heated at 100°C for 45 minutes. The
reaction between urea and ISPF produced a pink color,
and absorption was measured at 540 nm. Data are pre-
sented as specific activity (nmol/min/mg of protein).
NO production is a marker for the classical activation
of MF [3] and its level in cultured media was measured
using the Griess method (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) as
NOx (NO2
-and NO3
-) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Western blot analysis
Immunoblotting experiments were carried out on spinal
cord sections and cell homogenates. After determination
of the protein concentration, the homogenates were pre-
pared as reduced (except for CD206) or non-reduced
(for CD206) immunoblotting samples. Then, appropriate
amounts of samples were electrophoresed and ftrans-
ferred to polyvinylidinene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). After blocking with 5% non-fat
milk, the membranes were probed with primary antibo-
dies for Ym1, STAT1, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), iNOS,
arginase-1, CD206, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or b-actin (as an internal con-
trol) overnight at 4°C. The membrane was rinsed with
10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20
(TBST) and probed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were
detected by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Dura
Extended Duration Substrate; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA)
and exposed onto X-ray film (Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan).
The films were scanned and the signal densities were
quantified using the UN-SCAN-IT gel analysis program
(Silk Scientific, Orem, UT, USA). The densitometric
data were corrected by an internal control and
expressed as arbitrary units (unit). The primary and sec-
ondary antibodies used are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Statistical analysis
Each mouse was assigned a random number and all data
were collected and analyzed without investigator knowl-
edge of group identities. Data are expressed as mean ±

Statistical comparisons were made by Student’s t-test for
two groups and by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc tests for mul-
tiple groups. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
SCI is suppressed in IL-1 KO mice
Motor function determined by BMS declined quickly
after SCI (0.67 ± 0.10 in each group) and then recovered
gradually up to the 14th dpo in both the IL-1 KO mice
and wild-type controls (Figure 1A). While there was no
significant difference between BMS values on the 1st
dpo, the scale levels improved significantly in IL-1 KO
mice from the 3rd dpo (2.72 ± 0.20, P < 0.05) through
the 14th dpo (5.60 ± 0.26, P < 0.05) compared with the
day-matched wild-type animals (1.70 ± 0.14 and 4.13 ±
0.23, 3rd and 14th dpo, respectively).
The size of the injury area was compared between
wild-type and IL-1 KO mice by using immunostaining
to delineate the area surrounded by GFAP-positive cells
(glial scar) (Figures 1B, C). The damaged site around the
epicenter decreased through to the 14th dpo. The lesion
Figure 1 SCI was suppressed more in IL-1 KO than in wild-type mice. (A) Motor function determined according to the Basso Mouse Scale
improved in a time-dependent manner after SCI in wild-type (open circles) and IL-1 KO mice (closed squares). The score for IL-1 KO mice is
significantly improved compared to the wild-type from the 3rd dpo. Numbers in parentheses indicate sample numbers at each time point. Data
are expressed as mean ± SE. **: P <0.01 (Student’s t-test). (B) Representative images of GFAP-immunostaining after SCI. The injured area as

area was calculated from the spatially-integrated injured
area for both groups, with the lesion area in the IL-1
KO mice being significantly less than that in the wild-
type animals; significant differences were measured at
the 7th (0.21 ± 0.06 mm2 IL-1KO versus 0.35 ± 0.06
mm2 wild-type, P <0.05) and 14th dpo (0.06 ± 0.02
mm2 IL-1KO versus 0.12 ± 0.03 mm2 wild-type, P
<0.05). These results indicate that IL-1 contributes to
development of the lesion after SCI.
IL-1 KO mice showed decreased induction of
proinflammatory cytokines
IL-1b was barely detectable in the spinal cords of wild-
type mice before SCI. The IL-1b level increased after
SCI, peaked at 9.27 ± 1.79 pg/mg protein on the 1st
dpo, remained high through to the 7th dpo, and then
slightly decreased to 6.69 ± 1.49 pg/mg protein on the
14th dpo (Figure 2A). No IL-1b signal could be detected
in IL-1 KO mice (data not shown). We examined
another proinflammatory cytokine, TNFa, the level of
which also increased after SCI (Figure 2B). TNFa in the
wild-type animals peaked at 289.0 ± 41.0 pg/mg protein
on the 3rd dpo and remained high through to the 14th
dpo. There was no significant difference in the TNFa
level between groups prior to the SCI. However, the
TNFa level in the IL-1 KO mice was significantly lower
than that in the wild-type mice from the 3rd dpo (P
<0.01) and remained constant during the experimental
period. IL-1b-positive cells were identified using multi-
ple-immunostaining at three days (Figure 2C). Immu-
noreactivity for IL-1b was detected well at the epicenter
of lesion site. The positive cells were co-localized with
Iba1-expressing cells as an MF/MG marker. However,
an astroglial marker, GFAP-positive reactions were
observed around the lesion site. A neural marker, NSE-
positive cells, decreased in the lesion epicenter and also
in the peri-lesion and was observed in the outside.
Therefore, GFAP- and NSE-positive cells were hard to
co-observe with IL-1b-positive cells (Figure 2C). IL-1b
was not expressed in the IL-1 KO mice (data not
shown).
IL-1 KO mice show decreased alternative activation of
microglia
Alternative activation of MF/MG gene expression
increases in the sub-acute stage after SCI [34]. Our
results were consistent with this, as we found that levels
of Ym1 protein, a marker of alternatively activated MF/
MG, were slightly upregulated post-operatively. Com-
pared with its level on the 1st dpo, Ym1 expression
increased approximately three-fold in wild-type mice in
the subacute phase on the 7th and 14th dpo after SCI
(Figure 3A). The level of Ym1 expression in the IL-1
KO mice was similar to that of the wild-type mice on
the 1st dpo; however, in contrast to the wild-type mice
there was no increase observed on the 7th and 14th
dpo, and levels remained significantly lower. Ym1-
immunopositive cells were identified using multiple-
staining and found to be present mainly around the
lesion site (Figure 3B). There was no obvious difference
in the distribution of these cells between the IL-1 KO
mice and their wild-type counterparts; however, the
density of the positively labeled cells was greater in the
wild-type mice. Merged images showing immunoreactiv-
ity for Ym1 and F4/80 (a MF/MG marker) in both the
wild-type and IL-1 KO mice (Figure 3C) and for F4/80
and IGF-1 (Figure 3D) demonstrated that these markers
were co-expressed in the same cells in both groups,
although to a lesser extent in the IL-1 KO mice. These
results suggest that the absence of IL-1 might result in a
lower level of MF/MG alternative activation.
MG activation is influenced by IL-1b
To confirm the contribution of IL-1 to increase Ym1
and to promote the alternative activation of MF/MG,
we established primary cultures of MG from adult
mouse CNS tissue and stimulated these cells by expos-
ing them to either IFNg or IL-4 with and without IL-1b.
We first determined the epitope characteristics of the
MG by immunocytostaining with markers for microglial
(CD11b), neural (MAP2), astroglial (GFAP) and oligo-
dendroglial (MBP) cells (Figure 4A). Most of the cul-
tured cells stained positively for CD11b antibody, while
none of them stained with GFAP or NeuN antibodies.
We observed that a few cells were stained by the oligo-
dendroglial marker MBP and estimated that > 95% of
the cells were MG.
We then examined the effect of rmIFNg (10 ng/mL)
and rmIL-4 (20 ng/mL) on the microglial activation (Fig-
ures 4B-E). IFNg is an inducer of the classical activating
phenotype while IL-4 is an inducer of the alternative acti-
vating phenotype [3]. In the presence of these cytokines,
we first measured IL-1b levels in the media after a 24-
hour incubation to determine the level of endogenous IL-
1b. However, no endogenous IL-1b was detected by
ELISA (data not shown). Minimal levels of NOx mea-
sured by Griess methods were detected in the standard
MG culture media and this did not change in the pre-
sence of IFNg or IL-4 (Figure 4B). The level of TNFa
increased significantly 24 hours later in IFNg-treated cul-
tures of MG cells from both wild-type and IL-1 KO mice
compared with untreated cultures, but not in response to
IL-4 treatment (Figure 4C). The degree of activation was
much more evident when the cells were exposed to a
combination of IFNg and IL-1b. Exposure of cultured
MG from IL-1 KO mice to IL-1b alone increased the
level of NOx in the culture media, while co-treatment
with IFNg increased NOx even further in a synergistic

manner. However, co-treatment of cultured MG from the
IL-1 KO mice with IL-4 and IL-1b also the increased
NOx level, although to a lesser extent than that seen with
the IFNg and IL-1b co-treatment (Figure 4B). TNFa also
increased in response to IL-1b treatment alone, but not
synergistically for the IFNg and IL-1b co-treatment. Sur-
prisingly, although treatment of IL-4 alone in MG cells
did not increase TNFa in the media, co-treatment with
IL-4 and IL-1b did result in an increase of TNFa in the
media (Figure 4C).
In contrast, treatment of IL-4 alone in MG cells signif-
icantly increased arginase-1 activity in both wild-type
and IL-1 KO mice. Co-treatment of IL-4 with IL-1b
gave rise to a synergistic increase of arginase-1 activity,
while treatment with IL-1 alone did not (Figure 4D).
IGF-1 levels increased in response to exposure to IL-4
and decreased in the presence of IFNg. Co-treatment of
IL-4 with IL-1b in MG showed a similar effect to that
seen following treatment of IL-4 alone, although most
of all experimental groups tended to decrease with the
addition IL-1 treatment (Figure 4E).
Further characterization of the form of MG activation
was carried out with immunoblotting experiments (Fig-
ure 5). STAT1 was mostly upregulated by IFNg and IL-
4 alone or co-treatment IL-4 with IL-1b did not influ-
ence the signals (Figure 5A, B). COX2 was mostly upre-
gulated by IL-1b. While IFNg did not influence the
signals, co-treatment IL-4 with IL-1b tended to increase
the signals synergistically (Figure 5A, C). iNOS expres-
sion evolved in a similar manner to that of NOx pro-
duction (Figure 5A, D). Its signal could not be detected
in response to the incubation of cultured MG cells with
IFNg or IL-4 alone. Co-treatment of the cells with IFNg
and IL-1b, however, resulted in a significant increase of
iNOS levels. Levels of Ym1 and arginase-1, as markers
of alternative activation, increased similarly with

adult wild-type mice. The cells stain with the microglial marker CD11b, but not with the neuronal and astroglial markers, NeuN and GFAP,
respectively. A few cells are stained with the oligodendroglial cell marker, MBP. NC (inset) is the primary antibody-free negative control. The
microglial cells (n = 3 each group) were stimulated for 24 hours in the presence of the vehicle alone, or supplemented with IFNg or IL-4 in the
presence or absence of IL-1b. Total NO (NOx; B), TNFa (C), arginase specific activity (Arg-1 spe. act.; D) and IGF-1 (E) were determined from the
media or cell suspensions. (B) NOx levels increase upon exposure of the cells to IL-1b and in a synergistic manner upon co-treatment of cells
with IL-1b and IFNg, but not when the cotreatment is with IL-4. (C) TNFa levels increase upon exposure of the cells to IFNg, and further upon
co-treatment with IL-1b. Surprisingly, the co-treatment of the cells with IL-4 and IL-1b induced the highest TNFa level among the experimental
treatments used. (D) Arg1-specific activity increased significantly upon exposure to IL-4 and further increased when IL-4 and IL-1b were
employed together. (E) IGF-1 levels decreased with exposure of the cells to IFNg and increased in response to IL-4. The response was partially
inhibited by cotreatment of the cells with IL-1b. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). *: P < 0.05, **: P < 0.01, ***: P < 0.001 compared with

arginase-1 activity. Ym1 and arginase levels increased in
response to treatment with IL-4 alone (Figure 5A, E, D),
but significantly more so in response to co-treatment
with IL-4 and IL-1b. Another marker of alternative acti-
vation, CD206 (mannose receptor), also increased in
response to treatment of cells with IL-4 in the presence/
absence of IL-1b (Figure 5A, G).
MG are polarized to the alternative activating phenotype
by IL-4 and not by IL-13
It is known that the alternative activation of MF
induced by IL-4 and IL-13 is mediated by the IL-4
receptor pathway [3,5,35]. As such, we treated MG cell
cultures with rmIL-4 (20 ng/mL), rmIL-13 (ng/mL) or
IL-4 plus IL-13 (IL-4/IL-13) in the presence or absence
of IL-1b (Figure 6). IL-1b-treated cell lysates showed
similarly increased COX2 levels to that seen in experi-
ments described in Figure 5C (Figure 6A, B), while IL-4-
treated MG again showed increased Ym1 expression.
However, in the presence of IL-13, MG cell lysates did
not show any increase in Ym1, nor when IL-1b was
added exogenously to the culture medium. IL-4/IL-13
treatment showed a mostly similar expression of Ym1 to
that seen with IL-4 treatment alone for MG cells from
both the wild-type and IL-1 KO mice (Figure 6A, C).
Arginase-1 levels increased dramatically and in a similar
manner in response to exposure of cells to IL-4 alone
and for IL-4/IL-13 co-treatment with IL-1b. Arginase-1
levels either did not change, or only changed slightly in
response to exposure to IL-13 alone and were not
enhanced by IL-13 and IL-1b co-treatment (Figure 6A,
D). CD206 signals from MG cells were similar in
response to IL-4 or IL-4/IL-13 treatment, and did not
change in response to additional IL-1b co-treatment.
However, cells treated with IL-13 in the presence or
absence of IL-1b showed CD206 signals that were
approximately half that seen for the IL-4 and IL-4/IL-13
treatments (Figure 6A, E). These results suggest that
cultured adult MG cells take on the alternative activa-
tion phenotype in response to IL-4 and are less likely to
do so in the presence of IL-13. Again, the alternative
activation of the MG is modulated by additional IL-1b.
Discussion
MF/MG have a diverse range of functions during CNS
diseases depending on the type of induction caused by
unique cytokine stimuli. Although many papers have
reported that the MF/MG play a role in the induction
of inflammation and neural cell death by releasing pro-
inflammatory cytokines and producing oxidative stress,
recent evidence also suggests the a phenotype of MF/
MG contributes to the repair and regenerative process
after the diseases [3-5]. In the present study, we demon-
strated the MF/MG activating phenotypes 14 days after
SCI. Moreover, to observe the influence of IL-1, we
compared the lesion size and MF/MG activation using
IL-1 KO mice. Our studies clearly showed that IL-1 KO
mice have a smaller lesion size and less motor deficit
than the wild-type mice. Interestingly, although IL-1 KO
mice had a suppressed TNFa level, an inflammatory
marker, from the 1st dpo, the animals also had a
decreased Ym1 level which is an alternative activating
MF/MG marker at the 7th and 14th dpo. To confirm
the phenomenon, we established adult mouse primary
MG cultures, and examined cell responses to the cyto-
kines IFNg and IL-4 directly with and without IL-1b.
These results suggest that IL-1 might participate in the
classical and alternative activation of MF/MG.
Previous reports have suggested a contribution of IL-1
in acute CNS diseases such as SCI [13,14,16,36], cere-
bral ischemia [19-21], trauma [37,38], and subarachnoid
hemorrhage [39]. However, no direct evidence from IL-
1 KO mice has demonstrated the contribution of IL-1
to SCI. Our results were consistent with previous stu-
dies that IL-1 or IL-1 receptor signaling pathway contri-
butes to increase lesion size of the SCI. An increase in
IL-1b and a decrease in IL-1ra were observed after SCI,
and IL-1b administered into the spinal cord impaired
locomotion. Moreover, administering IL-1ra into the
spinal cord reduced IL-1b levels and locomotion recov-
ered [16]. IL-1 consists of two molecular subtypes, IL-
1a and IL-1b [40]. IL-1a is expressed continuously
while IL-1b is inducible in response to injury. We used
IL-1a and b KO mice because it has been reported that
IL-1a -or b-alone KO mice do not give rise to the neu-
roprotective phenotype after ischemia [20]. It has also
previously been shown that a post-traumatic neuroin-
flammatory response was involved in the development
of injury, and that IL-1 worked as a key inflammatory
player that mediated the neuroinflammatory response
[41]. This is supported by results showing that IL-1
recruits monocytes to enhance the inflammation
mediated by IL-1 receptor I and via a MyD88-dependent
pathway [42]. Down-regulation of the IL-1 receptor
pathway and IL-1-mediated inflammatory responses
becomes a strategy for the suppression of SCI. To this
extent, several recent studies have shown that IL-1
receptor antagonists are able to reduce the severity of
symptoms after experimental SCI [14,36,43,44]. From
these results, we confirmed that our experimental condi-
tion did not differ obviously from the previous one and
that a deficiency of IL-1 worked as a suppressor of SCI.
We then undertook experiments to determine whether
IL-1 deletion affected the inflammatory response. Time-
dependent changes in the levels of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-1b and TNFa in the spine after SCI were
measured with ELISA. It has been reported that pro-
inflammatory cytokines including IL-1b, IL-6, and

TNFa are induced rapidly following SCI [45-49]. In the
present study, IL-1b levels in the spine of wild-type
mice after SCI were drastically increased from the 1st
dpo and were sustained until the 14th dpo. Immunohis-
tochemical studies suggested that IL-1b was expressed
in MF and/or MG. The results suggested that IL-1 con-
tributes to the inflammatory responses after SCI. The
TNFa level in the wild-type mice was increased in the
spine from the 1st dpo and was sustained until the 14th
dpo. However, the TNFa level in IL-1 KO mice did not
increase after injury and remained at significantly lower
levels during the experimental period compared with
that seen in wild-type mice. The results suggest that IL-
1 participates in the upregulation of expression of
TNFa, probably following the induction of a series of
inflammation events after injury.
Recently, it has been suggested that IL-1b triggers the
proliferation and early differentiation of neural progeni-
tor cells during development of the spinal cord and
after hippocampal injury [23,24]. Moreover, other
inflammatory factors such as TNFa and iNOS were
implicated in aspects of neural regeneration during
wound-repair [26,27]. In the present study, we found
that IL-1b levels remained high up to the 14th dpo
despite a decrease in the size of the lesion site. We then
postulated that IL-1b might be performing in a different
role during part of this period, and, therefore, carried
out immunoblotting experiments to examine Ym1 levels
in response to SCI. Ym1 has been reported as an excel-
lent marker of alternative activation of MF and/or MG
[50], which is one of the activation phenotypes induced
by IL-4 and IL-13 [3-5] and plays an important role in
the resolution of inflammation and promotion of wound
healing [3,50]. Alternative activating MF/MG gene
expression increases during the sub-acute stage after
SCI [34]. The alternative activation of MF promotes
axonal growth and overcomes inhibitory substrates [8].
MF implanted into the injured spinal cord increase axo-
nal regrowth and/or functional improvement
[9,10,51,52]. Immunoblotting for Ym1 revealed higher
levels at the 7th and 14th dpo in wild-type mice than in
IL-1 KO mice, with immunoreactivity concentrated
around the lesion epicenter in injured spinal cord. The
Ym1 immunoreactivity coincided with that of immunor-
eactivity for F4/80 and the growth factor IGF-1, which
is known to increase alternative activation of MF/MG
and plays an important role in neuroprotection
[11,53,54]. We postulated that IL-1 might contribute to
Ym1 expression, and to the induction of alternative acti-
vation. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-1
increases the inflammatory response and might also
increase tissue repair and anti-inflammatory resolution
via the induction of alternative activation of MF/MG in
response to SCI. Unfortunately, we were unable to
differentiate between MG and MF because there is no
specific immunohistochemical marker available to sepa-
rate them.
Then, we established adult mouse primary MG cul-
tures and examined cell responses to the cytokines IFNg
and IL-4. Moreover, we added IL-1b to this system to
observe its effect because we could not detect endogen-
ous IL-1b in the media after exposing cells to either
IFNg or IL-4 alone. We have previously reported that
NOx and TNFa levels in the media of primary cultures
of the mouse MG BV-2 line increased in response to
exposure to IFNg alone [33]. Other studies using rodent
primary MG obtained from the pups and the BV-2 cell
line have also shown an increased expression of inflam-
matory mediators (TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6, COX-2) and
iNOS after MG stimulation by IFNg and LPS [55-57]. In
the present study, while the level of TNFa increased in
response to IFNg treatment, NOx did not. However,
NOx was drastically increased by co-treatment with
IFNg and IL-1b; iNOS levels as determined by immuno-
blotting behaved similarly. Moreover, other alternative
activation markers such as arg 1 (activity and protein
level), IGF-1, Ym1 and CD206 [3,7,54] did not increase
upon exposure to IFNg in the presence or absence of
IL-1b. These results indicate that MG polarizes to the
classical activating phenotype by IFNg and/or IL-1b
[3,53]. Some minor differences with other studies exist,
with discrepancies perhaps due to differences in the
source and type of cells and experimental conditions
used.
By contrast, MG exposed to IL-4 showed an increase
of arginase activity, as well as increased arg-1, IGF-1,
Ym1 and CD206 protein levels, but not NOx, iNOS or
TNFa. These characteristics clearly indicated that the
MG polarized to the alternative activating phenotype
[3,53]. Surprisingly, co-treatment of MG with IL-4 and
IL-1b further increased arg-1 activity, and arg-1 and
Ym1 protein levels towards the alternatively activated
phenotype. Because treatment of MG with IL-1b alone
did not increase these factors, it is suggested that IL-1b
has a supportive effect on IL-4-induced responses and
supports the induction of the alternative activating phe-
notype in adult mouse MG. However, another alterna-
tive factor, CD206 was not enhanced and IGF-1 tended
to decrease following IL-1b co-treatment with IL-4. The
co-treatment of MG with IL-4 and IL-1b gave rise to an
unexpectedly high TNFa level as well. Because exposure
of MG to IL-4 alone did not increase the level of TNFa,
the co-treatment is considered to be the result of a
synergistic effect between IL-1b and IL-4. To date, no
evidence has been reported to show that IL-4 works as
an enhancer of the IL-1b response. IL-4/IL-13 has basi-
cally been considered to antagonize the IL-1b function
[58] by enhancing the production of IL-1ra and the

decoy IL-1b type II receptor [59,60]. Moreover, IL-4/IL-
13 downregulated the pro-IL-1b cleavage enzyme, cas-
pase 1, to convert it to an active mature form [61,62].
However, a small number of papers have reported that
an alternative activating phenotype is classified into sub-
phenotypes. A sub-phenotype of MF, M2b is influenced
by IL-1b. It has been reported that M2b induces TNFa
and IL-10 production [54,63,64]. However, the main
role and phenotype of M2b remain unclear. Moreover,
there is no evidence to show that IL-4 participates in
the polarization of this phenotype. Different reactions of
alternative markers by co-treatment of IL-4 and IL-1b
might be due to sub-phenotypes of alternative activating
MG. Further studies are needed to clarify the relation
between the cytokine network and MG polarization.
Finally, we determined the possible involvement of IL-
4 and IL-13 in the adult MG alternative activating
response. Many research and review articles have indi-
cated that both IL-4 and IL-13 function similarly as acti-
vators of alternatively polarized MF [7,35]; however this
has not been studied in detail in adult MG. We applied
IL-4, IL-13, or IL-4/IL-13 to primary cultures of adult
MG with and without IL-1b to demonstrate a putative
signaling mechanism for MG alternative activation, and
found that Ym1, arg-1 and CD206 were enhanced by
IL-4 and IL-4/IL-13, but not by IL-13 alone. Because
the levels of induction between IL-4 and IL-4/IL-13
were very similar, we thought that the effect of induc-
tion depended on IL-4. Moreover, even if MG cultures
were co-treated with IL-13 and IL-1b, the Ym1 and arg-
1 did not further increase in the same manner as for IL-
4. Two IL-4 receptors, type I IL-4 receptor (IL-4RI) and
type II IL-4 receptor (IL-4RII), mediate IL-4’s functions
[7,35]. IL-4RI is exclusive for IL-4, while IL-4RII binds
both IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4RI is expressed predominantly
in hematopoietic lineage cells and IL-4RII is expressed
in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells [35].
Although we did not determine the expression of the
IL-4 receptors, the present results suggest that adult
MG are polarized to the alternatively activated pheno-
type by IL-4 but not by IL-13, and that some MG func-
tions might be mediated through IL-4RI. Further
analyses are required to determine what IL-4 receptor(s)
is involved in the present phenotypes, and what differ-
ences exist between MG and MF in this respect.
Alternatively activated MF are now regarded as a con-
tinuum of functionally and phenotypically related cells,
with a critical role in the resolution and tissue repair
phases [3,7,54]. Indeed, it has been reported that
immune cells contribute to the maintenance of neuro-
genesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood
because immune-deficient mice showed impaired hippo-
campal neurogenesis that could not be enhanced by
environmental enrichment [65]. Previously, it was
suggested that IL-1b itself contributed to the prolifera-
tion and differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the
spine and hippocampus, and to nerve regeneration by
promoting neurite outgrowth following nerve injury
[23,24,66]. A mixture of murine recombinant IL-1b, IL-
6 and TNFa administered to the lesioned spinal cord
four days after the lesion significantly decreased the
amount of tissue loss seven days after trauma compared
with vehicle-administered controls [41]. Moreover, gene-
deficient mice have been used to show that TNFa and
iNOS are implicated in neural regeneration during
wound-repair stages [26,27]. This accumulated evidence
lends itself to the suggestion that the relationship
between IL-1 and IL-4 and the alternative activation of
MG might be implicated in neurogenesis. The manner
in which the enhancement of alternative activation mar-
kers following co-treatment with IL-4 and IL-1b contri-
butes to wound healing, repair and neurogenesis needs
to be examined more in detail, as does the way in which
immune/inflammatory responses tune the switching to
resolution and regeneration following SCI and in other
CNS diseases.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated here in in vivo
experiments that IL-1 exacerbates the effects of SCI by
accentuating the impact of the inflammatory responses.
Moreover, the results of in vivo and in vitro experiments
suggest that IL-1 participates in the classical and alter-
native activation of MG. Finally, we suggest that the
alternative activation of adult MG is regulated via an IL-
4 signaling pathway that could be mediated by IL-4RI.

study (1). Microglial cells were isolated from 20 adult mouse brains and
upper spinal cords by Percoll density gradient. The cell suspension was
plated on 3 of 6-well multiple plate. After culturing with RPMI based
media for 2 to 3 weeks, the media were replaced by experimental
medium and added the medium (as a vehicle), or IFNg (10 ng/mL) or IL-
4 (20 ng/mL) in the medium. Within a few minutes, IL-1b (10 ng/mL)
was also added to half of the wells. The details of the methods are
